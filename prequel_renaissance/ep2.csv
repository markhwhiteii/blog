10h ago,2,The low point in the Star Wars saga until Disney got their hands on it.
18h ago,4,"Wow, very evolutionary, because it showed us the origin of what the empire will be with the army of the clones, and more events during the development of this installment, although the evolution of our heroes is a bit slow, in the end it works , It is brilliant."
"Apr 17, 2021",1.5,It's just as bad if not worse than The Phantom Menace.
"Apr 15, 2021",3.5,"This movie was great, the only problem I have is that the first half is very boring and has a lot of corny love between Padme and Anikan. BUT the second half was amazing! which totally makes up for the first half/"
"Apr 15, 2021",3,"This is my least favourite Star Wars movie, it doesn't mean that i hate it, it's just the one that i think has the most flaws.
I acctually enjoy most of this movie, especially the action sequences and Obi-Wan but the romance badly written and some plot holes make this the weakest of the series."
"Apr 14, 2021",2,"SUPER-bland, airless computer graphics movie hampered by unfavorable comparison to a completely different (and more successful) movie aesthetic created in the Star Wars timeline twenty years earlier.

""Classic"" Star Wars characters (played by puppets or robotic props) appear, for instance the absurd ""Yoda showdown"" that shows how bad CGI animation, improbably storytelling and a general Big Hollywood Flair for shallow, sugary details can disappoint an audience. Critics at the time couldn't be bothered being nice to this one either; unfortunately none other than George Lucas was behind the wheel, suggesting whatever gift he had for tactile fantasy sequences and dynamic casting had completely left him at this point. The great concept artist Ralph McQuarrie from the original trilogy didn't appear at this point, replaced by someone that likes insectile, flimsy design and over-cluttered backgrounds. Motion picture release spawned retail toy items, low quality ""Clone Wars"" animated spinoff feature also."
"Apr 12, 2021",4,"Super interesting and engaging story, although the execution isn't perfect. Like Episode 1, the action is phenomenal and the last 30 minutes has some of the best sequences of the whole saga. Also, I find the mystery plot line with Obi Wan to be very enjoyable and the romance with Anakin and Padme to be a little cringe worthy at times, but it's realistic and makes sense."
"Apr 10, 2021",5,A guilty pleasure. Call me crazy but I love the prequels.
"Apr 09, 2021",2,"I don't know how the critics favour this more than phantom menace. Honestly, Episode I and II are the weakest films in the prequels. Especially this one. Once again we get film sets and cgi galore that do look great, but we get poorly written dialogue, strange acting that feels unnatural and a plot that just seems improvised the more the film goes on. The romantic chemistry is worse than Twilight. Yeah, you heard me. In conclusion, this film gets a star for good special effects/sound and a star for the soundtrack."
"Apr 08, 2021",1,"Eurghhhhhhhh another interminably boring Star Wars film. Please put me out my misery. One more to watch tomorrow. 

Plus points, slightly better CGI than prior films and Nathalie Portman wearing tight white trousers and crop top. Downsides? Literally everything else."
"Apr 03, 2021",2.5,Movie had its moments. it could've had more action and less romance.
"Apr 01, 2021",2.5,The dialogue is awful and the effects are dated but at least the story makes more sense than its predecessor's.
"Apr 01, 2021",5,"Ok I get the criticism, but Jango Fett tho. I'm mean I'm Richard and its Star Wars so obv I love it."
"Mar 23, 2021",3.5,This movie is alright a few people think this is the worst star wars movie and I completely disagree I mean it had way less Jar Jar Binks in it he is is kind off less in is kinda less annoying in this movie then he was in The Phantom Menace. The movie had a rather good plot line with the clones . Is there downsides? yes there's a few but like one you know who Darth Sidious is a mile away and the Anakin and Padme scenes are sometimes cute but mostly cringy . And Count Dooku is the best bit of the film he is a amazing villian and has a very scary personality
"Mar 23, 2021",3.5,Ohne Romanze ist es ganz gut.
"Mar 22, 2021",1.5,Second worst star wars movie. The whole thing felt like a joke.
"Mar 21, 2021",2,20.03.2021 ---------
"Mar 20, 2021",5,How you like me now that you’ve seen the last 3 episodes? Huh ??? In comparison this is so much better. 
"Mar 19, 2021",3.5,"A slight step down from the previous Star Wars film but it's still worth viewing at least once. This is the digital Star Wars movie and perfectly expresses just how far ahead of his time George Lucas was because frankly the technology wasn't there for what they needed for so much of this movie. Hayden Christensen's performance has been criticized but I have 2 key things that you've probably never realized before that totally fix his performance: it's not his fault if it's bad, it's George Lucas's directing because it's his vision of Anakin Skywalker. But then again have you ever considered that Anakin is a 19 year old hormonal teenager with NO romantic experience with women? That solves pretty much the whole problem with him. Yes it's cringy but it does make sense. Pretty much the whole 3rd act of this movie is and forever will be an absolute blast and you shouldn't skip this movie on your Skywalker Saga binge watch because it's a lot more critical than you realize."
"Mar 19, 2021",4,"There is room for improvement, but I'm satisfied with Attack Of The Clones. A pretty solid plot and some great thrills make this a nice star wars flick in my opinion."
"Mar 19, 2021",5,"An underrated film with unique characters , great music scores , and a continuation of the Phantom Menace .This movie starts the setup of Anakin's fall to the dark side. We also see some great CGI scenes and also things we've never seen before. Like all the Jedi coming together in a battle and the romance between Anakin and Padme combined with one of the best music scores in Star Wars."
"Mar 19, 2021",4,Fantastic second entry in the PT
"Mar 15, 2021",4,"Desde mi punto de vista es la peor de Star Wars, pero eso no implica que tenga una mala historia."
"Mar 15, 2021",1,"Garbage movie where they decided to slaughter Anakin's character and make him a gay guy with gay voice lines. ""I hate sand"" what a joke. Fight scenes were alright tho."
"Mar 14, 2021",2,The worst Star Wars film.
"Feb 26, 2021",3,I didn't like this movie as much as the other ones either. I didn't like the way that the directors executed the story but I think it could've been better.
"Feb 25, 2021",2,Nothing more than a long lovestory with a huge battle at the end to try and redeem it. Nothing more needs to be said and don't try and defend it
"Feb 24, 2021",2.5,"O PIOR FILME DE STAR WARS QUE É A MAIOR SAGA DA HISTÓRIA PELO MENOS PARA MIM, E A MINHA FAVORITA."
"Feb 23, 2021",5,"Just, simply perfect..."
"Feb 23, 2021",3.5,"While Episode II seems to wander from the story it needs to get to the point of, it ultimately serves as a thrilling - and sometimes touching - middle movie."
"Feb 22, 2021",3.5,"I know that it is not the best Star Wars Movie but there a some scense and Charcters that i just like to much to give this moive a bad review. And after all its the introduction of the Clone Wars, which also introduces the awesome series ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"""
"Feb 21, 2021",4.5,"This is a Star Wars movie to remember! Fun, great story, character development, plot twists, and the action is fantastic."
"Feb 20, 2021",4.5,"A much better film than the phantom menace, that may be an unpopular opinion, but its mine and I'll explain. I have only 2 flaws with the movie the love scenes and the actor who played young boba fett. By god the love scenes were pretty bad, not awful, but really bad, the actor who played young boba fett daniel loga, could not act and was suprisingly even worse than Jake lloyd. But the good stuff in my opinion, is great. The best thing(s) in this movie are Ewan Mcgregor's performance, Jango fett &amp; the humor. Ewan mcgregors performance is weakest here in the franchise, but still delivers a great performance, its subtle calm and would be what I think a young obi wan would  talk, look and sound like. The humor is best here in the star wars franchise, there is a scene where obi wan gets a drink and a person tries to sell him jedi drugs and he uses his jedi mind tricks to tell him to go home and rethink his life. And Jango fett is one of my absoloute favortie star wars characters. He's a much better character than boba fett, because, he has actual character, he's tough, convincing he looks really cool he can fight well and take out as many people as possible. Hayden christensen cant deliver dialouge too well, but can really act and look like a young darth vader, they give him flaws in this one, which makes it much better, because he is no longer a perfect character and now he seems more like a character. Natalie portman does a good job as padme for the most part. the dialouge, not counting the love scenes, are good and much better than the phantom menace. This one also has less jar jar and the cgi still looks good especially with all the clones and the battle with them is great. I love the character of count dooku and christopher lee once again brings a great performance. The character, while no the best, is not the worst either. I do think the scene where yoda is fighting dooku gets a lot of flack just, beacsue its yoda with a lightsaber, but whats overlooked is that dooku knows that both of them have too much power with the force and they have to batle qith a lightsaber to determine who is the more skilled and well trained. The score is again great, with the beautiful love theme is another one of John Williams best. Attack of the clones 87% A-"
"Feb 18, 2021",1.5,Palpatine's plane is based on luck.Anakin Skywalker is a mad men.This movie isn't fun to watch.Don't make this your first time watching Star Wars
"Feb 15, 2021",5,"Has one of the most epic moments in modern cinematic history, when Anakin is racing through the desert on his speeder looking for his Mother I get chills every time. Definitely one of the best Star Wars movies ever made! This film fixes all the errors of the previous film and improves what the previous movie did right in every way."
"Feb 07, 2021",5,"Yeah, this is awesome."
"Feb 02, 2021",3,"Better than 'Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace', though 'Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones' is again rather underwhelming - if still good on its own merits.

Liam Neeson is missed, with the likes of Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen and Christopher Lee failing to set the world alight. McGregor does give the best performance of that quartet; Christensen possibly the weakest, though his character's story is probably the most interesting - or its overall arc, at least.

Those onscreen aren't helped by the dialogue, which is very basic and run-of-the-mill. I found the score a little forgettable, even if it's still fun to hear the key pieces of it. The plot is watchable, but I did expect greater storytelling from these two follow-up releases to the original trilogy. The CGI is, marginally, an improvement on this film's predecessor."
"Jan 30, 2021",2,"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a bad movie. The best parts of this movie are easily the music,  Ian McDiarmid as The Emperor, Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi and of course, Sir Christopher Lee as Count Dooku otherwise known as Darth Tyranus. Other than that this movie is not good, the plot is somewhat passable, the performances are even worse than before (especially with Padme), the dialogue is atrocious and the CGI, while better than the CGI in TPM is beginning to age. Still better than the previous movie though."
"Jan 28, 2021",2,latarki świetlne włączone ale wszystko jakoś bez polotu
"Jan 28, 2021",3,Mixed feelings I have on this movie. It’s not bad but can be very slow for big chunks and the dialog is sub-par at best. Way too much CGI which hasn’t aged particularly well. 
"Jan 26, 2021",4,"Terrible  dialogue, but the amazing action and the great villain of Count Dooku makes it justice"
"Jan 23, 2021",3,"George Lucas is very talented, but OH GOD, he is not fit to write romance. This is what ultimately drags down this movie. The cringe dialogue, the overuse of CGI- it's all in there. A lot. This movie was disappointing, it could've been better, and it is a downgrade from The Phantom Menace. But it's not a terrible movie, it's not a good movie (by any means!), and I would go as far to say it's more bad than OK. But at least it's not Disney Star Wars bad."
"Jan 22, 2021",3.5,Some of the most incredibly awkward dialogue in any movie I've ever seen. The light saber battle at the end was epically bad. Which was disappointing considering how amazing the darth maul fight in TPM was.
"Jan 21, 2021",4,"Episode II starts off a bit slow. There's only one major action scene in the first hour, Anakin and Obi Wan chasing the assassin. I wasn't particularly excited about that scene. It was ok. I'm sure 20 years ago it would have seemed much more impressive. But now it's 2021 and I've seen a lot of impressive chase scenes. It still holds up, though. It's not the fault of the movie. So after around an hour, we get a pretty cool action scene where Obi Wan and the bounty hunter are fighting. That was nice.

I had a big problem with the scene when Anakin's mother dies and the scenes that follow up. So, Anakin finds his mother, she was severely tortured and wounded, she tries to tell him she loves him, but she's too weak and on the verge of death. Anakin tells her to stay with him. So far it's very emotional and effective. I'm really sad. Anakin is sad. She eventually dies, then the music gets louder, we see Anakin's face, he's very, very angry. I am also angry. We hear the lightsaber turn on, then he strikes down two sand people. Another sand person charges toward him and he strikes him down, too, it's very intense, and then... the tension dies down a bit. Then Yoda tells us about the anger and suffering Anakin is feeling. Um, ok. And then we see the massacre, right? Nope. We get a random scene from another plotpoint. WHAT THE FUCK?! That completely ruined all the build-up. It destroyed all the tension and the emotion. I can't believe  they did that. Why did they do that?  Then we get the scene with him coming back at the house carrying his mother's corpse. We see and feel his anger. Then there is the scene where he's talking with Padme. He cries because he believes it's his fault. He thinks that if he were stronger, he could have saved her. Again, it's effective and emotional. But I really wish we saw the massacre. And no, I'm not some psycho who wants to see sand children get murdered. But show us SOMETHING. At least show us how he's destroying their sand igloos with the Force push ability or something. Show us how Anakin reacts and how he unleashes his powers on the sand people. Shows us more than two fucking seconds. This paragraph was more of a rant than a review.

So we get about two action scenes in one hour and a half. That's pretty bad. Then we finally get an action scene at the droid factory. Then we get the epic action scene at the end with a lot of fighting. That was satisfying. Anakin dual-wielding lightsabers to fight count Dooku was very badass. And Anakin getting his arm cut was shocking. The internet had spoiled that scene for me (among many other), but I totally forgot about it. 

Episode II has a bit of a pacing issue. There's barely any action in the first half. And I really hated that they messed up the Anakin rampage scene. But other than that, I did feel emotion. As I said, the scenes were effective. I loved the huge action sequence at end. All in all, I think compared to Episode I, Episode II has higher and lower points, while Episode I is more consistent and moderate. Episode I was a more enjoyable experience for me."
"Jan 19, 2021",2.5,"Not that good, a lot of stupid scenes with Padme and Anakin, but the lightsaber battles were pretty cool."
"Jan 13, 2021",2,"Attack of the Clones suffers in almost every element you can think of. The writing is bad, the acting is just OK with Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee being the only notable ones, as well as a hard to watch love sequence that should go down as one of the worst in cinema history. Even as a kid, this was my least favorite of the trilogy, to the point where I could not even remember what the climax was. Episodes 1 and 3 are far better. This movie has some entertaining battles, but that's really all it has going for it. Grade 63% (D)"
"Jan 12, 2021",3.5,"Although this movie is riddled with bad dialogue and cringe scenes overall the story that this movie offers is great. It is a great build up of a relationship between Anakin and Padmé but even I couldn't stop cringing whenever them two had a scene together in the middle portion of the movie. However, the ending of this movie is amazing, it has a great battle filled with Star Wars magic and I felt like a little kid again watching it."
"Jan 12, 2021",1.5,Aged very very bad and has the worst Love story in cinema history
"Jan 11, 2021",3,"As opiniões dos fãs são mistas, contudo eu acho que é um filme bacana. Peca em trabalhar com arcos muito massantes e desnecessários para a trama. As batalhas e lutas com sabre de luz são o ponto mais alto do filme apesar de efeitos especiais muitas vezes questionáveis. Esse Episódio II não melhorou muito em relação ao primeiro mas consegue ainda se redimir com personagens legais (Obi-Wan, Conde Dookan) e a incrível batalha de Geonosis!"
"Jan 06, 2021",3,"Definitely better than Episode I... unfortunately, it's not by a big difference. It has some similarities with the previous film, actually. Most parts are boring, it is kind-of slow, the characters seem a little bit empty... However, I would say that this one is barely, BARELY fresh. It has some better moments than the other movie. I enjoyed the action sequences and the ending. I mean, not as good as other Star Wars films, but still, not completely horrible, it passed the time."
"Jan 01, 2021",2,"Definitely the worse movie in the prequel trilogy, boring, uninteresting, acting is mediocre, and very unbalanced when it comes to storytelling.

The lightsaber duels were the most interesting parts of the film, including the epic fight marking the beginning of the Clone Wars.

My grade: D+"
"Dec 31, 2020",3,"3 bags so when you think about it, this movie is kinda like an origin for the show ""The Mando."" So why is that show so much better? Here's the problem we realized with this movie: it gets better AFTER it has been boooooooring and it's tough to captivate the audience when you've given them a lame snooze fest and tried to get Portman to act like she was into Christensen, he's just not her type you see. Haven't you seen Thor? She likes dudes with muscles. H.C. was more of a mean and lean machine (piers for next movie)!!!!! Ya get it b/c Vader becomes part Robot and burns off tons of fat with the help of a volcano and Ewan McGregor choreography so yeah there ya go"
"Dec 30, 2020",1.5,The worst Star Wars movie to date
"Dec 28, 2020",2,This movie suffers from the same problems as the Phantom Menace. But additional action and some weighty scenes (although few and far between) make it superior to episode 1.
"Dec 27, 2020",3.5,"It has it's flaws, but it isn't as bad as most people say it is (I'm looking at you, mr plinkett) the action is cool and some of the sfx are decent. Yeah, the romance could've been better, but if you don't try to overanalyze this, you'll enjoy it."
"Dec 27, 2020",5,"I thought it was a great movie. 

Hayden nailed his part in such a complex character showing so many conflicting emotions and seeds of the dark side. The parts with Anakin's mother is so good. 

I also thought Hayden and Natalie had great chemistry all things considered and you really rooted for them. Any problems people had between Anakin and Padme was the dialogue which wasn't even that big of a deal. Ewan, as obi won, was awesome you get to see Jango Fett and boba fett and what led to the clone wars. Anakin's scenes with his mom are chilling showing his first steps in the dark side and Hayden performed that very well. I also thought the end battle was sick. The fights in Geonosis is literally breathtaking showing all the Jedi fighting together."
"Dec 26, 2020",5,After the pod racing the Clone Wars begin with tons of droids getting gunned or sliced with no end in sight. Amazing movie.
"Dec 25, 2020",2,"Always when I am watching SW, this is the Film I do not remember 😅"
"Dec 25, 2020",5,"This movie is a marvelous cog in a grand machine; the perfect build-up to the plan unraveling. The characters are dynamic, realistic, and all go together excellently, with stellar execution of the unfolding scheme in the background, and the internal pain of a protagonist in a confusing and harsh world. This movie is a true masterpiece, and few creations of any medium have surpassed its quality."
"Dec 24, 2020",4,"Very enjoyable Star Wars film. Some of the dialogue is a bit stilted at times but some great lines, enjoyable action scenes, and overall fun film you can watch again and again."
"Dec 22, 2020",2,"The greats are rarely as great as they are talked up to be and the bad are never usually as bad as expected, which was again the case for me here. I'm also definitely not a big Star Wars fan so my sensitivities are far less likely to be offended. This also wasnt good and definitely had trouble getting me to become fully absorbed and while I try to refrain from negativity, especially with regard to individuals, there was one performance I just really didn't care for here..."
"Dec 22, 2020",4,"A masterful symphony of love and loss, immense cosmic power and tragic human weakness. A sensational film that manages to be both tender and explosive. This movie simultaneously feels timeless and ahead of its time. The action is topped only by its depth of story. The world it creates feels both overwhelming and intimate. A flawless musical score decorates the most powerful forbidden romance in modern cinema as well as large scale battle and action. A spellbinding experience from start to finish."
"Dec 19, 2020",2.5,"Despite the cringeworthy attempt at romance, Attack of the Clones provides enough action and depth to surpass its predecessor in entertainment value. Whether that is a compliment or not is up for you to decide."
"Dec 18, 2020",1.5,"While I find Attack of the Clones to be the most boring Star Wars movie, I can't say that it is the absolute worst. The story and characters still don't make any sense whatsoever, but it at least feels a bit more stepped up with its ideas as a sequel than The Phantom Menace."
"Dec 17, 2020",3.5,"Was much better than the Phantom Menace and rewards fans who were attached to the classic characters.   Special effects were great,  but the romance dragged on the movie a bit."
"Dec 15, 2020",5,"Una gran historia de guerra y amor, con algunos planos detectivescos y misteriosos. Muy buena para los fans"
"Dec 09, 2020",3,"I'll start with a good. The movie does a great job setting the seeds for Anakin‘s fall towards evil. Some of the characters and worlds introduced are extremely creative and the arena portion was phenomenal. Count Dooku was a great villain and believably kicked the heroes butts. Here is what I think everyone disliked. The movie was extremely slow and some of the acting, or should I say dialogue, was too cheesy. The light saber duel at the end was poorly choreographed and edited, some parts just looked like actors waving around toys. Overall it was a decent middle to this trilogy with many parts that could have been much better."
"Dec 08, 2020",4.5,Under-appreciated movie with an excellent storyline
"Dec 07, 2020",2,"Achei as cenas entre o Luke e a Padmé bem desnecessárias e diria até vergonhosas, retira toda a atenção do resto dos acontecimentos. O filme é bem tosco."
"Dec 07, 2020",2,The lowest of the low for the prequel trilogy. Christensen's acting dragged what could have been a good movie down. The movie was more of a set up film than a solid film that happens to set up the conclusion of the trilogy.
"Dec 04, 2020",5,great film and much better than tlj
"Dec 03, 2020",2,"very forgettable film, for me it is as bad as its predecessor."
"Nov 28, 2020",1.5,"Probably the Worst Star Wars Movie. This movie gets so boring. With a cringe love story and already really dated CGI, this movie is a disaster beyond repair."
"Nov 28, 2020",3.5,"Fans: 'we were beginning to wonder if you had got our message?'
RickMcCallum: 'I retransmitted it just as you had all requested'.
George Lucas: 'Then I decided to make Episode II!'
The second prequel. 
It seems people either like or dislike this film and there is less a middle ground view to take with it when compared with Menace or Sith.
I like this film and I say that in view of the fact this was my first Star Wars film at the big screening 2002. Absolutely it has problems and it is not as good as any of the Star Wars, Empire or Sith but IMO it improves on Menace purely as a more well paced film with a number of brilliant set piece action scenes spaced well throughout the film very, and climaxing with the very well executed third act."
"Nov 25, 2020",2.5,"Another miss by George Lucas after the debacle that was The Phantom Menace. Once again the overuse of CGI, dreadful dialogue and average acting lead to a rough second movie of the Prequels"
"Nov 13, 2020",4,Such great cast and a great movie love this one 
"Nov 13, 2020",1,"Star Wars Attack of the Clones is the worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen. It's worse than The Last Jedi and I'd rather eat a rotten tomato than watch that. Good things first. Hayden does an amazing job as Anakin always has and always will. The opening is fun and energetic and Dexter Jetster love that man, Wanna buy some death sticks. Now onto the bad. Obi-Wan is stupid, clones made from a bounty hunter Dooku hired. NOTHING SEEMS WRONG THERE. The CGI mess of the droid factory, Yoda being a general. no no nononon. Hate it please burn."
"Nov 12, 2020",3.5,"As I've said with the Phantom Menace: amazing special effects, wicked battle scenes and some fantastic plot elements redeem the otherwise incredibly dull dialogue and intergalactic stupidity.

Plus, this was the beginning of Anakin's soap-oper-Imean, fall to the Dark Side, ahem.

There's a reason Hayden Christensen vanished off the face of the Earth faster than a fart in the wind."
"Nov 12, 2020",0.5,The sequel trilogy is way better 👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼🍼 there there prequel fans there there.
"Oct 31, 2020",3.5,"The 2nd installment in the prequels moves very slowly. All in all, this movie could arguably the worst of the prequels. It does one thing well, and that is advance the character of Anakin Skywalker. The ending to this movie is also insanely good, saving it from 2 stars or so. A must watch for any star wars fan, but casuals can read the cliff notes."
"Oct 26, 2020",5,Super underrated and awesome
"Oct 22, 2020",3.5,"Clone wars learned to a certain extent from its predecessor, emphasis on ‘to a certain extent'. You still got to appreciate George Lucas's ability think up awesome ideas like the clones."
"Oct 21, 2020",2,Boring. ATTACK OF THE CLONES focuses on all the wrong things.
"Oct 15, 2020",4,"One of my favorite ones, I don't know how this gets so much hate!  Almost non stop action, check, new bounty hunter, check, awesome worlds, check, super awesome chase scene, check, seeing Yoda fight for the first time and someone wield 2 lightsabers like in the video games, check!  LOVE THIS ONE"
"Oct 11, 2020",4.5,"This is a very flawed movie, but it makes the Star Wars galaxy so much larger and has some incredible moments, set pieces, and foreshadowing. Also, Yoda vs. Christopher Lee in a lightsaber fight? It's so awesome."
"Oct 11, 2020",3,"Attack of the Clones has many interesting scenes and a well-rounded and satisfying conclusion. Unfortunately, it still suffers from some of the issues of its predecessor movie with chunky dialogue, an underwhelming plot at times, and almost unnatural romance between the key relationship of Star Wars."
"Oct 10, 2020",2,"My brother is disappointed that I dislike it so much, but my opinion isn't influenced by others. The end fight scene is pretty fun, but the rest of the movie is just simply not good. Not only is it a letdown based on the original trilogy, but as a movie itself, it's just bad."
"Oct 07, 2020",1.5,"This is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever made, and has aged the worst. Terrible performances all the way around. The script must've been written by 18 year old Star Wars fans that listen to emo music."
"Oct 06, 2020",2.5,"Poor execution, overuse of CGI, and awful dialogue, but very rich in story and setting up future events."
"Oct 05, 2020",0.5,that is twash only memes
"Oct 01, 2020",4,"I thought it was amazing, absolutely great!!!!"
"Sep 28, 2020",2,"Muito fraco.

Dificilmente um filme me deixa com sono, mas esse aqui se esforçou e muito. Pra um filme com foto no publico infantil e adolescente, foca-se muito em assuntos políticos mal desenvolvidos, que são principalmente péssimas pois essas discussões muitas vezes integram personagens desinteressantes, o que torna o filme arrastado. O desenvolvimento do Anakin soou forçado e exagerado, assim como seu romance com a princesa. As cenas de ação padecem de criatividade - CGI atirando no nada não conta. As baralhas Jedi não foram de todo mal, mas não chamam tanta atenção quanto no filme anterior.

Enfim, cada vez mais Star Wars parece overrated.

"Sep 16, 2020",2,"Attack of the Clones' awkward plot mashes together puzzle pieces that simply do not fit, and the forbidden romantics' antics are so messy and poorly written that the characters are left lagging in a movie that does its best, but still falls flat on its face."
"Sep 15, 2020",2.5,Better than last movie but not great

"Sep 08, 2020",4.5,"If you pause the movie at any point, you can find meme content. If you pause the deleted scenes at any moment, you can also find meme content. This movie is a masterpiece not because it is better that the Disney Sequels, but because it will forever be in our hearts as the biggest Star Wars meme ever to show in theaters."
"Sep 04, 2020",0.5,"To be honest, what is there to say that hasn't already been said. This movie just fails at so many levels of filmmaking. It's not fun to watch, especially any scene with Anakin and Padme, the dialogue is terrible, the effects are pretty bad and it's incredibly boring. It also has the worst lightsaber fight in the entire series at the end. Many people will say that the Clone Wars TV show makes this movie better. I would disagree because it doesn't change any of the main problems with the movie. It just makes some things more understandable and gives more context to the events. If you want to watch it, go ahead, but temper your expectations accordingly."
"Sep 01, 2020",3.5,"I don't really care too much for the Anakin and Padme romance scenes (which are completely necessary but could've been done better), but I like the rest of it. Even if you hate the first two acts of the movie (which I don't), I think the third act is awesome enough to give the movie a positive review."
"Aug 31, 2020",3.5,Anakin take your hands off Padme.
"Aug 30, 2020",4.5,I will say this movie is a good star wars movie
"Aug 30, 2020",4.5,"Another action packed adventure. Hayden's performance is fine, he portrays anakin perfectly."
"Aug 29, 2020",3,Better than that new crap.
"Aug 26, 2020",3,"Just like ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"", I didn't mind this sequel, but the worst part of this movie was Anakin Skywalker because his acting was not very good in my opinion. This film does have some good effects."
"Aug 25, 2020",3.5,"After Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, this film represents a significant improvement in every department, from plot to character and even in computer-generated special effects."
"Aug 17, 2020",3,A hot mess filled with outrageous CGI.
"Aug 14, 2020",4,"Not a perfect movie by a long shot, but between it's entertaining action scenes, solid development for Anakin's path to the dark side, and Ewan as Kenobi: most of the problems with this movie fall to the wayside for me."
"Aug 11, 2020",2,"I mean, it's a tiny bit better than The Phantom Menace, but it still has all of the same problems. It still had terrible acting, directing, writing, and a messy and confusing plot. But this one also has the worst romance I have ever seen. George Lucas really does not know how to write romances. The only reason why I think that this is a slightly bit better than Episode I is because the plot is conveyed in a way that is easier to follow with than The Phantom Menace. And I also thought that the fight between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett was cool. But other that that, this movie did not even try to be better than Episode I. It's just as boring and just as bad."
"Aug 05, 2020",3,"I think I liked this less upon a second viewing than I did when I first saw Attack of the Clones.  There is lots of visual eye candy here, fairly decent action scenes.  The film is a set up of what we all know has to happen to Darth Vadar, and some of the build up and introduction of characters is interesting (Death Star plans, Owen and Beru, the Fetts, etc).  
But this film has two really fatal flaws:
1) The execution of the plot is garbage.  I see what they were going for - a manufactured false flag rebellion to gin up support for a power grab.  THAT part is actually interesting and prescient.  But the implementation is just junk, with random characters appearing and disappearing and not seeming to know what side they are on.  Even the Jedi council seems completely clueless as to what is going on.  They would rather train small children to stand in tight groups, blindfolded while holding activated light sabers while sending Anikan - the most promising Jedi ever who would bring balance to the Force - on some solo suicide mission.  These guys are NOT good mentors.
2) Padme and Anikan - the romance is painfully cringy to watch.  I felt really bad for Natalie Portman here.  It isn't just that Christensen can't act - and he cannot - but both of them are spoon fed the most horrendous dialogue of all time outside of, and possibly including, porn.  When Portman delivers the line about 'I truly love you', I was like, 'oh no, don't do it Patty Hearst'.  Again, there is nothing wrong with the outline - it is a valuable plot point that has to happen... but it could have been done in SO MUCH less ham-fisted of a manner.

Still, better than 'Last Jedi'."
"Jul 25, 2020",3,"I would have given at least one extra star if it wasn't for the creepy, awkward and painful Annika  in love storyline."
"Jul 23, 2020",0.5,🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤 Garbage HATE HATE HATE
"Jul 22, 2020",2,"More boring and flat than Phantom Menace but has great action that fans can forgive it for.  Ewan McGregor also rises to the occasion, whilst Hayden Christensen is let down by the script."
"Jul 21, 2020",2,"To all the prequel apologists who say the sequel trilogy is the worst thing to happen to Star Wars, please, watch this movie again.  Just TRY to watch this again and tell me any other entry in the main saga didn't at least do SOMETHING better.  Okay look, I spent years hating this movie and building up that loathing, and watching it again…yeah, it's earned.  But there are things in it that are okay, and better than I remember.  Obi Wan's investigating is a little more interesting, even if it all feels like vague set up for the inevitable TV show.  Jango Fett is still cool, if not a little underutilized.  I'll even make a modest defense for some of Anakin's moments of turning, like the bit with the Tusken Raiders that's actually more well put together than I remember.  But overall, yeah, it's a mess.  It all feels like exposition and set up for future entries rather than its own thing, and it just makes the movie kind of boring.  When we do have action scenes, they're okay, but just okay.  Some of the action pieces actually feel like they go on forever.  Maybe they're making up for all the talking, but when stuff does go down, it's fun for a little while but gets boring fast.  And then there's Anakin and Padme.  God damn it do I hate Anakin and Padme!  Padme's actually a more competent character than I remember her being, and I like seeing her hold her own in the action set pieces.  That just makes it even more annoying when she falls head over heels for the angst king himself Anakin.  Hayden Christensen is not a good actor.  Even when I've seen him in good movies, he's awful, I don't like him.  A large chunk of this movie is just Anakin whining and complaining that things ""aren't fair"" in Christensen's dull monotone, and then aggressively cringey romantic scenes with him and Padme.  It's a tough sit for most of this movie.  There are glimmers of that Star Wars fun here and there.  Seeing a bunch of Jedi at the end is cool, the worlds are unique, and Ewan McGregor is always good.  But if I never see this one again, I'll be fine."
"Jul 20, 2020",2,When was Star Wars ever this obsessed with romance. Half the movie is Padme and Anakin getting married and running away. Then Anakin is a ball full of drama. Ahh... Revenge. Ahh... So Sad. It misses the key components that episodes 3-6 had.
"Jul 19, 2020",4,I love this movie. Great epic and very nice soundtrack. Clones!
"Jul 16, 2020",3.5,"compelling characters?  Check 
Story you care to know progressing? Check
Interesting and new places to see and things to do?  Check and check. 
So why am I gonna come crashing down on movie 2?     Well....     remember when Anakin was praised by Ben Kenobi as being a great star pilot and a cunning warrior?      Ya.... losing an arm apparently is synonymous with unlocking your true potential as a learned Jedi.       That or a gateway to getting tossed out an open window.... sorry Mace Windu.... but in this movie he's needing saving more than doing the saving.... it's okay though.    The clone wars series will fix all that.    It was a decent movie.  Not great again but heck.... it set us up for episode 3 and it's what it needed to be."
"Jul 16, 2020",2,It was not as good as I thought I didn't really like Obi-wan's hair
"Jul 16, 2020",2,"A step up from it's predecessor, but still a boring and shallow entry to the Star Wars saga. Passes time if you're bored. That's about it."
"Jul 15, 2020",3,"This was George Lucas's attempt to create more of what he did in Episode I. Despite the film being better, it still felt a little flat. The story went deeper. Anakin Skywalker seemed very selfish and whiny. Those performances and scenes killed it. Maybe this was the director and the script's fault. The best part of the film is honestly all the scenes with Ewan McGregor, as the soundtrack is a much-improved special from John Williams. As for all Star War's soundtracks are lovable."
"Jul 13, 2020",3,"Much better than the first of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, but definitely not the saga at it's best."
"Jul 13, 2020",1,A lot of the movie and its characters ranged from boring to cringe inducing. The ending was fine but that's the only part I somewhat liked about this movie.
"Jul 09, 2020",3,"Este filme apuesta por mejorar sus efectos especiales, pero lamentablemente no lo consigue. Apartando ese ámbito, la actuación de Hayden y la trama fueron buenas, pero no excelentes.
Todo lo dicho anteriormente, se perfecciona en la continuación -y cierre- de la saga."
"Jul 06, 2020",3.5,"I use to not like this movie, but I saw again and grew a bigger respect for it. The action scenes in this movie are outstanding, and George Lucas brings more new and interesting characters. I love how politics are involved in this film. While Padme and Anakin's scene can be somewhat hard to sit through, The Attack of the Clones is an improvement to The Phantom Menace."
"Jul 06, 2020",4,Better than they say; essential for setting up Anakin's fall and it is beautifully crafted.
"Jul 05, 2020",2,"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones is a new low for the franchise and, despite a pretty good final fight, has bland action and terrible CGI which has not aged well at all. The relationship between Anakin and Padame feels extremely odd and all the other characters feel unnecessary, boring or annoying. There's less Jar Jar Binks which is a bonus but overall, a terrible sequel to an already bad start for this prequel trilogy,"
"Jul 01, 2020",2,A little bit better than Episode one but its story is weak and dialog ridiculous.
"Jun 27, 2020",0.5,I gave this movie half a star because it is another movie in the series of letdowns with horrible acting barely any action scenes it surprises me that little kids like this movie considering that all it is is dumb politics
"Jun 26, 2020",2,It passed the time is the best thing I can say about this movie
"Jun 20, 2020",4,"Attack of the Clones is in many ways on part with The Phantom Menace. It continues the feeling of the prequels in the form of world building and cinematography. Attack serves as a good groundwork for my favorite TV-show ""The Clone Wars"". Still this movie has some of the worst dialogue in the whole franchise, especially the Anakin &amp; Padme love relationship. If you look away from the godawful dialogue you can see the amazing story that George always wanted to tell."
"Jun 20, 2020",3,"I didn't mind this sequel, but the worst part of this movie was Anakin Skywalker because his acting was not very good."
"Jun 18, 2020",3,"Not a fan of the forced and uncomfortable romance and dialogue between Anakin and Padme, but Natalie Portman did a great job with what was given to her in terms of the script. 
I really enjoyed the third act of this movie with the showdown between Jedi, clones and droids. It was also great to see Yoda swing a lightsaber around in his prime.
This was the movie in which C3PO was the most unbearable and annoying. A lot of what happened to him in the droid factory and what he said there was comically bad and over the top.
Overall enjoyed the movie in spite of some glaring issues."
"Jun 16, 2020",3.5,"Episode II Attack of the Clones of Lucas's prequel trilogy gets a lot of heat some of which I think is overblown. People like to jump on the hate bandwagon for this flick. It had a captivating premise, Anakin is around the age of 19 in the story, has become a jedi apprentice and is tasked with providing protection for the beautiful young senator (former queen) Padme Amidala from bounty hunters hired by a separatist movement. The separatist movement is led by an enigmatic sith lord, Darth Sidious and his apprentice Count Dooku, a former Jedi. They are rebelling against the republic for something political involving trade. While Anakin is escorting Padme to naboo, the two fall for one another despite the illicit nature of their affair; Jedi are forbidden to love. Some of the dialogue is a little hokey and on the nose, but for the most part the subplot is serviceable. Melodramatic scenes resembling something on skinemax are thrown into the equation which don't sweeten the deal.
As far as spectacle is concerned, the visuals and computer generated imagery is very good for the year the movie was produced, and the action scenes dazzle. The character of Anakin is well-developed, and his slow progression towards the dark side is explored well while still remaining a sympathetic character."
"Jun 14, 2020",3.5,"I'm rewriting this review after re-watching Attack of the Clones. On rewatch, Attack of the Clones is an at first boring forced love story with no real plot, but as you get into the middle, the movie picks up in action and emotion. Anakin holding his dying mother in his arms is one of the most powerful scenes in the entire saga, and the Battle of Geonosis (as well as the arena scene) are also some of my favorite moments in the series. I will mention this, though. If you watch the Clone Wars TV series, you may respect and enjoy this movie a lot more than you would originally. If you look past the bad dialogue and forced love story, this movie is generally pretty good."
"Jun 11, 2020",2.5,"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Review: 5.5/10

Pros:

Better pacing than Ep. 1

Anakin/Obi-Wan have good chemistry on screen

Some intense action sequences, a great central mystery

Cons:

The dialogue sucks a lot of the time

Movie still gets REALLY boring in parts"
"Jun 11, 2020",2,"Well, this film is better than the phantom menace, I'll give it that, but the dialogue is still terrible (""I don't like sand"" - uhh what?), the plot is still awful for a film directed at children, but the battle at the end makes up for it - I remember being a kid and thinking that was awesome. Sadly, the rest of it is boring and dry. Young Boba Fest is disappointing - how can the coolest Star Wars character ever have once been an annoying child. Count Dooku is not needed - they should have kept Darth Maul in to replace him (yes, I know he is technically still alive from the clone wars). It is more interesting though, if you take out most of the stuff with Padme and Anakin and kept in more stuff about Obi Wan and Jango Fett. C3PO and R2D2 were thrown in for no reason, but they were better comic relief than Jaja Binks, so I don't mind. In conclusion, it is a bit boring, but better than the last."
"Jun 08, 2020",4.5,"One of my very few ""problems"" with the previous Star Wars films in George Lucas' now-iconic franchise consisted of really just not being that into general SW lore nearly as much as I fear Lucas might've intended. Now I know a lot of people seem to hate Attack of the Clones and its fun-poking fictitious mythology, but for me it gave the intrigue of SW characters literally a rerun, and a wholly successful one at that."
"Jun 07, 2020",2,I think Phantom Menace is slightly better than Attack of the clones only because of Darth Maul. There is no Darth Maul in this movie. But there is a big battle with Jedi and Droids and that is fun but you have to sit through an awful love story and Obi Wan's investigation to finally get that fight. And all of the Phantom Menace and it's just boring. And the acting isn't much better in this movie either.
"Jun 05, 2020",3,"This Star Wars movie was very exciting but... it doesn't live up to the newer Star Wars movies. This is an epic/adventure movie. Near the end of the movie, it haves an epic battle scenes. Plenty of  sci-fi action throughout the movie and some disturbing violence(not that bad). This movie is better than the first movie... for sure! I give this 70% Rotten Tomatoes!"
"Jun 05, 2020",4,"Honestly it aged kinda well, and ITS Not that bad"
"Jun 03, 2020",4,"Even though I enjoyed Phantom more than this, this is a step up from Phantom. The actors are more comfortable with their roles and the CGI is improved. The overall story in interesting, with once again some of the best scenes in Star Wars history, though most are forgettable compared to scenes in other Star Wars films. Some of the dialogue is out of place and it's overall a mediocre film, but the lore and overall story make it worth a look."
"Jun 03, 2020",4,"This movie was slightly better than the predecessor, but it also isn't very great. I am a huge Star Wars fan and i still can't say that all of the movies are awesome. The worst part about this one is probably the romance between Padme and Anakin. Their connection in the first movie felt like a mother-son, or a big sister-young brother connection. They wanted to make us believe that they had this relationship. It was weird, creepy, cringey and uncomfortable. The rest of it was fine. The plot where Obi-Wan tries to find out who tried to kill Padme was kind of uninteresting. What saves this from being worse than Episode I, is the fact that the fight on Geonosis was brilliant. Every shot of it."
"Jun 02, 2020",1,"The film is horrible, a boring political plot, in addition to working on the relationship between Anakin and Padmé in a tedious and tiring way."
"Jun 01, 2020",5,10x better then the ST
"May 31, 2020",2,It's too long with a loveless  bland love story and some bad dialogue but the action scenes and the movies score makes those seen more bearable.
"May 30, 2020",4.5,the romance is very bad but the rest is actually really good
"May 29, 2020",1.5,"As a life-long Star Wars fan, ugh."
"May 28, 2020",4,"Although the film could have benefitted from one more touch-up of the screenplay before shooting — tightening up  the dialogue, a little more context at times to some of the more complex plot points — this is a fun, exciting film which tells a pretty compelling story of political intrigue. Definitely, the most detective noir of the Star Wars films — which is a unique detour for the film saga. Ewan McGregor brings Obi-Wan Kenobi to life and carries the film on his back among the cast. At times, some of the details of the plot become a little convoluted and the banter between Anakin and Padme needs a re-write, but overall a fun fantasy adventure that lays the groundwork for a very compelling conclusion."
"May 26, 2020",5,"I just watched this movie for the first time in a while and can say sincerely that it stands the test of time as a top notch sci fi.   With the luxury of knowing how the most recent trilogy finishes, it's a wonder that Lucas was so vilified.  A complex story and a clunky romance don't detract from the ultimate goal of expanding the Star Wars mythology and entertaining with light saber laden action.  Jango Fett's decapitation was the clincher.  Critics be damned!!"
"May 25, 2020",4,"Like The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones gets way too much hate. It has great CGI, and some really exciting sequences. It also shows Anakin slowly turning to the Dark Side in some scenes, making the transition more complete for when he fully turns. Although the lightsaber fight at the end is a bit underwhelming compared to other duels, it still holds up well. And of course, who can forget the orgasmic sounds of the seismic charges!"
"May 24, 2020",1.5,This movie is somehow even worse than the Phantom Menace.
"May 23, 2020",0.5,I watched about 20 minutes of the worthless video game. It makes no sense and if you can sit through it good luck!
"May 20, 2020",5,"I like better the phantom menace than the attack of the clones. But both are good, better than marvel movies at least."
"May 20, 2020",5,"PERFECT start to the Clone Wars, WW1 of the Star Wars universe. The cringe on Padmé's and Anakin's love is understandable, as both have the love experience of a 5-year-old, and the Battle of Geonosis is incredible. CGI doesn't overload, a masterpiece, 10/10."
"May 20, 2020",4,"While the acting is more stilted and awkward than the rest of the franchise or most films, its underlying plot of Obi-Wan tracking down the source of the assassination plot of Padme and the machinations of the insidious Palpatine's plot to destroy the Jedi is becoming more fruitful by the moment."
"May 19, 2020",2.5,"Not awful but not great either. Obviously Ewan McGregor is great as usual, Padmé's costumes are brilliantly designed and varied and the new planets and sets in this movie are really creative and have brilliant colors and we get to see different parts of planets we've already seen and that's what I love about the prequels with its incredible worldbuilding. There's also amazing action in this film in the 1st and 3rd act that makes great use of the envrionment and we see new weapons and the whole concept of Obi-Wan setting out to find the spy thay's trying to kill Padmé is intriguing and exciting and there are good emotional beats with Anakin finding his mother dead and of course, John Williams delivers another stunning score. 

However, this film is drenched with CGI in pretty much every frame making the movie look fake, oversaturadely bright and looks like a video game, which is quite disturbung and this film is infamously known for its awful romantic scenes with cringey and awkward dialogue that give me a lot of Shakespeare vibes and not in a good way and Hayden and Natalie's bland and wooden performances with no chemistry don't help either. This movie is also really boring in the 2nd act, mainly focusing on the cringey romance with Anakin and Padmé, it lacks a clear central storyline and Jango and Dooku were quite wasted as villains, Jango especially. It's not an awful movie however and I'd watch this over TLJ any day"
"May 19, 2020",1.5,"If approach this as just a movie this is one star. The acting is stilted, the lines are dry, and the CGI makes me nauseous. However if you look at this as a Star Wars fan it’s better because of some of the character and what it implies and begins."
"May 17, 2020",3.5,"I like this movie. Although the acting and dialogue are rough, the last 45 minutes of the film is very entertaining. Definitely an underrated movie."
"May 17, 2020",1.5,"Attack Of The Clones has to be the worst Star Wars movie in my opinion, the movie's plot is too hard to keep up with and the cast aren't as good as they were from before. The only character I think which is enjoyable throughout this movie is Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) he's got some memorable quotes but not as memorable as this movie. The fight scenes aren't really that fun and engaging as they've previously been in the other Star Wars Movie's and the only fight scene which sort of felt fun was near the end with Yoda and Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) but apart from that there isn't that much I enjoyed about this movie and the only things I sort of enjoyed about this movie would have to be about Anakins mother and some of scenes with Dex in and he's hardly in it lol. Finally, the dialogue with Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) can be seen as quite cringey throughout this movie and it's not his fault, it's the direction which George Lucas wanted this movie to be in. Overall, it's not my favourite Star Wars movie, far from it.


Also, I forgot to mention, why did they reuse the duel of fates theme when Anakin is going to slay a bunch of Tusken Raiders, it doesn't really work that well."
"May 17, 2020",3,"Ah yes, the film that made the fans think Anakin Skywalker is a complete fool. Not to mention that line ""I don't like sand."" What did the sand ever do to him? I really think this film was just a plain story. The only thing I really enjoyed was of course the Yoda and Count Dooku fight, and the Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jango Fett fight. It was really nice to see young Boba Fett looking up to his father as a big role model. And getting to see the legend Samuel L Jackson (Mace Windu) with a lightsaber in action was also a little treat for us!"
"May 17, 2020",2.5,"Clearly a miss-step, over the top cgi doesn't help with a bland-generic warzone plot."
"May 17, 2020",1,As a kid I loved this movie and would give it a 4/5 or 5/5 but now that I'm older I couldn't finish it. Maybe I've watched it so much its boring now but I ended up stopping halfway through and watching home alone instead. Battle of genosis is the only decent scene that scene is a 3/5 but rest of the movie is 1/5
"May 14, 2020",3,"Despite the awkward love story unfolding throughout the movie and the somewhat pointless interactions in some parts, it does a great job setting up greatly important events both for the next movie and in the Clone Wars series. Anakin's fall, the Clone Army, and Palpatine's rise to power."
"May 10, 2020",0.5,This movie should never have been made. It's Lucas's Plan 9 from Outer Space.
"May 09, 2020",3.5,it's not that bad to be honest. palpatine setting up anikan with padme. this is the story of how one man created the empire right under the jedi's nose
"May 07, 2020",1.5,the worst of all the prequals. YES it is. Only good part is Obi-Wan fighting against Jango Fett. I can't even stand Anakin and Padme in this film. They are terrible at making me believe that they are in love. The end fight scenes are even lame. All them jedi couldn't storm Count Dooku. Come on. Feel free to sleep during this one.
"May 07, 2020",3,"Me gustó mucho más que el episodio 1, el arco de Obi-Wan y Jango Fett es buenisimo.
Lo que falla en esta pelicula son algunos dialogos y algunas escenas romanticas en Naboo. Anakin es odioso 3/4 de pelicula, el personaje de Padme muy bueno. La pelicula termina cerrando muy muy bien con la batalla en Geonosis y el duelo entre Obi-Wan y Anakin vs Conde Dooku."
"May 06, 2020",3.5,Better than the last one 
"May 06, 2020",3.5,"It was a much needed improvement from the previous installment (Episode I). Although slow at the beginning, it excites you with many tidbits of action through-out the film. Dialogue and romance was lack-luster but not as horrible as some would suggest. Overall, not a bad film whatsover."
"May 05, 2020",3,"Better than Phantom Menace, But is that really the bar? Bland special effects carry a film with laughable dialogue."
"May 05, 2020",5,This is my favorite one out of the whole franchise and I don't care what anybody tells me. I loved this movie from beginning to end. From the fight scenes to the casual dialogue this movie gets it done.
"May 05, 2020",3,"You have to hand it to George Lucas, he listened to fans' criticisms of episode 1, and really toned down the amount of screen time Jar Jar Binks received in its follow-up, playing only a minor supporting role (albeit one with a great deal of relevance to the narrative). Now that's out of the way, I can start by saying that Attack of the Clones is a definite step up in quality from its immediate predecessor, in spite of the comparatively exorbitant CGI budget clearly set aside, this is probably the Star Wars film with the least amount of practical effects in favour of more computer generated ones. That said though, it really expanded the whole universe even further, introducing more new races, new planets &amp; systems, and a menacing new villain in Count Dooku, expertly portrayed by the late, great Christopher Lee. The pacing of this film is far better than Phantom Menace in many ways as well, and additionally we are treated to further tie-ins to the original trilogy. And truly the pièce de résistance is the action set pieces we are treated to, not only do we have more Jedi knights than ever, altogether as well as in one place, but probably the fight that, more than any other, made 12 year old me grin from ear to ear like an idiot for the duration, in getting to see Yoda finally show off his sabre skills. That fight between Yoda and Dooku is one of those moments in cinema that I will always remember, because it was so out of left field to see the usually stoic and slow-moving Jedi master show everyone else up! Now the big, glaring downside to this film, which is the writing, proving that Jonathan Hales should never write another script for the rest of his career, because my GOD some of the dialogue in this film is dreadful! Not only that, but the on-screen romance between Anakin and Padme is one of the worst in film history, the poor dialogue aside, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman (improved as she may have been) just aren't convincing as a couple, the former in particular coming across as whiny, as well as a bit creepy in his pursuit of Padme. So this film has a lot of the positives of Phantom Menace, as well as a lot of the same problems, poor writing and not particularly thrilling acting performances by the primary cast."
"May 04, 2020",2,A hilariously bad and stupid but entertaining movie. My least favorite Star Wars film.
"May 03, 2020",3.5,"Much better than the first movie! The acting has gone up a notch as well as the quality in general. The writing is a bit rocky though. The way Anakin and Padme ""flirt"" is really them just saying they're in agony being near each other, which isn't what I would want to hear from the man I like."
"May 02, 2020",3.5,Its one of the worst in the series but still good
"May 02, 2020",3.5,"I think I've come to the realization that this film is the low point in the Star Wars series for me. Anakin is creepy, the dialogue is cheesy and it's just WAY longer than it needs to be. Again, it's entertaining enough, but there's just too much fodder for criticism and jokes."
"Apr 30, 2020",4,A great middle to the prequels that could be better without the clingy love dialogue.
"Apr 29, 2020",5,"It is often hated for it‘s poor dialogue. But where others see bad, I try to see good. The love story between Anakin and Padmé has a very Shakespearean feel to it, which is a nice back-to-the-roots attempt at Star Wars. Not the best of the saga, but a good film for sure."
"Apr 25, 2020",2.5,"A potentially fun but unfortunately boring, un engaging, and easily missable installment in the Star Wars story."
"Apr 21, 2020",3.5,"Una película odiada profundamente por los fans de Star Wars, aunque por el transcurso de los años ha tenido un poco más de cariño hacia los espectadores. Algo que resalta esta película, y las precuelas son sus ideas en general bien ejecutados, pero otros no, el romance es algo tedioso en partes, sus efectos visuales envejecieron un poco mal en algunas escenas, los diálogos tienen sus pros y contras, el guión mejora con el transcurso de la historia, los personajes en su mayoria estan bien desarrollados sabiendo su importancia en la trama, la misión de obi wan para encontrar el planeta ""perdido"", Kamino, está muy bien logrado y es algo esencial en la historia. Las escenas bélicas son magnificas, como la pelea en el coliseo, el personaje de Conde Dooku interpretado por Christopher Lee, es uno de los puntos más altos de la película, su actuación es digna de recordar, la banda sonora se supera cada vez más, el final cumple con creces, dando así el casamiento secreto de Anakin y Padme, y el inicio de la guerra de los clones.
Calificación: 6,8/10"
"Apr 19, 2020",2.5,"Horrible, but can manage watching it at least, compared to episode I."
"Apr 17, 2020",4,"Although I always think the acting of Anakin is a little overdone, the movie was amazingly done. The fight scene between Anakin and Obi-wan is the best in the entire series."
"Apr 17, 2020",4,"This was so much better than Phantom Menace. We see how Anaking grows up in the path of becoming a Jedi. Ewan Mc Gregor is great as Obi Wan Kenobi. Some people did not like the love part, but it was OK to me!"
"Apr 17, 2020",1.5,"A low point in the Star Wars saga, but the final act is still quite entertaining"
"Apr 16, 2020",2.5,Movie is wack but without it clone wars the show wouldn’t have happened 
"Apr 16, 2020",1,the main reason for this movie is for its visuals and a story that could have been a lot better
"Apr 10, 2020",2,Quase tão ruim quanto seu antecessor
"Apr 08, 2020",3.5,Is the dialogue cringeworthy? Sure. Is the acting a little off sometimes? Possibly. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it better than The Last Jedi? Without question.
"Apr 08, 2020",3.5,7.7/10 No secret. The weakest of the bunch. 
"Apr 07, 2020",1.5,My least favorite of the prequels. Even the effects were bad.
"Apr 06, 2020",3.5,"Oh, Attack.  What to do with you.  I despised the prequels utterly when they came out.  I've watched the Plinkett reviews repeatedly. But between time, having children, and rewatching everything in order, the way Lucas envisioned: I am a convert.  I love the prequels and the world building they added to the OT (perhaps having so much of it torn down thanks to the Disney fanon caused me and so many to appreciate Lucas' vision)

That said, Attack of the Clones is still the least of the three. Poignant emotional moments (Shmi's death/Anakin's wrath, Padme's admission of love, WAR!) are regularly undercut by janky CGI, WAY too much cornball even for SW (a 50s diner? Waddyaknow?) and a sense of events cascading rather than being driven by actions. I love it, but it's handily my least favorite of the 6 Lucas entries."
"Apr 01, 2020",2,"The weakest movie in the Star Wars franchise. The subplot of Anakin and Padme is one of the most forced relationships in any movie, period. They fell in love because George Lucas said so. Also, why was Anakin so whiny? Why did Padme become a Senator? So many questions and not enough interest to have them answered. On to 'Revenge of the Sith.'"
"Mar 26, 2020",2.5,"This Star Wars prequel was alright. I used to own it but not anymore. Hayden Christianson, Natalie Portman, and Ewan McGregor did a decent job in this movie. The plot to the movie was ok, but it should've been better. The special effects were pretty cool in the movie. That's the only good thing I'll say about this movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's not worth it."
"Mar 25, 2020",5,"This has always been my favorite Star Wars movie and even after 15 years, it still doesn't fail to enthrall me. The music is fantastic, the story, background, and special effects are fantastic, and the love is legendary."
"Mar 25, 2020",4.5,This movie is really good. I really love this movie. I really like the romance in this movie. I know some will disagree. I gotta say that this movie has really good action in it.
"Mar 24, 2020",3.5,Better than Clone Wars
"Mar 23, 2020",4,muy chula me ha gustado mucho
"Mar 22, 2020",3,"Attack of the Clones improves on the previous movie with epic CGI action and an engaging story, despite an underwhelming romantic subplot and iffy dialogue."
"Mar 21, 2020",1.5,"Dull and lifeless, realizes the worst part about Prequel trilogy - how unlikable Anakin is..."
"Mar 19, 2020",2,The cringe is strong in this one. 63%.
"Mar 18, 2020",3.5,"Attack of the Clones feels like another unnecessary addition to the Star Wars franchise, but at least it was better then the Phantom Menace."
"Mar 18, 2020",3.5,This movie is not as bad as people say
"Mar 16, 2020",4.5,It was not bad. I kind of liked it. Definitely recommend watching to know the full story about Star Wars.
"Mar 15, 2020",2.5,"not bad, dialogue is very wooden though"
"Mar 12, 2020",3,"It was entertaining and was the perfect action film. However, the dialogue and cinematography was very wonky. Nevertheless it's not as bad as everyone says."
"Mar 12, 2020",3,"Ok ... so if you watch this movie as an overall story ... its good. But scene to scene this has to be the worst star wars movie. Terrible dialogue, bad acting, poorly aged cgi effects, that diner scene is so weird as well.  Its still fun to watch but its suffers as a movie"
"Mar 12, 2020",1,"Didn't even make up for the first episode of the prequel trilogy, it just made it even worse to watch. Can George Lucas write Dialogue, like, at all?"
"Mar 11, 2020",5,"This movie is so good because the quality of the film and the space and the ships are very realistic. There is a part in the movie that they fight and this fight is amazing!!!!  
    I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!"
"Mar 10, 2020",3,"it's a meh movie with OMFG bad acting and horrifically bad romance with eh action and meh plot. Overall, It's pretty darn meh. 6/10 a fat C-.  3 year-olds will love it."
"Mar 09, 2020",5,Who doesn't like Attack of the clones. Very great movie for a single mom like me with 12 devilish children. My evil kids said there should have been more clones but I say more sand.
"Mar 08, 2020",3.5,The sequels made it look better.
"Mar 08, 2020",4,This movie isn't perfect but it's a fine enough addition to the Star Wars story. The prequels get too much hate. Some of the dialogue could be better. And the movie doesn't stand out too much in its own way. It's really just a bridge from Episode 1 to 3. But it's engaging and well done.
"Mar 04, 2020",2.5,"Dull, cheesy, and unsure of what it's trying to be. It's like a daytime soap opera based in space for the first 2 hours and even then some of the dialogue wouldn't have survived the cutting room floor. Redeemed slightly by the final battle scenes which are pretty good, but until The Last Jedi destroyed the franchise this film was comfortably the worst."
"Mar 04, 2020",3.5,"Old-school fans weren't going to be pleased regardless of what followed up The Phantom Menace, but Attack of the Clones stands worlds apart from its predecessor with action and effects as good as any produced at the time. (3.5/5)"
"Mar 03, 2020",0.5,yeah we get it Anakin you don't like sand
"Mar 02, 2020",0.5,Bored and disturbed by the awful script portrait of love
"Feb 28, 2020",3.5,"Pretty good, just dosen't live up to the other movies."
"Feb 27, 2020",3.5,"Worst writing of the bunch, but not the worst or the best."
"Feb 24, 2020",0.5,WOWWWW!!!!!!!!! CAME OUT OF THE THEATRE CLAPPING amazing lovely i love anikan and padme's romance about the sand too AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 22, 2020",3.5,"Attack of The Clones has some very good parts, I felt that the entire third act of the film was amazing and action packed. But everything else in this film is hard to watch, especially the excessive CGI and weak romance scenes."
"Feb 20, 2020",1,"If it wasn't for Phantom Menace, this would easily be the worst Star Wars movie out of the original 6. Don't get me started on the new ones.

The story drags on too slow. Too much time is dedicated to discussing politics and setting up a scene for a final CGI eyesore-fest. Anakin comes off as a cringey creeper who lusts for a woman more than twice his age. Mommy issues, anyone?

1/5. 1 full star for action, clean ""feel,"" and is better than Phantom Menace. That doesn't mean that this movie is good by any means. Don't be surprised if you fall asleep during a showing of this."
"Feb 19, 2020",1,"With it's hit or miss visuals, bafling dialogue, wierd choreogrophy, and atrocious acting. Episode 2 is the undesputable worst star wars movie"
"Feb 19, 2020",0.5,"FUCK THIS SHITTY ASS MOVIE, I'M OUT!"
"Feb 18, 2020",4,This was a good movie while you feel like you have to get to know Anakin again and you do quickly see how is easily subdued by love and Padme.  We get to see where Anakin powers are at and how the Clone army is created and which brings some fun fight scenes with Obi-wan and Jango Fett.  The fight scenes at the end finally bring in that Jedi chaos that we have been waiting for with a host of Jedi fighting side by side.  And in the end we get to see our favorite Master Jedi Yoda show of some skills of his own.  This definitely better than Episode One but still not reaching the level of the Original trilogy.
"Feb 18, 2020",4,"It has flaws,but it's better than 8 or 9"
"Feb 16, 2020",3.5,"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones follows up The Phantom Menace by giving us a film that although suffers from some poor CGI, has a masterclass of a cast with Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christiansen and Christopher Lee who all play their characters brilliantly and have great chemistry with each other. The satisfactory-constructed plot has some awesome battle scenes and introduces some intriguing new characters. Although at times the film can feel a bit slow and suffers from poor and unnecessary CGI, George Lucas yet again delivers another fun film to add to the Skywalker Saga."
"Feb 16, 2020",3,"In many ways this movie is more entertaining than its predecessor, but the romantic dialogue between Anakin and Padme is unbearable."
"Feb 14, 2020",2,"This movie is just as cheesy as the previous one, but it can't even manage to be be fun for half the run-time.  The whole middle act drags.  But hey, it's Star Wars."
"Feb 13, 2020",2,"My least favourite Star Wars movie excluding the holiday special, the clone wars and the ewok movies.Bad writing, cringeworthy romance, boring politics, Anakin is so whiny, bad acting, Count Dooku is a useless villain and not even the action scenes are good."
"Feb 11, 2020",1,This movie fails at everything it set out to do. The effects didn't age well and now look like a cheap knock-off. The pacing is inconsistent. The writing is clunky. The action scenes are clumsily staged. The acting doesn't deserve to be called acting. Even the hair and makeup made me cringe. I try to challenge myself to have one good thing to say about a bad film but there's nothing here. There is no redeemable quality to be found.
"Feb 09, 2020",1,"I think it is pretty obvious (cough ""I hate sand"" cough)."
"Feb 08, 2020",0.5,"The worst Star Wars movie, not only it is not interesting, it's really awkward and cheesy."
"Feb 07, 2020",4,Full of action and a great sequel!
"Feb 07, 2020",3.5,Story was good enough for me to enjoy. Acting was sub par. Outshined by original trilogy
"Feb 06, 2020",4,"Very underrated film, I am one of the few that enjoy the prequels for what they really are, good films. Yes parts are slow and boring, but the same can be said for the originals. Is the love story really that bad guys, it gives us death vader, I am glad they added the romance."
"Feb 05, 2020",3,Attack of the Clone is an OK film with a pretty good popcorn value.
"Feb 02, 2020",2.5,"Still not a good movie, but the Yoda scene alone is worth the price of admission"
"Feb 02, 2020",5,"As a die-hard Star Wars fan (even of these prequels) I love this. I will admit, that the romance scenes can be rougher than sand, and some of the effect may seem dated, but honestly, I just don't care. The film has much to offer, such as the engaging atmosphere of Coruscant, Obi Wan's detective pursuit of Jango Fett, and the action of the third act. It deserves a chance from every moviegoer, simply because of its scale, though many will likely find it lacking."
"Feb 01, 2020",4,"The fourth best SW saga! Fans are very wrongs about this film, is a great movie of the prequel. The battles of Geonosis, the story, the love story, the man hunt, the special effect &amp; the lightsabers fights are very nice. This Star wars film is great in some ways and very less of the imperfections. A good SW movie."
"Jan 28, 2020",2.5,"I personally like this film more than Phantom Menace, even if it is bad. The film had a few really good fight scenes and the ideas involving Boba and Jango Fett were pretty cool. While there still are many narrative issues and poorly done characters, there is enough action to make the film a slight improvement over Phantom Menace."
"Jan 28, 2020",2.5,"The second film in the trilogy shows continuity with its predecessor but for all the wrong reasons. Again you can only get an enjoyment out of watching if you're a true die-hard Star Wars fan and even then it's hard to get enjoyment out of this film. CGI and special effects are once again look poor or at least outdated. Poor writing has once again lead to poor dialogue between characters, very noticeable with Anakin and Padme relationship. Many of the lines between one another are corny and cheesy, not in a good way which ends up making there seem like little chemistry with one another which is disappointing as the romance with them is a main part of the film. The brightest part of the movie in my eyes is the fight on Geonosis, seeing all the Jedi fighting with one another made for a very cool sequence. Ewan McGregor also had an improved performance as Obi-Wan, showing drastic change from his character in the first film."
"Jan 26, 2020",1,The acting is trash! The script is trash! Everything is trash! This is trying to make money at its worst!
"Jan 25, 2020",0.5,God awful acting. Poor script. Cheesy CGI. This is as bad as Phantom Menace. Ick!
"Jan 23, 2020",2.5,"With this episode George Lucas punches above his weight class by attempting to elevate Star Wars to a far more complex, character and dialogue focused story than before. Simultaneously trying to pay homage to darker mature scifi films like his earliest work THX 1138 and respected neo noir masterpiece Blade Runner while still trying to maintain the charm and fun that people have come to expect from a romp through ""A Galaxy Far Far Away"". There's a complex political conflict, an assassination plot, a forbidden love affair, a dark brooding lead with complex motivations, entire scenes dedicated to character building dialogue and emotional monologues to highlight the acting. The only problem with this dialogue heavy film is that while George Lucas is a genius when it comes to creating interesting worlds and lore and pioneering new film tech he, to his own admission, can't write natural sounding dialogue to save his life; as Sir Alec Guinness put it, ""...[George Lucas'] dialog was appalling"" and many of the other actors Lucas worked with agreed. Fortunately for the original trilogy Lucas brought in talented writers, directors and actors to fine tune his scripts but unfortunately for this film and the prequel trilogy as a whole he wrote and edited the the prequel scripts almost entirely on his own. Not to say this movie doesn't have redeeming qualities. The action is very entertaining and the set pieces, sound design and cinematography are dazzling and the story actually is quite interesting. I'd recommend this movie if only for the reason that it laid the ground work for the vastly superior multiple Emmy Award winning  tv shows Star War Clone Wars (2003-2004) created by Genndy Tarkovsky and Star Wars The Clone Wars (2008-2013, 2020) created by Lucasfilm Animation which in turn spawned other critically acclaimed series like Star Wars Rebels and The Mandalorian not to mention the countless hilarious memes this movie has spawned."
"Jan 22, 2020",4,"Attack of the Clones is underrated. If you accept the melodramatic dialogue and the unlikable main character, you can appreciate the suspense, the groundbreaking visual effects, and poignant story and the epic fight scenes. An assassination plot on a senator's life sets in motion a detective story cross-cut with a forbidden love story in the wake of an imminent civil war. The story is full of shocking revelations, abduction, mass murder, and political intrigue."
"Jan 22, 2020",3,"""Attack of the Clones"", the second installment in the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy is marginally better than its immediate predecessor but is again cut short by overuse of CGI and underdeveloped characters. The romance arc is cheesy, the battles are only decent, and the acting leaves something to be desired. But putting all aside, it isn't a terrible movie, and several moments give you the classic nostalgic feeling. Well, one step at a time.

55/100"
"Jan 20, 2020",3.5,Episode II explores on the lore that episode I brought to the table. A good launching point into the clone wars Tv show as well. 
"Jan 19, 2020",1.5,"Still terrible acting and dialogue. Only slightly better than phantom menace. Anakin and Padme's love is totally not believable. Anakin as a character is whiny and unstable, and seems totally unVadar like."
"Jan 19, 2020",2,"It could have been worse, hahaha ^^'"
"Jan 19, 2020",3.5,The worst of the prequel trilogy but still better than anything Disney has put out.
"Jan 18, 2020",1,"Terrible writing, shoddy acting, and an over reliance on blue/green screen, none which is redeemed by the scarce moments of decent filmmaking. "
"Jan 18, 2020",1,"The worst of all the Star Wars movies, Attack of the Clones is an exercise in tedium.  All of the problems of its predecessor are back ten-fold.  Even worse, we are subjected to the most creepy and awkward love story ever seen in a major studio release.  George Lucas' blatant attempt at cashing in on Titanic's success sinks.  This one isn't even for the fans."
"Jan 17, 2020",3,Least favorite of the prequel trilogy. 
"Jan 15, 2020",2.5,"It got old quite quickly, especially the cgi"
"Jan 15, 2020",3.5,Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones is a little off track when it comes to the acting. But in the end the satisfaction wins.
"Jan 15, 2020",1.5,"Pros: They made Jar Jar's role smaller and less annoying. Ewan McGregor is still Good as Obi-Wan and I do like Yoda and his fight with Count Dooku. I think Christopher Reeve as Count Dooku is pretty good and Ian Mccdumind still does a pretty good job as Sheev Palpatine. I think that CGI Yoda is the only good CGI in this movie. I do like the battle of Geonosis because we get to see all of the Jedi work together. I do like how they had the plans for the death star this early in the saga. I do think Shmi's death is very sad and Anakin killing the sand people was the first sign of Vader and I liked that.  I also do like the Clone troopers and that literally all I like in this movie because I just don't like this movie.

Cons: The prequel problems are apparent in this movie because the dialogue has got to be some of the cringiest stuff put in a blockbuster film especially between Anakin and Padme and the Romance was so bad and it was very forced.  The way the Romance played out was disappointing because it was something I did want from the originals but it was executed very poorly.  If you thought Anakin was bad in the Phantom Menace he is worse in this film because of the cringy dialogue and he is acting so creepy around Padme and it is so cringy and makes this film dreadful.  The graphics are really bad in this film and it makes it look like a bunch of people are walking through cartoons. This movie has the worst lightsaber fight in all of StarWars' history because they are just spinning lightsabers around and it could have been so much better and the obvious Count Dooku stunt double. This is hands down the worst lightsaber fight in Starwars I know people enjoy the Jango Fett versus Obi-Wan fight but it is laughably bad because all these explosions knock over Obi-Wan and no scars, scars or damage is really done. We don't see Obi-Wan and Anakin bonding. Even though this movie does have it's moments they should have lasted longer and Anakin killing those sand people could have been the most memorable moment of the entire saga. There are only 3 moments in this movie that I like and they aren't even great there just good. Nothing in this movie really works and on rewatch I usually skip the romance 

I'm gonna give this movie a (D+"
"Jan 14, 2020",3.5,"Bom, mas desnecessário. Fora dois ou três acontecimentos ele é totalmente dispensável para a saga. Cenas de batalha empolgam, bons CGis para a época. História não empolga entretanto."
"Jan 14, 2020",2,"It used to be the worst Star Wars before the dark hours of the sequel. The love story is boring and poorly written. It is important though as it explains the existence of Leia and Luke. I just find it to be really boring.

EwanMcGregor's haircut is awful but he's still the best character."
"Jan 13, 2020",0.5,"Just straight up NO! This pile of trash should have never reached past the notion in some writing room. Money be damned. You don't need another billion dollars, Lucas. This should never have been made. As far as I am concerned, it hasn't."
"Jan 12, 2020",0.5,A politician falls in love with a teenager. There's also meaningless fighting at the end. 142 minutes of runtime 10 of which are story. Rise of Skywalker gets bad ratings while this flaming piece of garbage has been branded as a Star Wars for almost 18 years.
"Jan 11, 2020",3.5,"With an unbelievable romance and some cheesy dialogues, it makes Attack Of The Clones a bit bland but saves it the plot and performance of Ewan Mcgregor followed by a great final sequence that the movie is an improvement to Episode I."
"Jan 09, 2020",4.5,"Amazing, little bad dialog and acting but it's not a distraction. Anakin ""foreshadowing"" 
turn to the dark side may be annoying to fans who watched the original trilogy first but here is a reminder this is apart of the prequel trilogy so everyone knows that Anakin is turning to the dark side at some point we need to know how Anakin was turning from good to evil."
"Jan 09, 2020",0.5,what sickens me the most about this movie is the fact that it looks so bad. the cgi is so frikin bad even for 2002. it looks like a cartoon. even the cgi of the original trilogy and i mean the original cut the space battles there looked way more convincing then this atrocity. in audition to that the action scenes which looks terrible go for too long. the movie bearly has any story. its just cartoony action scene after cartoony action scene. and its boring as hell. phantom menace had this problem as hell. both this one and phantom menace are atrocities. phantom menace i think is a little better then this one. attack of the clones is just the lowest of the low. i dont understand how george lucas thought this cartoony cgi is any good.
"Jan 09, 2020",2,Jango Fett's fight scenes with Obi-wan and seeing how storm troopers came to be is cool but the movie is plagued with bad acting and a love story between two characters that have zero onscreen chemistry together. Oh and lets not forget CGI Yoda #aweful
"Jan 09, 2020",2,As unneccesary as episode I.
"Jan 08, 2020",4,"Second prequel movie is better than people think, great story, visuals, action and music. Began the Clone War has."
"Jan 08, 2020",3,"Star Wars's 6 Lucas films are all good, in my eyes this one is just a good example of bad dialogue, and getting carried away. Ewan McGregor and this little mystery plot about this character who you never even see or hear after the first 20 minutes are all that interest me for a bit, the final 2 big action sequences save this movie from absolutely sucking, but it's not really worth sitting for 2h and 26M, not even memes can save this film"
"Jan 07, 2020",1.5,"The worst part of this movie is that it proved that episode 1 was not a mistake. In my opinion this is the worst movie of the franchise, and a terrible movie by any merits."
"Jan 04, 2020",0.5,"I think i fell asleep the first 5 minutes!
In my opinion the worst SW film of all time!
It's just unintressting and weird!
1/10"
"Jan 04, 2020",3,Mediocre middle movie of the sequel trilogy which could have had a better second act. The third act does somewhat save the movie.
"Jan 02, 2020",3,Much better than episode 1 but nowhere near as good as the original trilogy.
"Jan 02, 2020",4,Very good Star Wars films and introducing Hayden Christensen in this movie and did not watched this film when I was little I think I saw a tiny clip of it on TV.
"Jan 01, 2020",3,Better than the Phantom Menace
"Jan 01, 2020",4.5,"I thought this movie was one thrilling joy ride, don‘t care what others say. Surpassed only by its successor and Empire"
"Jan 01, 2020",2.5,"The worst of the Star Wars prequels seems to get worse with age.  The best that can be said about this film is that it introduces a lot of interesting alien ideas and cultures that are often fun to explore; if not in the films, in video games like Knights of the Old Republic."
"Dec 31, 2019",2.5,"Good Stuff: Jango Fett, the final battle, casting.

Bad Stuff: The Plot, Doesn't feel like a star wars movie, the battle droid building anion and paddle  scene, The Anakin jumping out of ship scene is the worst scene in all of star wars, Yoda isn't used well enough, Count dooku, no real character development except for anakin, obi-wan, and kind of padme, Way to boring, too much packed into the movie, horrible plot."
"Dec 31, 2019",5,Amazing I love this film &lt;3
"Dec 31, 2019",2,"Definitely the weakest of the 6 Lucas movies. Its confusing, it lags for extended time then moves at a breakneck speed, but it still has its moments."
"Dec 31, 2019",5,This is when Star Wars was epic
"Dec 30, 2019",2,"Next to The Last Jedi, Attack of the Clones is probably the worst entry in the Star Wars franchise. Hayden Christensen's acting and dialogue were really awful and let me wandering what would have happened if George Lucas had at least surrounded himself better to carry out the prequels. Still, the plot mystery was really interesting, so was the lightsaber fight at the end and Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi. That unfortunately wasn't enough to save this movie."
"Dec 30, 2019",4.5,GREAT FILM GEORGE LUCAS
"Dec 30, 2019",3,By far my least favorite of the Star Wars movies. It has its moments but they are very few and far between
"Dec 30, 2019",4,"I love all my Star Wars movies. But this is the worst of them. Still pretty good, (Jango, Dooku) just seems to be very slow toward the middle."
"Dec 30, 2019",1.5,"I'm not a diehard Star Wars fan. I've seen all the movies, seen them all more than once even, and I have my opinions, but when I see the way people talk about Star Wars online, I can't really find myself behaving the way that ""true fans"" or whathaveyou do. That being said, I think that the majority of the Star Wars films have been pretty good. The notable exception to this, for me at least, is the prequels. And yes you can include the animated Clone Wars movie that they made in that era too. These four movies, again, for me, are all bad. But even amongst them, there is still a ranking in my mind, and in that list, at the very bottom sits Attack of the Clones. Yes it is this movie which holds the title, of the very worst Star Wars theatrical release of all time."
"Dec 29, 2019",5,"Exciting movie, bad dialogue but good cast and plot."
"Dec 29, 2019",5,"I'm re-watching the old prequels - I haven't seen in Attack of the Clones in years. Honestly, I thought it was pretty good. Despite everyone's criticism, I thought Hayden Christensen was a great Anakin Skywalker: I think he does justice to Anakin's character - an emotional teenager with incredible abilities. In comparison to how Disney treated Star Wars, I still feel the prequels do justice to Star Wars world - like the culture of the jedi and treatment of the force. I think the prequels' story is absolutely incredible - the way that the Sith took over the galaxy by creating a false war which killed off the Jedi and increased the power of the head of state, who happened to be a Sith Lord in disguise. Emperor Palpatine is by far one of the best villains I've ever seen. The entire story is so good and so sound - all of it makes complete sense within the logic of the Star Wars universe. I actually really liked the books, like Revenge of the Sith book, and I think the great Star Wars story really helps that. Overall, I think Attack of the Clones is a pretty solid movie."
"Dec 28, 2019",3.5,"If you can get past the first act of Anakin and Padme falling in love, Attack of the Clones is a fun action-packed adventure even without the most well put together story."
"Dec 28, 2019",5,"Love it!  My favorite, on the same level as( For Me) Empire Strikes Back!  Both are my favorite movies :)."
"Dec 28, 2019",4,"Severely underrated. People found it boring and overly complicated, plus people like to criticize George Lucas for everything. Yes, some of the lines were not what you'd expect, ""I hate sand"" but remember, A New Hope didn't have the best lines always either. Luke spoke how any American kid spoke in the 70s, when Lucas wrote that film. Anakin spoke like the 2000s."
"Dec 28, 2019",1.5,Paying attention to the plot of the movie it actually isn't that bad and COULD have been one of the best installments to the franchise but how it was portrayed  on screen completely  ruined it the acting was bad and the opening scenes almost looks like it is going to be a cartoon.
"Dec 28, 2019",0.5,if I was forced in a theater to watch this again I would bring math workbooks to do because they are so much more entertaining than this garbage. No good story. NO GOOD ACTION PERIOD. Horribly written cheesy romance. BORING.
"Dec 28, 2019",4,"In retrospect, a pretty good star wars film. Just check when your phone when Anakin is wooing Padme."
"Dec 28, 2019",3.5,"6.75/10. Though an improvement over it's predecessor, writer/director George Lucas has a long way to go in restoring glory to this franchise. Some great action sequences, superb effects, and great art direction are to be expected from a 'Star Wars' picture, and this one delivered. The improvements over the first episode comes from the acting and plot line featuring Ewan McGregor, who develops Obi-Wan into the wiser, more recognizable Jedi master we know from the original trilogy while playing psuedo-detective for the bulk of the film. Christopher Lee as the primary villain is a treasure also a treasure in his role. The film sputters when it focuses on the ghastly love story between Jedi padawan Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). The forbidden love angle is so worn out and rife with cliche that it's difficult not to laugh at. Christensen portraying his young, dumb, and in love character more like a psychotic abuser is baffling. Portman's acting might have made sense had Anakin been portrayed correctly, but Christensen boxed her character into seeming foolish, unable to see the mad man before her eyes, and certainly not discerning enough to be a galactic senator. None of this is helped by the script, which gives the actors nothing to work with and is awful throughout. A mild improvement isn't strong enough evidence that Lucas should continue as the primary creative architect of this franchise."
"Dec 27, 2019",2,I thought this was easily the worst starwars film until I saw the last Jedi.
"Dec 27, 2019",1,"There are very few redeemable moments in this film. The problem is the story. It's just not that interesting from the very start. Even the ending, which is exciting, is poorly executed. Anikan and Padme's story in particular becomes boring, and their relationship feels forced and uncomfortable. To be honest, without one or two scenes that are really great Star War moments (Anikan and the Tusken Raiders, Anikan, Obi-Wan, Yoda vs. Dooku) this movie is difficult to watch."
"Dec 27, 2019",5,"After watching Disney rubbish movie. This is really a damm good movie. At least the lightsaber fight was damn good. At least the story make sense. At least Obiwan was really convincing. At least the space fight is really good. At least the storm trooper die. At least Jedi(s) are powerful but they still die. And all Jedi(s) has their strength and weakness, they each have different roles and is very clearly shown in the movie. Disney's Star Wars is... plotless, illogical, breaks all physics, no continuity from previous 6 movies (plus Rogue One). No idea why Rey Space Jesus was ever needed to go through 3 movies when she could single handedly just destroy the entire Universe in the first 5 mins of the film. She can literally do anything. Teleport, heal people, bring dead people back to life, do Jedi mind trick, lift entire mountain range basically just do everything and anything she wants. Disney Star Wars is... just wasting people's time, it's rubbish. Its not inspiring and its almost just illogical (poor) action. Even the action sequence is BAD... REALLY BAD. I give George Lucas  STAR WARS 10 out of 5 stars. For being logical, consistent and good fight sequence."
"Dec 27, 2019",5,Yoda`s lightsaber duel. Awesome
"Dec 27, 2019",4,It was good. Not great. But I ♥️ Star Wars.
"Dec 27, 2019",5,"It certainly has it's flaws, but all things considered this is a fun movie"
"Dec 26, 2019",3,A movie too based on a romance with bad acting and overly long counsel scenes but still has the action Star Wars always delivers.
"Dec 26, 2019",5,I like this even if it has flaws
"Dec 26, 2019",3,"Fast paced, but the acting a little forced at times."
"Dec 26, 2019",1,Boring on the first half. Only redeeming quality was the actual Battle in Geonosis.
"Dec 26, 2019",2.5,"Quietly meanders through, with interest."
"Dec 26, 2019",2.5,"Getting rid of jar jar binks is probably the reason why this score is higher than that of episode 1. But aside from that, the story is a bit of the same quality (not inherently bad) as of the previous entry, and also suffers from the prequel curse once again. But the action is stepped up a notch with noticable improvements in the acting department as well. The only main problem is that of anakin and padme's relationship which is downright cringey and hard to watch. However in the end still a good watch and a dramatic improvement from episode 1"
"Dec 26, 2019",4,It has some problems but it is really good movie.
"Dec 25, 2019",2.5,It was better than first but not that good
"Dec 25, 2019",5,A great 2nd movie in the trilogy!
"Dec 25, 2019",2.5,Dialogue is poor and probably the worst romance in history. Some great fights though stop it from falling into the terrible category
"Dec 25, 2019",1.5,This movie didn't have to be made the thing that really saves it is the action scenes and the final act otherwise  I think this movie is the worst of the prequels ( yes I like The Phantom Menace better)
"Dec 25, 2019",3,Lackluster dialogue but cool action scenes and an overall ok movie.
"Dec 25, 2019",4,Really really good. 
"Dec 25, 2019",3,"A love story that cringes on unnatural dialogues that make every love scene painstakingly to watch. A new villain played by Christopher Lee that doesn't really do it for me. This movie does possess one of the greatest scenes in Star Wars history, though. Some excellent action sequence and great action."
"Dec 25, 2019",3,Good for a movie but mediocre for Star Wars
"Dec 24, 2019",3.5,"It is very cheesy and the love interest felt forced. The plot is good but just seems to be lacking development. However, it is still good because the fight scenes and other stuff are awesome"
"Dec 24, 2019",3,"This one split me down the middle, it has very few good moments, however, when they're good- they're REALLY good.

The battle of Geonosis is one of the best moments in the Star Wars franchise"
"Dec 24, 2019",5,"its very good, the clone war is epic!!!"
"Dec 23, 2019",0.5,This movie made me hate life.
"Dec 23, 2019",3,"In my opinion, this is the worst Star Wars movie. The plot is muddled with pointless points, yet some of them are interesting choices that you do appreciate. It's overall an okay movie, but it suffers from nonmemerable characters who you will forget right away."
"Dec 23, 2019",2.5,"A sequel worthy of the original - the second episode increasingly convinces that the prequel trilogy is ""Star Wars for kids."" Almost no frame is complete without a terrible chromakey, every second creature is a miserable CGI, it just hurts to look at it. Ridiculous love line takes almost half the timing, while the branded action is given only 20 final minutes. Irritatingly wooden Hayden Christensen with his close-ups finishes off the already weak tape, the only salvation of which is in the development of the overall history of the Saga and tolerable battle scenes."
"Dec 23, 2019",1,"I can stand a genuinely bad in every way movie, where you can tell going into it that the movie was going to fail straight from the premise. But what really gets me above almost all things is when you have a premise for a movie that is so great, so exactly what you would want, and so perfectly decided that you think ""There's no way this could fail."" Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is one of those movies that infuriates me so much for all those reasons. On paper this sounds like such a good film. It has speeder chases through Coruscant, fighting with kid Boba Fett and his bad-ass dad, the foundations of what would later be the Stormtroopers (Kinda), seeing Anakin Skywalker as a jedi before he falls to the darkside, More Ewan McGregor screentime, a whole stadium full of jedi fighting, the epic romance that would lead to the birth of the Legacy twins, SIR CHRISTOPHER LEE as a charismatic Villain! This sounds like it would be literally the best Star Wars movie ever. But despite every reason above this movie is usually, and rightfully so, considered to be the worst in the series. It looks pretty, it sounds pretty, it even had some good ideas on paper. But, and I really can't stress this enough, this movie is so goddamned boring. I love Star Wars Y'all. So much, but AOTC is a massive low point in this series. For every good decision made here there are 5 more bad ones to cover it up. None of these things redeem it, not one. It's is trash, and it sometimes makes me regret being a fan of Star Wars.      -Rhenn"
"Dec 23, 2019",0.5,Just as bad as the phantom menace
"Dec 23, 2019",4,Really good film (except a couple of love scenes)
"Dec 22, 2019",3.5,"Though the movie is dull at parts with plot points that are uninteresting and bad dialogue at parts, this second installment to the prequel trilogy benefits more from an increased emphasis on thrilling action and a great performance by the late Christopher Lee. Though not the best in the prequel trilogy, it's still a appealing film to some~"
"Dec 22, 2019",5,"It shows you the repressed feelings and the disturbance that is slowly growing in Anakin. We see the origin of the Storm Trooper and the majestic start of the Clone Wars. A romance movie, with powerful music, great acting, plot, scenery, choreography, character development; Despite the absurd criticism without foundation, it is one of the best episodes in all Star Wars."
"Dec 22, 2019",4,not the best movie ever but still entertaining and watchable
"Dec 22, 2019",5,"I absolutely recommend this to any SW fan!  Many people will say they dislike the dialog or acting or whatever, however the characters are perfectly captured as they are supposed to be.

Take Anakin, people complain about his skills with complementing someone to whom he is attracted.  Well how on Earth is a guy who was around Jedi (who are against such (as an order) and before that was on a backwater world as a slave without much outside interaction?  People never think about this.

As a side note the novelisation is a must read if you are into reading.

All in all 15 stars out of 5 for me :)"
"Dec 22, 2019",2.5,"Good Action, but Anakin was whiny and annoying throughout this film. Not worth watching."
"Dec 22, 2019",3.5,Awesome movie! Everything a Star Wars movie should include is being dealt with!
"Dec 22, 2019",4,I know there's a lot of hate for this movie and I don't really know why. It does have a lot of drama that some might find boring but other than that I can't see any real reason for the hate. I do feel that people are too hard on Hayden Christiansen. He does a great job as an angsty teenager filled with anger and whose world is turning upside down.
"Dec 22, 2019",1,Weak storytelling.  No star wars atmosphere. Stumbles from the begining.
"Dec 22, 2019",5,that Battle in geonosis though!
"Dec 22, 2019",3.5,good. if you love star wars you will enjoy this.
"Dec 22, 2019",0.5,Hayden Christianson and awful dialogue. Nuff said
"Dec 22, 2019",1,Boy where do I get started. I could talk all day on the flaws of this movie but its hard with how forgettable it is. If someone asked me what the plot is I would not be able to tell you. The dialogue doesn't sound human and is robotic. Poor direction for the actors leaving them with no chemistry or sense of the scenes. The worst part of it all is the dreadful and forced romance. I would skip this movie in my Star Wars viewing/binge and would be embarrassed to associate it with my love for the series.
"Dec 22, 2019",0.5,"Attack of the most boring movie ever. Like Phantom Menace,  this deserves a 🦃 rating."
"Dec 21, 2019",4.5,This movie grew on me since day 1 and I love the movie
"Dec 21, 2019",4,Not the best but not the worse either
"Dec 21, 2019",2,"Messy writing that detracts from the original trilogy and characters, far too much CGI, clunky dialogue, and an excellent score."
"Dec 21, 2019",5,"I actually liked this movie, I thought it was well done."
"Dec 21, 2019",2,Words cannot express the disappointment and utter depression this movie makes me feel due to the terribleness that is 19 year old Anakin Skywalker. It houses one of the worst lightsaber battles in the entire saga (Anakin v. Dooku).
"Dec 21, 2019",2,No longer the worst Star Wars movie thanks to The Last Jedi
"Dec 21, 2019",4,Anakin could have been better but Obi-wan was good
"Dec 21, 2019",3.5,"some of the best visuals in the series, but lacking in some areas. still have a blast watching it"
"Dec 21, 2019",0.5,The dialogue was so bland and cringe throughout the whole movie and didn't head anywhere and I don't even know what happened throughout the movie until the third act which actually was quite good.
"Dec 20, 2019",3,"Dialogue is not its strong point. While taking a step in the right direction from the Phantom Menace, the stilted and awkward conversations and exchanges hinder the enjoyment and thrilling portions of the movie. While not bad, it is far from perfect and does not get me re-watching it often."
"Dec 20, 2019",0.5,"Growing up with the original trilogy, and watching this trilogy was a resounding disappointment. This was the beginning of the downfall of Lucas. The special effects looked bubbly and cartoonish. It completely lacked the feel of the original movies. The vehicles looked more advanced/elegant that the original movies, and that doesn't make any sense because they were prequels. The acting was some of the worst I'd ever seen in a major motion picture. Surely technology advanced. The one saving grace for this trilogy was the incredible acting for the famous character Obi-Wan. Sam Neeson was incredible throughout.

The second film barely edges out this historically awful first in the prequel trilogy."
"Dec 20, 2019",1.5,"Foreplay, cuddling – a Jedi craves not these things"
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,Ehhh it was okay romance terrible 
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,It’s actually not bad
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Jango Fett is so cool. Love the dogfight with Kenobi.
"Dec 20, 2019",2,"I have to say it. Star War Episode II made the prequels worse than I had ever imagined. The only aspects that I really enjoyed were the action sequences, the battle between Yoda and Count Dooku, and Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan. I didn't like the relationship between Padme and Anakin, the screenplay is terrifying and boring, and the visuals are overused. Overall, Attack of the Clones is one of the worst Star Wars films so far."
"Dec 20, 2019",3,now my eyes do not hurt from what is happening on the screen.
"Dec 20, 2019",3,"Still not that good, giving us some things we all wanted and showing us some new things and characters."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Love this movie. Mostly because my wedding was the inspiration behind this film. 
"Dec 20, 2019",5,A movie ahead of its time!
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"Could it be better? Yes
How much better? Not much"
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Ewan MacGregor is fantastic
"Dec 20, 2019",2.5,I would call this movie an improvement over it's predecessor only because it had a crummy universe to build off of and still didn't completely flop as well as being more visually interesting
"Dec 20, 2019",3,"It was the worst film of the trilogy but I feel like it was because they tried to fit this into a trilogy, if they maybe spent more time and expanded this to either a longer movie or another movie then it would be better, Anakin's romance feels rushed and some of the dialogue seems explanatory less natural"
"Dec 20, 2019",2,"It's the worst of all 9 films. The storytelling ist horrible and the dialogs: "" I hate sand"" nuff said...."
"Dec 20, 2019",4,"I love this movie. There are so many great aspects to it, like the speeder chase, Anakin slowly turning more and more towards the darkside, and the introduction of the Clone Army. Jango Fett is great to see in his prime, and the end of the film just absolutely knocks it out of the park and makes up for any clunky dialogue. I like seeing Anakin and Padme fall in love. It is a vital part of the story. As vital as Han and Leia, or dare I say it; Rey and Kylo? ;)"
"Dec 20, 2019",3,My least favourit Star Wars movie. Still enjoyable though
"Dec 20, 2019",1.5,"I really want to give this film a better score, but I just can't. Here's the rub: This film indulges the silliest and most child-like parts of Star Wars. We get some great things here- Count Dooku, teenage Anakin, an adult Obi-Wan. But between these iconic moments are genuine nonsense. I don't mean child-like wonder nonsense either, but ""What the hell is even happening and why?"" kind of nonsense.

Ewan McGregor's performance is phenomenal, but for the most part, wasted on poor direction and cinematography. Ian McDiarmid is given more room to act here, and to surprising effect. Chistopher Lee is cheesy, but in all the best ways. 

Unfortunately, the center-piece to the film is a genuinely creepy romance that seems to fulfill the fantasies of thirteen year old boys... or maybe that was just me.

If you like Star Wars, you'll be able to sit through this film. Otherwise... just watch The Clone Wars tv show."
"Dec 20, 2019",2,"Good action, nothing else is good in this movie"
"Dec 20, 2019",5,The best prequel. The CGI holds up and is used in an amazing way. Christopher Lee is excellent as the villain.
"Dec 19, 2019",2,Stale acting with really little action until the back end of the movie. Such a poor excuse of a Star Wars film
"Dec 19, 2019",2,"""I don't like sand!"".... 
Dialogue is abominable"
"Dec 19, 2019",1.5,"Well, that could have been better. Did I watch a video game?"
"Dec 19, 2019",3,"Attack of the Clones is without a doubt the weakest entry in the prequel trilogy, as it is convoluted and the character interactions are very weak. The love story feels forced and cringe-worthy, the detective B-story, which ends up being more important for the A-story also suffers from a lack of cop-buddy for Obi-Wan to talk to. Anakin is in his whiney teenage phase, which makes for an uninteresting character and there is little to no interaction between him and Obi-Wan, which is what one would have hoped to get from this trilogy. The overabundance of CGI generated locations and effects is nauseating and stands in stark contrast to the original trilogy. Even at the time of release, everything felt out of place, because the CGI looked too crisp, too clean and as a result unrealistic.
If this was not a Star Wars movie, I would not recommend it. As it is a Star Wars film, it is still a must-see for the whole saga, as many of the most important plot points of the saga are being set up in this film. Natalie Portman also gets to do more in this film, than in both of the others and shines in her role. It is too bad that the bad writing leaves a bitter aftertaste to the otherwise wonderfully crafted story."
"Dec 19, 2019",5,Not as good as the other prequels but we get some good works building.
"Dec 19, 2019",5,So much better in retrospect compared to the shit we have gotten lately.
"Dec 19, 2019",2,"Absolutely the worst movie in the entire saga, but is still watchable, and I can see myself watching the movie another time!"
"Dec 19, 2019",4.5,"Tiene sus fallos pero presenta muchos grandes aportes en la historia, y tiene muchos momentos emocionantes"
"Dec 19, 2019",5,"I loved this film, just fantastic!"
"Dec 19, 2019",3.5,While not nearly as bad as The Phantom Menace there is enough action in this movie to keep you entertained.
"Dec 18, 2019",3.5,"Attack of the clones has it good scenes from kenobi, jango fett and count dooku overall satisfying star wars film with action."
"Dec 18, 2019",4,"CGI in it aged worse than practical effects of OT but other than that, this is peak Star Wars."
"Dec 18, 2019",3.5,The Clone Wars are the coolest and most interesting era in Star Wars.
"Dec 18, 2019",1.5,"Attack Of The Clones is awful. The acting is some of the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie, It is so slow and boring. Obi Wan is again the best part and the only good thing about this movie. Yoda is really cool but that is it. It is the Worst in the Saga."
"Dec 18, 2019",5,its good stop the Bullshit
"Dec 18, 2019",3,"Clones is nowhere near a perfect movie but when it clicks, it brings up all the emotions and heart of classic Star Wars. It's very nearly good.
 
Of course the visual effects are spectacular as is the character design but the same prequel flaws are also present. It's better than the phantom menace but not by much. A lot of the time it's pretty dumbfounding. There's just nowhere near enough of the good stuff."
"Dec 18, 2019",3,"Alot of bad dialogue and like in episode 1 too much bad CGI, but also alot of awesome lightsaber battles and an amazing Obi wan make this movie good"
"Dec 18, 2019",2.5,"Attack of the Clones is the worst prequel film, but thanks to some of the poor decisions made by Disney, no longer my least favorite Star Wars movie. 

As I said in my Phantom Menace Review, Disney should redo all of the CGI in the prequel films and bring it up to 2019 standards, which would go a long way towards making these films better.

The dialogue and acting in this film is worse than any in Episodes 1-7, though there are still some interesting moments in this film that make it feel like a Star Wars movie, unlike Solo and The Last Jedi. 

The assassin at the beginning of the film is interesting, Jango Fett is a cool villain, we get to see Mace Windu in action, I like Yoda's fighting, Anakin wielding two lightsabers is cool, Padme shows off how badass she is, and we get to see some of the seedy underbelly of Corusant, which I love.

My Review: C"
"Dec 18, 2019",0.5,"Wow. I stopped watching Star Wars after Phantom Menace... then tried to watch this recently. AotC is worse, the writing, acting and directing choices are so cringey, I had to turn it off."
"Dec 17, 2019",5,I like so much Kamino scenes
"Dec 17, 2019",4.5,"Star Wars Attack Of The Clones was a bit better than episode 1. The action is great, the story is great, the visual effects are fantastic."
"Dec 17, 2019",3,This movie did not have the best acting but it was decent
"Dec 16, 2019",1.5,"""I don't like sand. It's coarse and it gets everywhere."" - Anakin Skywalker

Well you know what Anakin, I feel the same way about you. The perfect way to summarize this movie is that you only watch it for the battle of geonosis and even that segment was underwhelming."
"Dec 15, 2019",0.5,Better than the Jar Jar but still a poorly written kids movie.
"Dec 15, 2019",3,The worst star wars movie but still not too bad
"Dec 15, 2019",4,"Great lines in this one, they don't like sand."
"Dec 14, 2019",2.5,This movie well it felt too slow. There's too much plots I can't focus on. Although it did have some moments that will play throughout the Saga.
"Dec 13, 2019",0.5,Sucked along with the other two in this set.  Totally ruined Star Wars.
"Dec 12, 2019",3.5,"Good, but the ating is not that great"
"Dec 12, 2019",1.5,"I like it because it's Star Wars, but this has some of the worse acting and dialogue in a movie I've ever seen."
"Dec 10, 2019",2,"This is definitely worse than Phantom Menace.... the pacing of the movie is all over the place, there isn't much action in the film, as there wasn't in EP I but this does have some of the worst and cringe stories dialogue ever put on screen and especially for a Star Wars movie (I don't like sand). The worst parts of the script comes when there is romance involving Padme and Anakin its just cringe every time they speak to each other.... there isn't much chemistry between the two actors at all, Hayden Christian acting is wooden. The action when it gets to it feels bland to watch, even the lightsaber fight at the end of the movie is just bad, at least PM had the Darth Maul fight along with the duel of the fates music... this is the most blandest Star Wars movie out there..... there isn't much good things about it."
"Dec 10, 2019",3,"I think this film gets to much crap its a good movie, nothing special, but I enjoy watching it every time."
"Dec 10, 2019",3.5,"I was critical on this movie at first thinking it was the worst one yet, but if you can look past the dialogue choices between Anakin and Padme, awesome movie. Geonosis and Kamino are two of my favorite Star Wars planets."
"Dec 09, 2019",1.5,It has not aged well with time. Only the last half of the movie mattered.
"Dec 09, 2019",1,"Poorly acted, poorly written, and seems blatantly targeted at children."
"Dec 09, 2019",5,Amazing film. Didn't deserve the hate it got. Must watch.
"Dec 09, 2019",2.5,Bad plot with unrealistically dumb decisions combined with a boring first 90 minutes bring this movie down. Slightly better than the Phantom Menace but still mediocre.
"Dec 08, 2019",1.5,"Let's be honest, there isn't a lot good going on here. There is no real draw for this film, and I always find myself skipping it. The pacing and dialogue are ""memeably"" awful, Mannequin Skywalker and Woodam Padmé's romance is boring and forced, and it doesn't have any emotion or plot."
"Dec 05, 2019",1.5,"After the failure of The Phantom Menace, I expected Lucas to learn. Instead, he made a worse film. The romance between Anakin and Padme feels so forced and is executed poorly. The whole jedi can't fall in love is a stupid rule that was created and broken in the same movie. The fight scenes were bad, especially the lightsaber one. Jar Jar Binks thankfully was made slightly better and had less screentime. The movie felt less directed towards kids. Besides Ewan McGregor's performance as Kenobi, everyone felt lame. At least The Phantom Menace had more realistic and less forced Chemistry with Anakin and his mom. Anakin and Padme feels bad, like who would date a girl that is at least 15 years older than him."
"Dec 03, 2019",1.5,"Craptacular movie, plagued by stupid writing, no kind of acting from most of the cast . This is the worst film since phantom menace . "
"Dec 02, 2019",3.5,Better then Disney. This was better then the last jedi
"Dec 01, 2019",4,How the Clone Wars began!
"Dec 01, 2019",4.5,"Proving that George Lucas was and is the creative soul of the entire Star Wars saga, this movie doesn't disappoint and continues the tradition of excellence in the franchise."
"Nov 29, 2019",3,This was a meh movie. Weird dialogue and somewhat bad writing and direction. The reason why we watched this is to understand how Darth Vader came to be. We could have just watch Phantom Menace and put 30 years later cut at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith. Fine actors but holy cow there was a ton of CGI.
"Nov 28, 2019",1,"Just when you thought it couldn’t get any worse it does. Episode II is a disaster of a movie. Featuring horrific writing, terrible acting from Hayden Christensen, and a sterile bland look thanks to a over abundance of CGI, this movie is painful to watch from start to finish. "
"Nov 24, 2019",3.5,"A cool Star Wars movie, specially for kids and teens."
"Nov 20, 2019",5,"This movie pulled me in from the first scene, and never let me go.  Hugely fun, great action, great plot (a sci-fi mystery thriller!), mostly great effects, great performance from Christopher Lee.  And Yoda fighting like a ninja!"
"Nov 19, 2019",4,"Dialogue with Anakin and Padme was again nothing much to speak of, but the acting and delivery were excellent. Plot continues to hold its own just fine if you can look past the dialogue. Also - watch this and Ep III in context with The Clone Wars TV show, and everything gets even better."
"Nov 19, 2019",2,it wasn't that bad but Ieli loves it and i want to make him sad.
"Nov 17, 2019",2,What happened to this franchise?
"Nov 16, 2019",5,"I think this is one of the best of the prequel trilogy, especially for Christopher Lee's excellent acting as Count Dooku and for the story remembering a bit like an investigative movie, remembering that we see the creation of the clones and the amazing Boba Fett."
"Nov 14, 2019",3.5,Way underrated movie
"Nov 14, 2019",2,My pick for the worst movie in the Star Wars franchise. It's a snoozefest and almost never picks up. The story is built around a romance that is difficult to buy. Even the Yoda scene that should have been cool is kind of a CGI nightmare. The acting is pretty poor across the board. It looks like none of them really even want to be there.
"Nov 12, 2019",2.5,"The weakest of the three prequels, didn't really like this film much."
"Nov 10, 2019",2.5,"Following on from the anti-climax of The Phantom Menace, this sequel attempts to up the action and the drama, but still manages to be a weak link in the overall Star Wars saga. The ‘romantic' scenes between Anakin and Padme contain some of the most risible dialogue ever seen in a major motion picture, and Christensen is unable to ever make his character come across as anything other than a grumpy teenager. Meanwhile, the over reliance on CGI and green screen throughout has the visual panache of a cutscene from a video game. If only as much attention was given to the characters; take Lee's Dooku for instance, who is a welcome addition to the universe but is introduced without fanfare. At least things pick up in the final act, and seeing Yoda go to town with a lightsaber almost makes everything OK."
"Nov 05, 2019",4,Better than the Last Jedi 
"Oct 31, 2019",5,"good movie, has some slow parts between padme and anakin where people are pissed off about, because the jedi isn´t a good womanizer, something that is just logical, because he is a teenager, finally back close to the love of his childhood, the only love, because while his schooling any kind of relations ship was strictly for bitten.
to be honest, if you don´t have the back information about the prequel trilogy, you miss a lot. but there is so much to know! so much is going on in the entire universe! so much better then the original trilogy, where the movies worked for them self really really good, but there wasn´t really any important stuff behind that..."
"Oct 31, 2019",3.5,"While still not living up to the original it is certainly a step up from ""The Phantom Menace"". This movie might have some cringy sequences and bad dialogue causing an unnatural romance story. It has a good amount of action-packed moments with connecting plotlines that give our characters a lot of growth, 7/10."
"Oct 30, 2019",3.5,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones was good. Definitely a worthy episode of an amazing saga.
"Oct 29, 2019",3.5,"Some fine visuals and battles, shame about the acting"
"Oct 29, 2019",3,"Bad Dialogue, good action, horrible love scenes, good universe building. Short and simple, AOTC is an average film with it's pros and cons."
"Oct 27, 2019",4,Seriously underated.
"Oct 25, 2019",1.5,"So essentially Attack of the Clones is our wish granted after The Phantom Menace. There's no more Jar Jar, and they replaced Jake Lloyd. Ideally, that would fix everything, right? You'd think so.

So Jar Jar and Jake Lloyd are gone, Ewan McGregor actually has something to do other than sit around in an empty spaceship, there's no pod racing, Natalie Portman seems to have broken out of her plastic mannequin, there's more action, we're starting to see Anakin's turn toward the dark side, all of this should be a recipe for a much better movie than The Phantom Menace. And essentially, this is The Phantom Menace, with all of those tweaks applied. 

But. 

But I'm just going to say it now. I still don't know which movie is worse. I really don't. 

It's like George Lucas was so pissed off at fan outrage toward Jar Jar and Jake Lloyd that he took them out, only to replace them with a bland story, illogic, and terrible dialogue. 

I still can't decide who really wrote the script. Eight year old Jake Lloyd, or Jar Jar Binks. 

Before I get into it, just know that this review will have spoilers, but honestly, I think my ranting will be more entertaining than the movie. The movie goes off the rails, and I just might as well.  That's the natural order of things. 

It's the way of the Force, if you will. 

In one of the opening scenes we see Anakin openly arguing with Obi-Wan about everything a Jedi is and is not supposed to be. You'd think they'd have these discussions in private, or I don't know, sometime in the last ten years that they've been together. Instead, they have this bickering match in front of the queen and her advisors. 

It might as well have been Michael and Jan fighting in front of their dinner guests. At least that was more believable.  And entertaining. 

And Anakin comes on strong to Padme. Like, creepily strong. I'm pretty sure that once ten years has gone by before seeing each other, that automatically makes you strangers. All I can say is, lucky for him the MeToo movement hasn't caught up with their galaxy yet, because otherwise he'd have been ostracized from the Jedi counsel well before this movie got under way. 

But then again, Padme's not helping matters. There's that scene in the fire-lit bedroom where Anakin's like, ""I can't breath when I'm not with you,"" Padme is dressed like she was on the set for Fifty Shades of Grey. 

Look, I enjoy the espionage, as mindless and pointless as it is. We get to see Obi-Wan on an actual Jedi quest to figure out who's behind the order of the clones. I wouldn't have minded a little more Mission: Impossible brains added to it though, some sort of twist. Like, even something as simple as having Dooku be the most likeable Jedi on the counsel. Someone so affable and  convincing that even Yoda is smitten by him, and then when his secret is revealed, we're all thrown off. 

Instead, they're like, ""Yeah, it's this random dude whom we've never shown before. Surprise!"" 

I think I'm in the minority of people who actually like the chase scene through the city when Obi-Wan is hanging off of that destroyer and Anakin is trying to catch him. And outside of Jar Jar Binks, it's the first time in any of the prequels that they attempted a decent joke, when Obi-Wan was like, ""What took so long?"" And Anakin was like, ""I thought I'd look around for a spaceship that I liked. The right kind, the right color . . ."" It wasn't hilarious, but the movies have been so dry up until this point, that I kind of smiled because it was at least trying to be charming. Like when a toddler tells  a really bad joke, it's just so cute because they're trying so hard. 

And let me preface by saying that even though I'm pointing out things I like in this movie, I realize that almost every frame of this movie makes no goddamned sense and is completely illogical. 

Like young horny Anakin being assigned to protect the senator, who's also young and horny, but they're forbidden to bump uglies. Not to mention it's his first assignment! 

Let me break this down in earthly terms. On Naboo, the queens are elected officials that can only serve two terms. Queen Amidala was such a beloved queen, that the people wanted her to keep serving, but instead she succeeded Palpatine as the representative of the Galactic Senate.  

That's like if John Wilkes Booth had his nuts cut off and had his throat slit by a band of freed slaves on his way to the theater, and Lincoln had lived to serve out his presidency and see the Civil War to a close (I realize this could be a Tarantino movie), and Lincoln was so favored by the civilians of the United States of America, that they insist he stay in office as a senator or some official role, but then the White House catches word that he's being targeted by John Wilkes' brother. Because he's pissed that his brother is dead and that the country is unified under the Union's flag. The White House catches word of the assassination attempt, so they send our lanky hero into hiding, and who do they get to protect him? 

Travis, from Old Yeller. Because he's young, ambitious, and has a gun. 

Not the more experienced, available Jedi. But a Padwan. 

A young, horny, creepy Padwan. 

But as I'm watching this, I can't help but wonder. If someone like Leonardo Dicaprio had been assaulted with this role, would he have been able to pull off the shitty dialogue? 

Up until this moment of the movie, aside from the cool chase scene after the attempted assassination on Padme, nothing happens. 

NOTHING.

Qui Gon in on some secret spy mission, and we're expected to believe that Anakin and Padme are falling in love. This is where I can blame the acting, the script, and the directing. Nothing works. All three of these elements are like the monsters at the end of this movie, and we're in the arena as audience members being eaten alive by this nonsense. 

I can much quicker believe that Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs have more sexual chemistry with each other than Anakin and Padme. And they're like two of the most badass cops in movies. Not that gay guys can't be badass cops. At least not that Hollywood has shown us, anyway . . . 

There is a really cool scene where Jengo Fett is chasing Obi-Wan through an asteroid field. I love when they go through one, it's very claustrophobic, and then Obi-Wan releases spare parts out of his ship that sets off the missile and then an asteroid starts to rotate as Jengo's ship flies by and we see Obi-Wan's ship clinging to the backside like a bug. Good stuff. 

But, because it's the prequels, nothing can go unspoiled. Throughout this whole scene, there's no music, just the sound effects, and it's almost creepy. But then you've got young Boboa Fett narrating with his annoying raspy little kid's voice. ""Dad, go faster."" ""Dad, you're losing him."" ""Dad, there he goes."" 

It was like the spirit of Jake Lloyd lived on. 

It did make amends for the dumbass way Boboa dies in a few years. 

I had forgotten this, but I loved that they visited Tatooine and met Luke's aunt and uncle. It was a good moment because they were in the same room in that hut where we'll later here Obi-Wan tell Luke about the force and Darth Vader. It gave a somewhat valid reason for having Anakin go on this quest to save his mom, another character we're supposed to care about for some reason. 

And I love how Luke's theme is playing during this scene, but then seconds later we get Darth Maul's theme when Anakin is looking for his mom, like John Williams put the wrong track in.

And then, not like it matters, but Anakin's mom pulls a Yoda and conveniently dies just in time to see her son for a couple of seconds and say a few words. 

And is it just me, or does that conveyer belt scene remind you of Nick Arcade, from start to finish? A pretty fun scene in a movie that's been dry as toast. In any other movie, I would have hated it, but we've waited so long for something interesting to happen, that I'll take what I can get at this moment, with the terrible CGI and C3P0 getting his body swapped with a clone. If this whole movie has been dry toast, then this scene is like a glob of unsalted butter being plopped down onto it. 

I'll take it. 

But for fuck's sake. Did R2-D2 have to fly?

This. This, right here. This is the very first moment in the prequel trilogy that was screaming at us from the big screen back in 2001 when this came out, that George Lucas isn't taking anything that we know and love from the original trilogy, seriously. 

This is the moment when all that hardcore fandom should have died down a little bit and people could stop and see Star Wars for what it is. A silly movie. Continuity means jack shit in this saga. 

I mean, what are they going to do next? Force project their characters into major conflicts? 

I really do wish the movie started off like the execution show started off. As soon as the prisoners are tied up, the announcer wastes no time and says, ""Let the executions begin!"" But instead, we're left tied up and waiting for anything good for about an hour and a half. 

It's a good scene. Until Obi-Wan and Anakin get their light sabers. I when they're put in situations where they have to use their brains and muscles and not just rely on a lazer sword to cut their way out of everything. 

Then the clones arrive, Samuel L. Jackson kills Jengo Fett, and there's a short fight in the arena. 

I wish Peter Jackson had made his Lord of the Rings trilogy like a year or two earlier, because I feel like George Lucas could have benefitted from seeing the Battle of Hornburg in The Two Towers. That movie came out just a few months after Attack of the Clones. 

And while Two Towers definitely had its dry moments and was the weakest of the three, it made up for it with that great and epic battle that took up a huge chunk at the end. It made the wait worth it, and made the overall movie that much better. 

But in Attack of the Clones, the clones attacking isn't even the climax. It's just one short scene that just happens to exist in a movie of nothingness. Instead, the climax is Dukoo fighting . . . Master Yoda? 

That's all folks!

It just gets cartoony, and definitely played out to get a laugh more than intrigue. The one cool part, I will say thought, is when Yoda pushes his robe aside and his light saber flies to his hand. I thought that was stylish, but anyone could have done that. 

And while he's doing his Bugs Bunny tricks, Obi-Wan and Anakin are just cuddling up together on the ground in the corner. In any other action scene, they would have been right back up on their feet. 

But, you know. The script says ""Stay put."" 

I mean, what's the point of making Yoda the hero here? What does that benefit the story? I just don't get it. We don't even hear Anakin express pain from losing his hand. Remember when Luke lost his hand? Man, he was in pain!

""That's impossible!""

So where does this rank compared to The Phantom Menace? It's like my Casper vs. Hocus Pocus review. It's not a matter of which one is better. It's a matter of which one is worse. Which makes me ask the question, which one has the most unforgivable flaws? 

The Phantom Menace has two very big flaws working against it, and that's Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd. As I stated, if you take those two elements out, you're left with a decent movie.

And Attack of the Clones is The Phantom Menace, without those two flaws. But I feel like they took out the dirty pennies and replaced them with dirty quarters. Attack of the Clones has worse flaws, I think, than The Phantom Menace. And those flaws are the acting by Hayden Christianson, the script and directing by George Lucas. And there's also just no logic throughout this movie at all. Sending Anakin to protect the senator as his first mission? No. Like, that's pretty much the foundation of this movie and that foundation is nothing but rough and coarse sand that will hold nothing up. 

Natalie Portman stepped up her game, and Ewan McGregor is as charming as he's allowed to be. But there are just too many scenes that don't advance the story, and are just stale and stagnant and honestly just a terrible waste of time. 

So knowing how bad both movies are, which one at least entertained me the most? Mind you, entertainment doesn't necessarily mean fun and exciting and happy feelings. Bad movies can still entertain, even though they're bad. 

The underwater scene in The Phantom Menace entertained me, even though it was pointless. Watching Anakin and Padme roll around in the grass did not entertain me. The light saber fight with Darth Maul entertained me because there were stakes and the force walls were a good element. The light saber scenes with Dukoo did not entertain me, they annoyed me. 

Outside of the Darth Maul fight, I will say that the action scenes in Attack of the Clones are a big step up from The Phantom Menace, but if you took those out, you're left with a whole lot of nobodies doing a whole lot of nothing. 

So I shocked even myself, when I put Attack of the Clones underneath Phantom Menace, making it the worst Star Wars movie on my very short list of Star Wars films that I've reviewed. But the list will keep growing as I continue reviewing each film in the franchise leading up to the release of The Rise of Skywalker. "
"Oct 22, 2019",1,Why can't they just make a good Star Wars Film?
"Oct 22, 2019",3,"The prequels are much maligned in some quarters and its easy to see why- They look fake and glossy, and nowhere is it as apparent as it is in Attack of the Clones. Another problem here is that this movie suffers from ""middle episode syndrome"" - the tendency of the second volume in a trilogy to feel incomplete and, as a result of that incompleteness, to fail to satisfy. Attack of the Clones takes the threadbare strands of plot introduced in The Phantom Menace and braids them together into what will eventually become the whole cloth for Revenge of the Sith. Still, despite several high-octane action sequences, this movie, more than any of the others in the entire Star Wars saga, feels orphaned and works considerably better when viewed as part of a greater epic than as a stand-alone production. It's setup without resolution, tease without consummation. But in order to watch the epic it must be seen. "
"Oct 20, 2019",5,"The best film in the Skywalker saga in my opinion. Plot is perfect, the world is spot on. Ewan McGregor's acting is great too. But the action scenes are the best."
"Oct 20, 2019",3,"I thought it was alright, it had good action but everything else was just meh"
"Oct 14, 2019",5,great under rated movie love it great romance really good acting fun story line just so much to enjoy.
"Oct 11, 2019",3.5,"Coruscant is beautiful and multi cultural, you end up wanting to visit there. Incredible special effects, excellent ending and compelling universe. George knows how to expand and create an universe we can dive in"
"Oct 06, 2019",3,Jango fett was cool.
"Oct 06, 2019",2.5,One of the most boring star wars movies ever
"Sep 28, 2019",3,Easily my least favorite prequel of the Star Wars saga. The acting flat out was awful often and the character development was cringe worthy and kinda creepy. I would still recommend this film for the full Star Wars experience.
"Sep 28, 2019",4,The best pre-queal of Star Wars ever.
"Sep 26, 2019",4,"A fun inclusion to the Star Wars universe, even if the dialogue wasn't brilliant."
"Sep 26, 2019",3,"Some of the choices made in this movie is comparison to TPM are questionable. The only above average main characters are Obi-Wan (who is by far the best), Jango &amp; Boba Fett and Yoda. Dooku and Windu are decent and Palpatine still isn't really worth mentioning until the next episode. The pacing is just plain weird and for most of the film's second act the story is insanely boring. Fortunately, Jar-Jar has a much less important role in this film and while he's on the screen, he's not as annoying as he used to be. The absolute lowest this movie comes is in terms of it's infamous love sub-plot between Anakin &amp; Padmé as well as... well, let's just say, 'I don't like sand'. Literally the worst sentence to ever enter George Lucas' train of thought.

This movie is definitely saved by it's stunning visuals and everything that Obi-Wan does. I honestly reckon that if this film was half the size and purely centred around Obi-Wan it would probably be better. The clone sub-plot with Jango Fett is excellent and I appreciate seeing a bounty hunter character who isn't just 'there'. Yoda's agility and fighting style against Dooku was also a good subversion of expectations and I find it hilarious that he just goes back to the cane right after."
"Sep 23, 2019",4,"This film is amazing. While sometimes boring, it has great moments. The sandstorm on Geonosis, the fight between Count Dooku and yoda. The majority of this film is packed with action, and drama. I recommend this film."
"Sep 21, 2019",0.5,I've never laughed as hard as when I saw Yoda fighting with a Light Saber. He looked like an extremely hyped up rag doll. That was all I remembered about this film. A true insult to the original films. It's only saving grace was when the credits rolled. 
"Sep 18, 2019",3,Slow moving but faithful to the concepts of the franchise.  Interesting to see the story of Anakin and how he became ‘you know who'.  
"Sep 18, 2019",4,"It is a good Star Wars movie. Not as good as Revenge of the Sith, but still a great movie. Also, if it's not evident that Jar Jar is a Sith, I'm pretty sure Palpatine is somehow controlling him, because it is amazing seeing what George wanted so long in this movie showing Palpatine's evil side and the Senate corruption, and how Jar Jar is involved. The CGI does leave something to be desired."
"Sep 16, 2019",2.5,"With a slow-moving plot, some real cringey screen-writing, and static characters, Attack Of The Clones is quite simply the worst Star Wars film of the Skywalker Saga. What should have been a step in the right direction after The Phantom Menace, is a disappointment even in the eyes of one of the most devoted fans such as myself. I really put some considerable effort at finishing this movie — something I never have to do when watching other Star Wars films during my spare time."
"Sep 15, 2019",3.5,"A huge improvement on episode 1 as there's less Jar Jar. However, some of Anakin's dialogue is cringey as hell."
"Sep 14, 2019",3,"While it certainly adds to the worldbuilding of the franchise, it has at its core a wooden love story and rather shaky plot development, not to mention spending far too much time on politics - which ironically still manages to fail at explaining properly the roles of the parties and how all this ties together. Credit still has to be given where its due, however, and the film does manage to further the tragedy of its central character well enough, with a healthy dose of irony on the side, but juggles way too many subplots that it ultimately becomes rather painful to sit through."
"Sep 13, 2019",3.5,Not a good dialogue but a fun movie in the end the good visuals help a lot in this one
"Sep 12, 2019",3.5,"There are three aspects that make Attack of the Clones work. The first is Obi Wan, or rather McGregor's interpretation of the character. No longer relegated as side character, Obi Wan is given full rein with a gutsy performance by McGregor who injects blunt and energetic traits, whilst bringing a sense of mysticism. The central character holds the film together in a way that Liam Neeson could not accomplish in the first prequel. It was without doubt that McGregor was not a good choice for such a monumental role. However, here he proves he can equal Sir Alec Guinness, whilst relishing his extended screen time. The second outstanding coup for this film is Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. He is the mastermind of the Separatists, who manipulates everyone in accordance with his secret agenda. Once again Lee proves he is an expert in depicting sinister villains. His performance and screen presence adds much-needed villainy to the film and makes him a formidable opponent for the Jedi to defeat. Thirdly, special effects fans will rejoice with this latest offering. Yoda has now been given a lease of life as a digital character that moves fluidly and with grace. He is probably one of the most important characters in Lucas' Space Opera and this time around, we get to see him flex some serious Jedi muscle. The highly charged and perhaps, laughable confrontation scene between Yoda and Dooku, produces possibly one of the most memorable sequences in the entire prequel saga. This was George Lucas' wild card, which he springs on the audience in a rousing climactic finale.

Additional positive points must also go to Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), who intrigues as the ruthless no-nonsense bounty hunter. Special mention goes to John Williams, who creates arguably his best symphonic piece for a Star Wars movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back'. The main romantic arrangement is a haunting melody that captures the tragic and forbidden love affair of Anakin and Padme. The soundtrack represents a spellbinding amalgamation of new and old themes, which have spanned the entire saga.

Unfortunately, Episode 2 is not all good. Glaring flaws in this otherwise entertaining film do jar the experience somewhat. The pivotal love story is laboured at best. Christensen and Portman show good on-screen chemistry. Some awkward dialogue fails to ignite any emotion that exists between the two leads. Anakin's romantic gush has all the subtlety of a Wookie and will probably leave the audience cleaning out schmaltzy goo from their ears! It is at these moments when you wish that another better writer was at hand to pencil in some dialogue resembling the witty flirty exchanges between Han Solo and Princess Leia in 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Hayden Christensen is a superbly talented actor, but here he plays the teenage angst role by the book. Portman is the biggest disappointment. Despite being given a more dramatic role and ditching the monotonous vocal tones of Queen of Naboo, she still appears wooden. Lucas has a tendency to hopelessly underuse some of the acting talents on hand. Even the Emmy award winner and veteran NYPD Blue actor, Jimmy Smits, as Bail Organa, has fewer lines than Jar Jar Binks! Also, Oscar-nominated Samuel L Jackson as Jedi Master Mace Windu, says nothing much of substance again but does get to see lightsaber combat this time to please the fans.

Episode 2 still lacks the innovation of the original Star Wars, whilst failing to emulate much of the dark edgy tension of Empire (perhaps this is because we know most of the characters will survive through to the next film). However, the grandiose vision of Episode 2 does live up to the expectations associated with the saga and its relentless action guarantees a worthwhile cinematic Star Wars experience."
"Sep 11, 2019",4,"With the  love scenes with creepy Anakin picking up Padme aside, this movie still has some really good action, and the introduction of the character ""Count Dooku"" alone makes it worth the watch. This is also the first time we ever see Yoda in action fighting, and it really was a great moment."
"Sep 08, 2019",5,"I Love this movie, I know many regard this as the worst Star Wars, but I enjoy it. "
"Sep 08, 2019",1.5,"Wooden acting, an overabundance of effects, and more of the same in terms of boring story, this film has nothing of note to truly mention. Definitely the worst of the series."
"Sep 08, 2019",5,Scope of galaxy is really felt and this start Anakin's path to darkness. He fought and hated himself after his revenge on Tuskens. Dooku and Obi Wan dialogue was awesome and also Obi Wan and jango. CGI looks excellent and I love wide documentary shots. Not like today when camera must show scene from many angles just to have something happening. Last act is best in Star wars history.
"Sep 06, 2019",2.5,Bad dialogue. Bad chemistry. Bad CGI. average direction.. but its still star wars
"Sep 06, 2019",3,"One of the visible improvements is the change of Jake Lloyd by Hayden Christensen as Anakin, which brings more maturity to the plot. There's a lot more action in this installment, and the special effects are sublime, as usual."
"Sep 05, 2019",4,Not as strong as the Phantom Menace it draws heavily from works like Dr. Zhivago it can be a little slow. Still it does further the adventures of Anakin Skywalker and his friend Obi-Wan Kenobi as discussed back in 1977 in the original Star Wars. A must see.
"Sep 04, 2019",3,"The only good thing about this flim was the obi wan vs jango fett fight, and the jedi vs droids at the end. The love story between anakin and padme felt really odd to me. and Jango was kiled of WAY TO EARLY LIKE COME ON. I honestly could of wrote a few things a  lot better, but over all I liked the flim enough. "
"Sep 04, 2019",2.5,"The film was wasted opportunity to see create an origin for clone wars. The screenplay and the story was weak with some unnecessary subplot and bad dialogues. Some performence were great like Ewan Mcgregor and Ian Mcdairmid but other performences were horrible. The film's overuse of CGI made the film confusing. The film is also tiresome to seat through till the end with its 142 minutes runtime, the film tends to drag alot (like the romantic scenes of Anakin and Padme). The politics in the film were dull. The film does not feels like a Star Wars film but a mix of detective and dark romance. The film has some good things in it but overall the film is bad or average at best."
"Sep 03, 2019",2,"Slow, dull acted, and full of plot holes, Attack of the Clones falls flat despite it's thrilling action."
"Sep 02, 2019",3,It was an okay film. 
"Aug 29, 2019",3.5,The prequels do get better as they go on. Dialogue is still the main issue and overuse of CGI but still some very memorable sequences.
"Aug 23, 2019",2.5,I hate the romantic Scene
"Aug 23, 2019",3,Meh.... it set the story..
"Aug 21, 2019",5,Epic huge story how sith play both sides to make war and rise of Palpatine. Jedi was unprepared to face fight and they won only because Dooku let them win so that war can continue and Palpatine get more and more power
"Aug 20, 2019",3,"tar Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones benefits from an increased emphasis on thrilling action, although they're once again undercut by ponderous plot points and underdeveloped characters."
"Aug 18, 2019",3.5,"Lucas brings us a sci fi epic, pure entertainment from the beginning to the end."
"Aug 18, 2019",4,The prequel built Anakin's Character.
"Aug 13, 2019",5,"Great movie and shows what happen when global power created by many different nations get army that would ensure that no one leaves union. Same with today in EU with their army. Nations should have armies, not supernational entities. Lucas was smart enough to see treat of global army."
"Aug 11, 2019",3,"A slight improvement on the Phantom Menace, with some great action scenes and visuals, but the whole thing is brought down by that tedious ROMANCE. It is so bad that next time I watch it I will skip every time. Plus, Hayden Christensen is very miscast. Through, as I said, some great action and the visual effects make every set look great, particularly Kamino.  But this is still hard think this belongs in the same saga as the Empire Strikes Back.   "
"Aug 11, 2019",5,"Love how this movie is colorful, not like disney's fan fiction where is all grey. If peoples try to understand plot, this movie woild be their favorite. CGI looks awesome and Corridor Crew showed that in their video. Geonosys, Coruscant, Kamino and clone army in action looks great and feel great. Finally many Jedi in screen in battle."
"Aug 11, 2019",0.5,"Horrible writing, directing and acting. GARBAGE!!!"
"Aug 10, 2019",5,Great movie and continuation of great adventure that ep1 started. 
"Aug 10, 2019",5,"Nothing bad about this movie
Galaxy was great, Palpatine was awesome, Jedi hiding informations from senate how their ability to use force diminish, Many jedi in action and huge ground battle.
Sith mastefully create conflict and forced republic to use army that Jedi think its was made by Jedi master Sifo Dyas. If they didn't use army, separatist would defeat Jedi so republic was never left with much choices.
Anakin acted as anyone in his years wouild if was raised in temple by monks who teach no family or attachments
Hayden is unsung hero because no one else would be able to play Anakin so well."
"Aug 09, 2019",0.5,"Everyone says The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie. No, attack of the clones is the worst in my book. The CGI in this movie is awful; its so horrifically noticeable, and it just looks unappealing. The acting (oh lord) is also really bad, but i dont blame the actors. I blame the hilariocity that is the script. Everything that comes out of their mouths sounds incredibly stupid and cheesy. The chemistry between anakin and padme was about as convincing as pizza and grape jelly going together. Exactly, there is no chemistry. And anakin annoyed the living shit out of me in this movie by being an entitled and ungrateful brat for the entire runtime. Honest to god, i want to like this movie, but i cant"
"Aug 08, 2019",0.5,"Zero stars
Give up! This trilogy is a disaster! "
"Aug 03, 2019",5,"A fantastic adventure into a galaxy far, far away, combined with Lucas's direction, the script he co-wrote with Hales, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Tattersall's cinematography, Burtt's editing, Bocquet's production, Walpole's set decoration, Biggar's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, Attack Of The Clones is a fun and rousing Star Wars adventure!"
"Aug 02, 2019",0.5,By far the worst Star Wars film of the Skywalker saga. Christensen and Portman have about as much chemistry as a celery and a rubber duck. Just don't watch this movie. 1/10.
"Aug 01, 2019",2.5,"""Attack of the Clones"" passes because of Ewan McGregor's performance and visually thrilling action sequences, but with a built-in audience, it could have strived for more than lackluster dialogue and ridiculous plot development with a dreadful romance between Padme and Anakin."
"Aug 01, 2019",4,It's a good Star Wars movie but the Anakin and Padmé scenes are ruining the whole movie
"Jul 31, 2019",3,"Attack of the Clones is slightly better than The Phantom Menace, but it's still not a great film. Hayden Christensen is well-cast as Anakin, the problem is his dialogue and the way George Lucas directs him. The romance in this movie is awful. Anakin and Padme have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. While this movie has plenty of flaws, there is some really good action in it, including Obi-Wan's fight against Jango Fett and the Battle of Geonosis. Also, Christopher Lee is incredible as Count Dooku. B- 65/100 "
"Jul 31, 2019",5,"Decent, but i love jango fett!"
"Jul 28, 2019",0.5,This movie was horrible it was boring the characters were uninteresting and if people think the phantom menace was bad this is worse!!! PS CGI sucked
"Jul 25, 2019",2.5,Their are some glaring plot points that down right confusing.
"Jul 23, 2019",2,Attack of the Clones has it moments but overall this is not a good movie. The script is absolutely terrible and the visuals don't hold up either. Like i said it has some good scenes like in the Arena but that's about it.
"Jul 21, 2019",3,Some bad parts but overall enjoyable. 
"Jul 21, 2019",4.5,Phenomenal set up for the major events of the Clone Wars with impactful develt for Anakin that sets up his development and grows the world building to a major scale
"Jul 21, 2019",5,I don't like Sand
"Jul 21, 2019",2.5,The weakest movie out of the weakest trilogy.
"Jul 18, 2019",4,"This was a good film with an amazing storyline. I really liked how the film has fast paced actions sequences mixed in with a great plot. A negative was how Anakins character was mishandled. He wasn't a character that you would be attached to as he was always whiny. Anakin should have been more Jedi like. The connection between him and Obi wan should have been stronger. The Romance in the story was at some points cringe but overall it wasn't terrible. The music was amazing and the scene with Anakin experiencing the dark side for the first time could not have been better. I just wish it was longer. This movie had the most potential out of any Star Wars movie as this was the time where the Jedi were at their highest peak, Anakin and Obi Wan side by side, Anakin's romance with Padme, Anakins first time experiencing the dark side, The start of the Clone Wars and so much more. Anakin was a character that had loads and loads of potential but fell flat. It wasn't a bad movie by any means but just missed out on certain aspects that would have made this movie potentially legendary!  I rated this movie as a good movie despite the missed opportunities because it delivered on its action packed scenes. The villains in this movie were good and the mystery and suspense was greatly portrayed. This movie was a good movie and was on par with a Star Wars movie but it had Great potential with the characters that the movie simply missed out on. "
"Jul 15, 2019",3,"While the first film was a disappointment at least it was a little fun. This film tries to be more serious in tone, but comes across as boring and dull. The first and last acts are a lot of fun and action packed, but the middle drags and feels longer than it actually is. McGregor, Jackson, Oz, Morrison, and Lee are the best performers in the film, the effects are good but feel more dated even compared to the first film. Christiansen is really disappointing as Anakin, sometimes he feels like he's doing a good job the rest, well let's just say he doesn't like sand. Portman feels like she's phoning it in but is still being professional about it. All in all the film is a lot like Episode I, it has its moments but overall underwhelming."
"Jul 15, 2019",1.5,Although this film has less jar jar it still suffers from terrible performances especially from Hayden Christensen a terrible story that makes little to no sense and even worse dialogue and even though the fight scenes are better with the exception of Yoda versus count dooku I believe that this film is worse then the phantom menace and gets a 3/10
"Jul 14, 2019",0.5,The Young Indiana Jones tv series should have been the warning where this Star Wars film was going to go. Ewan McGregor as always a bad casting decision.
"Jul 13, 2019",2.5,"People usually say this is a better movie than Ep 1, I'm inclined to disagree, this is the worst movie in the entire franchise in my honest opinion. "
"Jul 12, 2019",3,"Definitely not the greatest in this immensely good saga, but it adds on the lore in a pretty efficient way. I'll try to remain spoiler free. Aside from the pretty poorly handled romance and the dialogues with Anakin in general, plus some dumb moments like the ""Arena"" with the three monsters, we have an overall pretty well crafted scenario. We have our first all-out fight with Jedis, witness the creation of an army able to match the droids in terms of number (and which outmatches it in terms of efficiency), and see the main characters grow a bit. The main antagonist of the saga starts putting his plan into place, while letting the protagonists fight a much more visible ennemy. Lucas manage to make his main story advance slowly while entertaining us with enough action and drama to keep us interested."
"Jul 08, 2019",5,Lucas masterfully created new universe not like Star Wars of today that was buildt only of nostalgia. Lucas had this story long in his mind and he has done his wish filming them. Awesome work.
"Jul 08, 2019",2,What has Lucas done to Star Wars?! Is he just adding more to this franchise that does not relate to the original trilogy?
"Jul 03, 2019",5,"While certainly lacking a deeper character development, this film continues the Star Wars saga with new interesting characters, a nice plot full of action and intrigue, an amazing soundtrack, and superb visual effects."
"Jul 03, 2019",5,Middle of story Lucas always wanted to tell. Most plot heavy movie of all SW and marks Palpatine rise to power with emergency powers as point of no return. Blindness and arrogance of Jedi etc...This movie because of story was far most important than entire OT
"Jul 03, 2019",4,"Great action and interesting detective story on the one side and cheesy love story on the other. Some 
overuse of cgi, bad acting and overly dramatic romantic plot might deter people from the otherwise solid story."
"Jun 30, 2019",2,"This film plods along. Not with a good pace, but so many obstacles trying to divert your attention. So, what do we got. We know whose behind the plot at the beginning. As if we needed that for the running time. We are given a love story. Which is torture to watch. We are given real life people in front of digital artists, and it looks very dumb. It goes for over two hours and twenty minutes of actors delivery of lines. It seemed like they had an idea and ran with it. But they didn't focus on any of that. They shot it quickly and I think it was left for digital artists only. There was probably a good twenty minutes of fight scenes, and no one else. The protagonist, you basically wanted him to shut up. But, all in all, half was good, half was bad, and none of the jokes landed. I would have to say, this is the worst out of the franchise. Some say Episode 1 is bad. But 2? I would have rather watch the pod race scene than any of the dialogue with Padme and Anakin any day."
"Jun 17, 2019",2.5,"The action is better and Lucas's team learned from their overuse of comic relief, yet the seemingly-lazy dialogue falls flat, spoiling a love story that already feels forced. "
"Jun 11, 2019",3.5,"Don't get me wrong I like the prequels but this is easily the worst out of them.  There are good parts to this movie and really bad parts.  For starters the romance between Anakin and Padme is awfully acted but to be fair no one could make the bad dialogue work; there is little to no chemistry between them and they take up the majority of the film.  Hayden Christensen at the start of the movie wasn't as bad as I remembered him, he actually reminded me of Anakin Skywalker with some of his lines like, ""You know me master I couldn't find a speeder I really liked,""  but as soon as he and Padme got to Naboo I remembered why he was so bad.  On the other hand Obi-Wan's side of the story is actually really entertaining and if the entire movie was devoted to this I would have liked it a whole lot more, Obi-Wan even meets Jango Fett one of the coolest characters in the entire Star Wars galaxy.  The final battle where all of the heroes are on Geonosis is very fun and as a kid it was the part of the film that I lived for.  Star Wars Episode II, Attack Of The Clones is still a mixed bag for me but I did enjoy it more than I did the last time I watched it."
"Jun 07, 2019",4.5,People don’t understand the complicity of this movie and thats why they don’t like it. But once you do it will probably turn into your favorite star wars movie 
"Jun 06, 2019",5,"Along with ep1, only movie that looks like Old Republic. Seeing many jedi is something i wanted since i learned about Star Wars. Slave ! was awesome ship and asteroid scene was one of best ever in movie history"
"Jun 05, 2019",1.5,I slaughtered them like animals
"Jun 03, 2019",5,Best final act of all Star Wars. Anakin on Tatooine again and Obi wan on Kamino was great buildup for story and characters.
"Jun 03, 2019",0.5,Fell asleep halfway through 
"Jun 01, 2019",5,CGI was insane for that age and still hold today. Plot of Palpatine being puppet master and Anakin first step into darkness was excellent made.
"May 31, 2019",5,"Best buildup for ending and finale was just awesome. 
Jango Fett and Obi Wan fight and chase scene is best visual and sound experience in all of Star wars"
"May 30, 2019",5,The film does a good job setting up the main plot that leads to the original trilogy. The middle of the film feels a bit sappy with the romance but the last sequence of the film more than makes up for it. 
"May 27, 2019",5,"I watched this movie last night. I remember it being really bad but after watching through the whole prequel trilogy again, a lot of the acting and plot makes sense. I think Hayden Christensan as Anakin Skywalker was able to play the torn Jedi Padawan really well and made the entire experience quite fun."
"May 26, 2019",0.5,"Easily the worst Star Wars movie. Period. The CGI aged horribly, the acting is pretty bad (especially Hayden Christensen), its story is very confusing and of course the romance between Anakin and Padme is one of the worst love stories ever. The only good thing is the Jedi Battle in Geonosis, that scene elevates the movie a bit for me. But i would say stay away from this movie; this is a kick in the balls for Star Wars fans...

5/100"
"May 19, 2019",5,"Since Palpatine is in office, republic is like dictatorship and Palpatine said that he won't allow that republic split into two making fertile groung for war. Separatist build their army and Palpatine and Dooku created Clone army and  hide locfation of Kamino till time come when Jedi won't have option and will have to use clone army Dooku created. Jedi didn't have reason to be suspicious to Clone army too much because as Obi Wan told them, Jedi master Sifo Dyas ordered that army for republic and that army was only thing that could help them to won against separatist. Also Jedi went on Geonsis to stop Dooku and separatist alliance. Dooku ordered Tusken raiders to kidnapp Anakin's mother so that Anakin have his premonitions and knowsomething is wrong and Jedi didn't allow him to see what is wrong.Jedi are responsible for Anakin first step into darkness when he killed entire tribe of tuskens.

I loved many Jedi in action, and ground fight on Geonosys. It actually shows that Jedi have not fought war in thousand years and are unprepared. Sith never planned to attack them head on but to turn republic from inside and make that republic hate them. 
Coruscant and Kamino and Geonosys were all extremly well created places.
Fight and chase scene between Obi wan and Jango was awesome and Slave 1 showed that its superb ship.
Clone army marching in their ships and going on battlefields across galaxy was excellent scene showing that there is no turning back. Palpatine has done what he has planned.ï»¿"
"May 15, 2019",1,"Good actors, good music, bad plot. It was filled with unnecessary romance talk and cheap deaths."
"May 05, 2019",3,"without the cringe romance from Hayden Christensen It's a great, fun film. the CGI was pushed to much is many scenes but the whole Clone's and Jango Fett left me happy"
"May 04, 2019",2,"While it's much better paced than The Phantom Menace, and boasts (slightly) better effects, Attack of the Clones still fails due to extremely poor characterization and dialogue. None of this is any more true than with the romance between Anakin and Padme."
"May 04, 2019",0.5,"This is now the 4th time I've seen Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones and for some reason I forgot how bad it really was.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones Is the 5th Star Wars film and the 2nd Star Wars prequel. The film was directed by George Lucas the same man who once directed A New Hope (wha thappened). The film stars Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker and Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi.

The acting is some of the worst in the Star Wars universe from the emotion to the dialogue delivery. The only person in the entire film who I felt fit their role was Christopher Lee as Count Dooku.

The characters/character arcs are also some of the worst within the Star Wars universe from teenager Anakin to Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala. The only character that wasn't a complete train wreck in my opinion was Count Dooku.

The cinematography was steady with a cool shot here and there, but like Phantom Menace nothing special.

The settings are also some of the worst and most bland from the Star Wars universe that I have ever seen. 

The set designs, props, and costumes are strong, but even if it was the best set and costume designs ever it would still be one of the worst films ever made.

The special effects are extremely dated and are some of the most unpleasant effects to look upon.

The action is weak throughout nearly the entire movie from the effects to the cinematography. The only fight that didn't make me feel sick was the first half of the final fight with Anakin and Dooku.

The music was the only thing that kept me alive whilst watching the movie. I just want to thank John Williams for his amazing skill that even works with an atrocious film like this.

The story in my opinion was really bland and super uninteresting. 

The comedy is also some of the worst that Star Wars have ever done. Not once did I laugh and to make things worse I didn't just dislike the comedy, I hated it.

Also For some reason the film has a budget of $120,000,000. How the hell did this film get a budget of $120,000,000.

The film is also one of the most boring films that I have ever seen.

Over all I give it a

"May 03, 2019",0.5,"This movie is complete garbage. I cannot think of a single good thing about this movie, I hate that this is a real part of this franchise and an important part too. A very bad film."
"Apr 27, 2019",2,"Focuses too much on a love story with almost no chemistry. Actors need direction but don't get any. A lot of wasted potential among a multitude of actors and stories that could be told. The final action sequence is well choreographed enough as to not be boring but is mostly dumb if the viewer thinks about it for more than a second. The main plot and subplot are both incredibly boring, luckily John Williams' music is there for you to still feel comfortable and enjoy the movie enough."
"Apr 26, 2019",2,"By far the weakest movie in the “Star Wars” franchise, Episode II had potential that was sadly overshadowed by awkward writing and performances, as well as too much of a dependency on CGI. "
"Apr 26, 2019",1.5,I don't like sand... or this movie.
"Apr 20, 2019",3,"The romance. It's so often criticised, and I can understand why of course. This is not a very normal romance.
But I think, maybe, a gut feeling, that Lucas was deliberately intending for this romance to feel a bit weird and unusual. 
These are two people who absolutely know they shouldnt be getting intinate with each other. Anakin clearly does feel a strong attachment to Padme and Padme for a while sorts of fights off these advances but doesn't turn away completely, proving to Anakin that she also feels some sort of attachment to him.
The key scene is the one where Anakin reveals that he killed the Tuskens, including children and women. Padme actually  feels even more attached to Anakin after this and, sort of confirms to the audience what a flawed and dangerous relationship this is. Padme is drawn into Anakins heart by his darker personality and she must know that. 
Love is very powerful and it can come about in strange a surprising ways.
Fans might not like the acting, may not like the tone or the actors, but this is really not a farfetched romance as depicted in this film. Vader didn't just become Vader, it was a process that actually erupts to another level once Padme embraces him for his darker side."
"Apr 19, 2019",5,Master Yoda fighting for the first time in Star Wars saga! His fight vs Dooku is legendary.
"Apr 18, 2019",1.5,Tied with I for stinkiness and horrible name
"Apr 17, 2019",1.5,"second worst Episode after The last Jedi. just the fight of Geonosis is enjoyable, the rest is either boring or awkward. At least it extended the Star Wars Saga to some degree."
"Apr 15, 2019",2,One of the lesser episodes of the saga. Dull and a boring. I wish the acting was more appealing for one of the best villains in history.
"Apr 11, 2019",5,Great Film. I love the prquels
"Apr 07, 2019",5,I don't like sand.
"Apr 06, 2019",3.5,One of the better Star wars films.
"Mar 31, 2019",1.5,"A slight improvement over its predecessor, though poorly named, this installment simply expands and convolutes Episode I's directionless storytelling, obsession with spectacle, and cardboard characters. It features one of the worst love-stories of all time, that even an actor of Natalie Portman's talent is incapable of saving. There's no need to watch this movie - it would be best for someone to familiarize themselves with it by reading the plot summary on Wikipedia."
"Mar 31, 2019",4,Exciting and amusing. The romance between Anakin and Padme was a struggle to watch but the Jedi doing their thing and the rising tension and start of the Clone Wars was like watching history. Really liked it.

"Mar 22, 2019",1,This movie is slightly better than The Phantom Menace. That doesn't say much. This movie is still a terrible borefest. Don't even get me started on the horrible nonsensical storytelling and awful acting. Grade: D
"Mar 17, 2019",1.5,"Convoluted plot and cartoony physics, Attack of the Clones ties The Last Jedi as my least liked Star Wars film."

"Feb 15, 2019",2,Space detective Obi Wan it's one of the few good things in the movie. If you delete the romance would be an 8
"Feb 14, 2019",5,"My face sci-fi film
The story showed to the folly of trusting a political side and fighting for it without fixing it's horrid elements, because in the deep dark corners of war someone is playing us all.
It also showed us the lore of Star wars across several worlds and factions. It had wondrous battles, a curious mystery and epic music! The love story was only slightly ruined by the slightly stiff acting of Anakin ."
"Feb 12, 2019",1.5,"Being less enjoyably bad than Episode I did Episode II no favors. The romantic dialogue is awful, and the lore is never explored enough to really justify its existence."
"Feb 08, 2019",4,"Attack of the clones has an impressive plot ,with impressive action sequences . But the original trilogy remains far superior."

"Jan 23, 2019",2.5,"Well, not really good but still far better than The Last Jedi. That's for sure."
"Jan 19, 2019",4.5,"Many people disliked this for the wrong reasons I think.  I absolutely loved this film.  I acknowledge some ackward moments and dry acting, but I really enjoyed the story itself. Anakin coming of age, and falling in love with the girl he met years ago. The pain of missing his mother, only to go back home to find her at the moment she dies. To vow that he would never let something like that happen again which leads to his love and protection of Padme, who he marries.  The love story element really added a whole new depth to things, and I absolutely loved it because you can see how Anakin was always doing things out of protecting those he loved in fear of losing them. Also the rise of power of palpatine who was the mastermind playing both sides in the start of the clone wars.  If you look past some of the moments of dry acting, you can really enjoy this film. Wish it got better reviews overall. Also, visuals were great, new characters were interesting, and really set up for anticipation for the next film."
"Jan 16, 2019",3.5,"It's goofy and it's flashy. It's dialogue falls flat and emotion is badly written. But the world it's written in seemed interesting. I like this film. Its not a well written script but the interesting planets, weapons and people and sound editing are lovely.  For children it's perfect. For adults it's mediocre."
"Jan 15, 2019",5,"Great movie, very very underrated. I loved seeing all the Jedi in battle including Yoda for the first time ever."
"Jan 15, 2019",2,"Despite being a huge fan of the franchise, this did not tick any of my boxes apart from the (expected) jedi fights and character development of Anakin Skywalker!"
"Jan 13, 2019",4,"George Lucus delivers the second installment in the STAR WARS prequel series. ATTACK OF THE CLONES carries on from where THE PHANTOM MENACE left off, and once again delivers. Action, thrills, all-out war and Jedi lightsaber duels are all part of the deal. Not happy? I sure as hell am."
"Jan 12, 2019",4,"Overall plot is fairly well thought out and developed. However, poor dialogue and some stilted performances detracts from the overall result."
"Jan 08, 2019",1.5,Should've followed through with the darth jar jar storyline would've made the movie better than what we got
"Jan 06, 2019",2,Where did Dooku come from.  Shoved in there to account for the void left when the true plans for Jar Jar the Sith were scrapped.  You fucked up.  Should have stuck to the plan.
"Jan 06, 2019",2.5,"In short, this movie is not a very good movie. It has great ideas, but the time management of these ideas and the execution of almost everything makes this one of the worst, if not the worst, Star Wars film ever made. 

First in this movie, the directors begin to move in the right direction in attempting to fix their mistakes in Episode 1 regarding one specific character, Jar Jar Binks. He has a much smaller role in this movie, but in my opinion, they did not go far enough. Thankfully, they rectified this later in Episode 3 by having only one scene with Jar Jar.

Next, the time management in this movie is terrible. They spend much too long focusing on the love story between Anakin and Padme. This would be fine if Star Wars was a franchise about love stories. But I want to see exploding ships and huge space battles, much like the rest of the audience. Also, they only allot a very small amount of time to show the clones in action, despite it being called ""Attack of the Clones."" I would have much rather seen more battles in this movie involving the clones than just the one on Geonosis.

The overall plot of this movie is pretty good, and when you think back to the lore created by it while watching later or earlier movies, you can appreciate it. The backstory for the clones was developed well and when they were actually fighting, I liked it. But because of the execution of what would be good ideas, I have to score it badly."
"Jan 06, 2019",5,I love Anakin Skywalker this film is a 5 star movie

"Jan 05, 2019",5,"Even if this movie is considered bad and it had many flaws, it's still a gem compared to the Disney trash, namely TLJ. The lightsaber duels are amazingly choreographed and the movie respects the general in-universe lore (unlike the sequel trilogy) and does not feel like a blatant cashgrab. Also the meme factor and the fact that this movie has the cheesy feeling to it makes it worth a watch in my eyes. 

Also we find out the fact that will be crucial to the SW universe in general: Anakin does not like sand.

"Jan 03, 2019",3,"This movie is not objectively good but itâ(TM)s far from âterribleâ? or bad in my opinion. The big issue is the romance, and rightfully so, as Amidala and Skywalker donâ(TM)t have much chemistry in most of their scenes. The dialogue given to them is quite clunky and the romance suffers more as a result. However, I did like some scenes with them such as their debate upon politics and how the system should work: I thought the dialogue was decent and both actors had chemistry that I wish was prevalent in the main scenes. A issue that bugs me more than the romance is the overload of CGI, as it really dates the picture. Seriously this movie looks like it was filmed solely in front of a blue screen, and itâ(TM)s a bit distracting for normal conversations to look off. The usage of CGI is fine, and can help simplify the work, but it should be used only when its absolutely necessary. This is far from the end of problems for Attack Of The Clones, but I like to do the unpopular gesture of praising this movie for its merits. I felt that the cast choice was fantastic, with Samuel Jackson, Christopher Lee, Ewan Mcgregor and Natalie Portman. Of all the aforementioned actors Mcgregor steals the show as a near perfect Obi Wan Kenobi, despite having often clunky dialogue. Christopher Lee is good for being Christopher Lee but Count Dooku is probably the least intriguing villain of the franchise up to this point, which is a shame. Samuel Jackson does a good job but his character just sits on his ass throughout the entire movie, which becomes tedious to see after a while. Natalie Portman is a fantastic actress but she is hampered here by poor writing as previously stated, although she does bring a sense of charm to the role and is good when she is partaking in the role of Han Solo, and is a great role model for girls in this film. I also will politely mention that she is by far the most beautiful woman in the Saga, and for that alone I will give her a pass. Hayden Christensen is great when acting facially, but is cringe worthy in most scenes, which is unfortunate because I think he is truly a great actor. The third act of the movie is what the rest should have been and reminded me of the excitement of the Original Trilogy, despite the dated bluescreen. Overall, AOTC is not bad but it suffers from many flaws that barely make it better that Episode 1."
"Jan 03, 2019",5,THE GREATest film of all time
"Dec 31, 2018",2,Trash with cool characters
"Dec 29, 2018",3.5,"In terms of story better than episode 1, nice feel to the larger scale battle"
"Dec 28, 2018",3.5,"Attack of the Clones amazing world-building and original design is overwhelmed and shadowed by its cringeworthy dialogues and out-of-place scenes, but is otherwise a decently entertaining movie if understood under the scope of being just the second entry on a 6-movie storyline."
"Dec 28, 2018",3.5,"It's the worst movie of the Prequels, maybe the entire saga. The writing was horrible and the actors make it worse. The CGI is the worst of the prequels too. There are some good parts like Ian McDiarmids acting and John Williams score. Also I believe Yoda was great too!"
"Dec 27, 2018",1.5,"And I thought Star Wars couldn’t get worse after the Phantom Menace. This movie was even worse than the last one. The only redeemable qualities were Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiarmid, and Samuel L Jackson. Anything to do with Anakin and Padme made me want to claw my eyes out. The lightsaber duel was a huge letdown after the admittedly awesome Duel of the Fates. All I can say is at least things got better after this mess. "
"Dec 27, 2018",3,Interesting but badly done. 
"Dec 19, 2018",1.5,2nd worst SW film. Lucky for Clones TLJ took that crown. 
"Dec 18, 2018",5,"i love this film, its amazing  i dont care what people say about the love stuff in this film, i thought it developed anakins character more, this film is amazing the action was fucking awesome and the cgi improved with jar jar over the previous film im going to give star wars attack of the clones a 5 out of 5 star grade, i love this film, i love the star wars saga and i hate what disney is doing to george lucas's baby, also that duel between yoda and count dooku is amazing"
"Dec 16, 2018",3.5,"EPISODE II has Jedi at their peak, investigating assassination attempts in the biggest city in the galaxy, the planet-city of Coruscant. As the (mildly stilted) forbidden romance between Anakin and Padme blossoms, Obi-Wan reveals a hidden conspiracy that erupts into a rescue and a first conflict to the (legendary) Clone Wars."
"Dec 15, 2018",4,"The weakest of the saga, but still it's star wars."
"Dec 11, 2018",2,Still not good. But better than its predecessor.
"Dec 10, 2018",1,One of my least favorite Star Wars movies
"Dec 10, 2018",4.5,A fitting sequel to a rocky start of a trilogy.
"Dec 09, 2018",1,good duels but not a fan of the poor acting or stalky anakin.
"Dec 08, 2018",1,Just such a boring movie.
"Dec 06, 2018",3.5,A Boring Prequel With Some Great Action Sequences
"Dec 02, 2018",3,"The weakest of the prequels, but still good Star Wars fun for the family. My youngest son adores it. And it does move the story along and gets all of the characters into place."
"Dec 02, 2018",1,"If you thought Phantom Menace was the worst Star Wars movie, just wait til' you see this"
"Dec 01, 2018",2,Nothing else to add that hasn't been said.
"Dec 01, 2018",2,"The second installment in George Lucas' prequels suffers from the same flaws as the first, and perhaps a little more. Once again giving us wondrous and colorful images, though still suffocating us with excessive video game level CGI, and once again delivering a barrage of trite, tin eared dialogue and stiff acting that would make a cardboard cutout more lively than any of these characters. It earns points over ""The Phantom Menace"" for attempting to create a more darker tone, but with so many spots where we find ourselves more bored than enthralled, and giving us perhaps one of the most juvenile romances in cinema history, as a whole, it's another swing and a miss."
"Dec 01, 2018",1,"MY GOD WAS THIS MOVIE PAINFUL! Skip, Go from Movie one to Movie 3. Youll be happy with the 2 hours of your life not wasted."
"Nov 26, 2018",5,Best movie of the saga. Attack of the clones itâ(TM)s my favorite movie of all time
"Nov 25, 2018",2,"The second installment in George Lucas' prequels suffers just the same as ""Phantom Menace."" Lucas phones in directing to focus more time on his CGI smothered world that looks as if you're watching a video game. The film also unsurprisingly suffers from unspeakable dialogue that seems to attempt Shakespearean status but falls incredibly short, sounding stiff and makes tinnitus sound more welcoming to the ears. Which of course results in even more stiff acting and is the film presents arguably the worse on screen romance in recent memory. Like ""Menace,"" it has it's fair share of moments with beautiful images, and the added darkness is welcoming, but it also falls short by being a bit of a bore. Seems that Lucas was using this installment as a simple filler, having no idea which direction to take the story."
"Nov 23, 2018",3,An improvement from the first one.
"Nov 21, 2018",5,I love this movie all the more after seeing the last jedi
"Nov 21, 2018",1.5,"Sadly, as a Star Wars fan, this is my least favorite Star Wars movie out of all the films.  Yes it doesn't have Jar Jar, yes they don't have as much Political squabble, but instead, Attack of the Clones has some of the Cringe worthy romantic dialog i have ever heard in a Star Wars movie, along with an over use of CGI and the worst of all the lightsaber battles!  A D+ is the best i can give this movie."
"Nov 19, 2018",2,"A very bad narrative to drive this poor plot, with a horrible reltionship with bad acting and bad dialogues. And the CGI is not good either, it makes the action less exiting."
"Nov 17, 2018",3,Nice but too slow in some scenes
"Nov 14, 2018",3,Most likely the weakest film in Lucas' prequel trilogy. A good performance by McGregor and wonderful special effects just make this film serviceable.
"Nov 13, 2018",2,"Se pensavate che La Minaccia Fantasma fosse il peggior film di Star Wars... beh, questo per me è ancora peggio. Il peggior film della saga in assoluto, perché non solo è mal fatto, con CGI sovrabbondante, storia incomprensibile e banale, ma ha anche l'elemento peggiore che un film d'intrattenimento può dare: la noia. Questo capitolo è terribilmente noioso, con una sceneggiatura che definire annacquata è un eufemismo, protagonisti insopportabili, dialoghi al limite del ridicolo e non una singola scena che ci si ricordi positivamente. La sensazione alla fine del film è quella di aver contemplato il nulla per due ore, e a niente vale purtroppo la presenza del Conte Dooku, un sacrificatissimo Christopher Lee in uno dei ruoli meno memorabili della sua carriera. Insomma, togliendo la nostalgia e l'affezione che si può avere per la trilogia prequel, 8e togliendo anche l'esistenza di materiale ben più raccapricciante come lo Star Wars Holiday Special), questo è veramente toccare il fondo."
"Nov 11, 2018",2,"The score by John Williams is the best part of Attack of the Clones. The movie itself is just all over the place and does not seem to know what it wants to do with itself. Anakin is more of a complaining teenager than a powerful young Jedi in training, and the plot is always filled with several different things that need to be resolved. Easily the worst of the Lucas-era Star Wars movies."
"Nov 05, 2018",4.5,"Worst one from the prequels but still got some great scenes, yoda fighting being one"
"Nov 01, 2018",2,I don’t like sand...but I like the special effects 
"Oct 30, 2018",2.5,I don't like sand that says it all
"Oct 29, 2018",2,"While it's much better paced than The Phantom Menace, and boasts (slightly) better effects, Attack of the Clones still fails due to extremely poor characterization and dialogue. None of this is any more true than with the romance between Anakin and Padme.

4/10"
"Oct 25, 2018",5,Hayden was perfect for Anakin yes there are some questionable scenes but no movie is perfect very underrated
"Oct 22, 2018",1.5,Just because Jango Fett and Mace Windu are decent characters doesnt mean the rest of the movie is.
"Oct 15, 2018",4,"I didn't mind this, I like Jedi unlike some. Saber fight could of lasted longer."
"Oct 14, 2018",3,"If you're not a fan of Star Wars, you definitely will want to skip this one. Definitely the worst in the entire Star Wars movie collection (Until ep 7) That being said there are still some good to be found in this movie. Ewan Mcgregor as Obi Wan is once again a highlight in this Star Wars Prequel."
"Oct 10, 2018",5,Loved it as a child and still do.
"Oct 08, 2018",4,"Though the love scenes can become tiresome, Star Wars: Attack of the Clones makes up for it by offering amazing battles, awesome villains, and the ever-powerful army of the clones."
"Oct 07, 2018",2,"Worst live-action Star Wars movie. Even worse than Episode I. Episode II suffers from very wooden acting, terrible directing, awful writing, some bad casting, dreadful romance, horrible dialogue, horrific CGI, overused CGI, an over-reliance on visual effects, and a misleading title. Attack of the Clones is set 10 years after The Phantom Menace, but Obi-Wan, Padme, and Windu all look like they've only aged by 3 years. In this movie, Anakin gets recast and is played by Hayden Christensen who did not look like an older version of Jake Lloyd. The prequel trilogy really should have started out with Hayden Christensen as a 15 or 16-year-old Anakin since Episode I.
 It would've made the continuity a lot better. In this movie, all Anakin mostly does is whine and complain about his master Obi-Wan behind his back and talks badly of him behind his back. Anakin is an arrogant, creepy, weird, angst, stubborn, spoiled, bratty, whiny, annoying, immature, impatient, impulsive, ungrateful, and unlikable 19-year-old teenage prick. Padme is a cute, adorable, beautiful, lovely, sexy, sweet, sugary, kind, considerate, warm-hearted, and good-natured 24-year-old woman. One of the biggest things that annoyed me was that she left that annoying, brainless Jar Jar Binks in charge to choose who to grant the emergency power of the Galactic Senate. Much later in the film, he ends up granting Chancellor Palpatine the emergency power of the Galactic Senate.
 So a worthless, stupid, cartoonish annoying, unfunny, racist, slapstick character is the reason for the Galactic Civil War in the original trilogy? (sighs) Oh, and it's revealed in this movie that Anakin doesn't like sand, because according to him ""it's course, rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere"". So Darth Vader's weakness is sand? Is that why Darth Vader wasn't on Tattooine in Episode IV? (sighs) That is just so stupid.
 He literally blatantly tells Padme that when they're on Naboo and she just looks at him like he is the biggest and creepiest weirdo in the galaxy. Anakin is actually so creepy in this movie. Right after his mother dies from being hurt to death by the sand people, he gets angry and avenges his mother's death by slaughtering the sand people that killed her. He even takes his anger out on all the other Tusken Raiders in the village by slaughtering ALL of them including the ones that didn't even hurt, touch, nor kill his mother. He even killed ""the women and the children too"" according to him.
 The next morning, he brings his mother's dead corpse home and Padme sees him carrying the corpse. He admits to murdering all of the Tusken Raiders in the village to Padme. He even admits to her that he even murdered ""not just the men, but the women and the children too"". Padme acts like it's normal and not sociopathic for someone to take their anger out on women and children that weren't involved in killing by murdering them. She responds to him by telling him ""to be angry is to be human"".
 Anakin basically revealed himself as a sociopath in front of Padme and SHE STILL FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIM. How does she fall in love with a whiny, strange, creepy sociopath like him? Anakin and Padme's romance is creepy, awkward, horrible, cringe-worthy, horribly executed, and extremely forced. This movie has one of the worst and most forced love stories ever. It's actually an even worse love story than Twilight.
 What makes it even worse is that Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman have ZERO chemistry in this film. The acting from Christensen and Portman is terrible (not that I blame them, cause it's really Lucas' fault cause of his shitty writing, shitty direction, terrible script, and wooden dialogue). The characters are so poorly written. Another big flaw in this movie that I'd like to point out is that almost every single scene in this movie was filmed using blue screens, and it's painfully obvious too. There is a HUGE continuity error in Episode II. Boba Fett is Polynesian in this prequel.
 Why is young Boba Fett Polynesian? Boba Fett who was physically played by Jeremy Bulloch (who is white) and voiced by Jason Wingreen, was Caucasian and spoke with an American accent in the Star Wars originals, but in this prequel he is Polynesian and speaks with a New Zealander accent. This makes ABSOLUTE ZERO SENSE! Jango Fett should have also been Caucasian in this film. Why did George Lucas cast Daniel Logan as Boba Fett in Attack of the Clones?
 Daniel Logan was severely miscast as Boba Fett and Temeura Morrison was miscast as Jango Fett. George Lucas should have cast a Caucasian American man to play Jango Fett and a Caucasian American boy to play Boba Fett in Attack of the Clones. Also, Boba Fett should not have been a clone in this film. It makes the character feel a LOT less special and ruins his character. Boba should've been Jango's biological son instead of a clone.
 Speaking of clones, why did Lucas make all of the clone troopers CGI instead of getting actual people to play them? The CGI didn't even look good, it looked so fake-looking and horrible. The clone troopers all looked like video game characters. Speaking of video games, the battle of Geonosis scene looked like one big GIGANTIC VIDEO GAME ACTION SEQUENCE. The visuals have aged HORRIBLY.
 The CGI is almost as bad as the CGI in Spy Kids 3: Game Over. In the third act, what the hell was with Yoda using a lightsaber? How was he using a lightsaber and jumping high and far and quickly doing flips in the air when he was in a lightsaber duel against Count Dooku? Isn't Yoda supposed to be physically handicapped and slow because he is extremely super ultra old and is probably the oldest living being in the galaxy? Isn't that why he usually uses a cane?
 In the originals, he was only a Force user and is only a master of the Force. He never used a lightsaber in the originals. So what was the point of Yoda using a cane to walk if he's agile and able to move quickly on his feet and jump high and do flips in the air and is a master of using a lightsaber? Yoda is supposed to be this old, wise master who guides and teaches others and is not a fighter. Much earlier in the film, Anakin even says that Obi-Wan ""is as wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu"".
 This movie is so bad and has aged horribly. The only good things about this movie were the action, Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine, and Christopher Lee as Count Tyrannus Dooku. Those three actors still managed to give pretty good performances with the lousy direction and messy script Lucas wrote. Why is the movie titled 'Attack of the Clones' if the clones only start attacking in the last 10 to 15 minutes of the final act of the movie? It should've been titled ""Shroud of the Dark Side"" (as Yoda says at the end of the movie).
 Star Wars: Episode II - Shroud of the Dark Side would have been the perfect title for this film. George Lucas ruined Anakin Skywalker, Boba Fett, and Yoda.

Rating: 4.4/10"
"Oct 04, 2018",3,"This film overall had so much potential and had all the right pieces but the pacing and lack of good acting and dialogue, film falls short as an epic second piece to the prequel trilogy."
"Oct 04, 2018",4,Has some boring moments but overall good movie
"Oct 02, 2018",3.5,"This is where I wanted the prequels to begin. The ""clone wars"" went in a different direction then I expected. The anikin/padme romance was a bit juvenile and I trouble believing it. This film has the best action scenes of the three prequel movies."
"Sep 29, 2018",3.5,"Star Wars Episode II:Attack Of The Clones is better than the Phantom Menace because it is less boring and has a better storyline that more people can enjoy. It is the worst Star Wars episode in the Skywalker Saga. Ten years after initially meeting, Anakin Skywalker shares a forbidden romance with Padmé Amidala, while Obi-wan Kenobi investigates an assassination attempt on the Senator and discovers a secret clone army crafted for the Jedi.

My only problem with this movie is that the romance between Anakin and Padmé can get very boring at times. The best action scene in the film is the Jedi Battle scene. I loved that Sir Christopher Lee was casted to play the main antagonist in the movie Count Dooku. The film has brilliant visual effects and had great action sequences. It is an enjoyable film for the whole family to enjoy. 

Grade B"
"Sep 28, 2018",1,"This film is, in my opinion, only marginally better than The Phantom Menace.

Ewan McGregor had a larger role as Obi-Wan, and that made significant sections of the film more tolerable.

Any scene that had anything to do with Hayden Christensen was just abysmal. Absolutely horrendous. I don't know if it was the script, or lack of acting ability, but everything about his performance was painful to watch.

The ""romance"" scenes with Padme (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (Hayden Christensen)? The words uncomfortable and slightly creepy come to mind. I don't understand how anyone could watch this film and believe that Padme and Anakin were in love. Or even liked each other.

It's so bizarre.

There is a lot of CGI used in Attack of the Clones, and a lot of it is bad. The use of green screen is incredibly noticeable in many scenes.

The plot makes little sense, though it lends itself to more exciting sequences than that of The Phantom Menace.

Excruciating."
"Sep 24, 2018",2,Slight improvement over The phantom menace but it still has annoying characters and undermines the franchises legacy.
"Sep 22, 2018",2.5,"Much better than the last previous entry, but still dumb."
"Sep 17, 2018",3.5,Not a bad movie but they have too much of a love story in it. This is Star Wars not a romance. Still this is way better than Episode 1. You will want to see it if you loved the original trilogy.
"Sep 17, 2018",2,"A boring plot and bad actor chemistry makes this a Star Wars movie nearly as bad as Rian Johnson's ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi""."
"Sep 12, 2018",1.5,"There's not much to say. There are a few nice action set pieces, but our heroes are unlivable and stupid, the romance is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious in places, and once again the plot relies on everybody being incredibly gullible and/or just completely idiotic."
"Sep 10, 2018",1,"The awful cringe-worthy acting, script is parody worthy of the first. But instead creates a failed performance ruining the Star Wars series all together."
"Sep 10, 2018",1,"While Attack of the Clones is an improvement over its predecessor and still showcases Lucas' imagination, it also showcases that Star Wars can grow stale and have all the appeal of stale leftovers."
"Sep 08, 2018",1.5,Bad this one is. Kamino and the Jango Fett v Kenobi battle is the only memorable scene. Hayden Christenson and Portman have unbearably bad chemistry in one of the most forced love stories in movie history. Christenson is an awful choice for Vader made worse by terrible dialogue and poorly contrived action sequences. The Gladiator pit features atrocious special effects.

"Aug 19, 2018",2.5,"Was passiert wenn man die 3 Mammut Aufgaben für einen Blockbuster alleine lösen muss? Man verliert den Überblick und es endet im Mittelmaß oder noch schlimmer bei der Goldenen Himbeere. Lucas hatt dennoch mit Hilfe des heute nicht mehr so ganz Dreidimensionalem CGI das digitale Kino um Jahre nach vorne getrieben. Dennoch ist die Romanze zwischen der unterforderten Natalie Portman und dem grinsenden Haydn Christensen gescheitert auf Grund mangelnder Vielschichtigkeit. Zu wenig Zeit für richtige Beweggründe der Gefühle. Doch Schauspieler waren ja auch noch genügend da. Evan McGregor zeigt in den Prequilles was für ein Kaliber von Schauspieler er ist, Samuel L jackson spielt solide doch man sieht wenig wie von vielen der Charaktere die interessant sein könnten. Am Ende fällt Episode 2 auch bei vielen wegen der teils grausigen Dialoge, Stichwort Sand. So bleibt Episode 2 im Mittelmaß der Filmgeschichte und auf der Todesliste der Fangeschichte"
"Aug 15, 2018",1,"The Worst Star Wars film, nothing really redeemable in this movie expect that one line about the death sticks."
"Aug 14, 2018",5,Better than The Last jedi and The Force Awakens.
"Aug 12, 2018",1,"The acting is terrible in this movie, and the romance between Anakin and Padme is incredibly forced. The only entertaining part of this movie is the Obi-Wan and Jango Fett fight. Other than young Boba Fett, of course."

"Aug 07, 2018",1.5,"I love Star Wars, I truly do, but this movie is just not good.
Apart from the memorable action sequence in the asteroid field and the arena battle, this movie is filled with cringy dialogue, average performances and badly aged visual effects.
The romance between Anakin and Padme is just not believable enough for me to invest in it. If it wasn't for the Clone Wars and books , I wouldn't understand why Anakin turns evil when she dies in the next one. Spoilers I guess"
"Aug 04, 2018",4,Love the action and clones. Really enjoy the new characters introduced like Jango and Count Dooku.
"Aug 03, 2018",4,Pretty good installment in the Star Wars franchise.
"Aug 03, 2018",5,"Dude....the birth of the clones! Yes....mediocre acting from a couple main stars, and a skosh of cheese....but the darkness and weight of the cloning facility, plus the Death of so many Jedi lends a gravity to this movie that is unparalleled in the live action SW universe. The Fett side plot has ramifications that echo into the original trilogy, as well a the amazing and underrated The Clone Wars Series. Overall.....a horribly underrated addition the the Star Wars live action mythology!"
"Aug 01, 2018",4,Love the final act of this movie. The action is great and the clones are awesome.

"Jul 31, 2018",2,"'I hate sand, it's coarse and rough and it gets everywhere.' Wow, you have to try to be that bad."
"Jul 30, 2018",0.5,"The worst of the prequel trilogy, Attack of the Clones is filled with more CG, even faker than before, hammier performances, the worst of which is Hayden Christensen, and surprisingly worse writing. ""I don't like sand"" will forever go down in film history."
"Jul 29, 2018",3.5,The movie is ok. But if you hated Anakin in episode I he is even worse in episode II.
"Jul 25, 2018",2,"As a child, I loved almost anything Star Wars. I couldn't understand the hate directed by The Phantom Menace, which was one of my favorite movies. I ate up prodigious quantities of tie-in novels of questionable quality. I even collected Star Wars merchandise and memorabilia, buying such items as a Lucasfilm-approved painting of Admiral Ackbar wearing a 19th century French naval officer's uniform and a fast food promo cup with a lid shaped like Jar Jar Binks. Even then, however, I hated Attack of the Clones.

The main problem with Attack of the Clones is the romance around which the film is centered. Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen have no chemistry with each other and neither gives a good performance even when not playing off each other. (I suspect that bad directing is at least partially responsible for this, as I know that Natalie Portman can act.) Furthermore, the writing makes Anakin come off as extremely creepy. Several of his statements over the course of the film should have set off alarm bells in Padme's head, but somehow his whining and creepy advances (not to mention outright murder) cause Padme to fall in love with him.

The film is also a lot slower paced than A New Hope, and I don't think it works in the film's advantage. The slower pace works in The Empire Strikes Back because it allows time for character development. Outside of the awful romance, however, there is little character development in Attack of the Clones. Instead, the extra runtime is spent on galactic politics, exposition, and a Boba Fett origin story which isn't given any sort of proper closure until the spin off Clone Wars cartoon.

To be fair to the people involved in this film, Ewan McGregor does at least give a good performance. Some of the character and ship designs are also cool. A single decent performance and some cool computer models do not make a good film, however, and the only reason I can see to watch this film, besides completionism, is to gain background knowledge for the vastly superior Clone Wars animated series. It speaks to the scale of the missteps made when a computer-animated cartoon does a better job with many of the same plot threads than a $120 million feature film."

"Jul 08, 2018",4,An enjoyable film overall. Really like the last half hour with the battle of Geonosis. The dialogue is a little cringey at times but overall the film is a worthy installment in the Star Wars franchise.
"Jul 08, 2018",4,Very entertaining. The last half hour with the battle of Geonosis was awesome. Dialogue was cringey at times but the story was interesting and we finally got to see the clones.
"Jul 07, 2018",2.5,Worst Star Wars Movie aside from SOLO: A Star Wars
"Jul 05, 2018",2,"To me, ""Attack of the Clones"" is so far the worst cinematic Star Wars film. It doubles down on the problems of its predecessor, making for an even more disappointing and less entertaining experience. A decade after the events of ""The Phantom Menace"", Anakin Skywalker is older now and trains with Obi Wan Kenobi.  The Galactic Republic is threatened once again, this time by a former Jedi Master, Count Dooku, who has organized a Separatist movement. That's as far as you have to know about the plot, even though it does feel like a lot more is happening throughout this film - most of which is hard to recall. It's a slow and quite boring film, which is a crime, because the concept of the prequel trilogy is very interesting. It has several dull moments. Despite the much reduced role of Jar Jar Binks, this film somehow managed to include more cringe inducing moments, most of which are the result of some really unnaturally and weirdly written dialogue. I would say that I found most of the cast more dedicated to their performances than they were in the previous film, particularly the loveable Ewan McGregor. However, the casting of Hayden Christensen in the role of the now 19 year old Anakin Skywalker was simply wrong, because he was creepy in a very uncool way and was unbelievably monotonous in his role; not that his role was a well written one, but still. George Lucas did deliver on the action and the visuals though, even if the latter could have been replaced by a few practical effects. The score was as always captivating. It's not a very bad movie, but it's still pretty bad."
"Jul 01, 2018",5,"There are just some things we took for granted, Like this movie. 
Dont pay for anything soylo a soy wars story."
"Jun 29, 2018",2.5,"Some very cool action sequences, but overall is filled with laughably bad dialogue and predictable plot points."
"Jun 26, 2018",3.5,"Most people say episode 2 is the worst of the franchise but I disagree.  As with all the prequels the dialogue is just plain bad.  The forced romance is also completely unbelievable and is the focus of most people's disdain.  The main story however is very good and has some of the most unique and intriguing characters and locations I've seen in a movie.  The most important part is Christopher Lee is in the film, and he makes everything 10% better by default."
"Jun 26, 2018",3,I really liked how Lucas is doing this... but then again.....
"Jun 26, 2018",4.5,"Underrated prequel film, has the spirit of Star Wars, improved acting over the first but has not aged to well. Some of the effects have become obvious"
"Jun 23, 2018",3.5,"The Battle of Geonosis is visually stunning for its time, but the love relationship between Padme and Anakin is very cringeworthy. Hayden and Natalie do not work well together."
"Jun 21, 2018",4,I really like the plot but anakin's character is pretty cringey during the first half. So much unnatural feeling angst exuding sporadically just seemed weird and distracting.
"Jun 19, 2018",1.5,"Again, so much hate on the prequels but not too much that the prequels give to defend itself. So... yeah. It's a movie at least."
"Jun 18, 2018",4,The final act drags and the CGI has not aged well but the story is still engaging.
"Jun 18, 2018",4,"Well, it came. I saw. I WAS BLOWN AWAY!! Yeah, I am a fan of the Star Wars series, but even I was disappointed in The Phantom Menace. With many of the industry's well-known critics slamming this movie, my expectations began to lower. Yes, I was still excited, but I was preparing myself for another flop-ola. So what happened? I'll tell you what happened. I saw a film that brought back the magic of the first trilogy. I saw a film that never had a dull moment in its 2:30+ in duration. Do you have to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy this movie as much as I did? Maybe, because I cannot understand what these other critics missed. So instead of spoiling the movie by giving away all its twists and turns, this review is for those who saw it, liked it and are confused. This review will be a comparison of reviews from other critics to help give the reader a perspective of the ""type"" of person (in the best way possible) who did not like this movie.

Before we get to the critics, let me make one short statement. Movie critics were not prevalent, as they are now, in 1977 when the first A New Hope was released. Since critics can, at times, be very harsh, I doubt A New Hope would have been the hit it was in 1977 had critics broken it down piece by piece. As dead-on as these critics are sometimes, everyone needs to remembers that they are just critics. They are just giving their opinions. Since most of them are fans of film as an art, they critique films as such and their opinions are derived not from how entertaining the film is, but rather how successful the movie makers artistically expressed the film as a whole via the story, the dialogue, the acting, cinematography, etc. Now, you may be saying, ""uhm, Jeff, all you are doing is giving your opinion. Why should I listen to you?"" Well, good point. But if you will notice, I write my opinions (at least for movies) based on how I would recommend them as entertainment value, specifically for families since I tend to see a lot of family movies with my kids. And in the case of Attack of the Clones, I will be writing and comparing other critics' opinions based on the Star Wars' FAN's point of view, as well as a family recommendation. Either way, I'm not going to get carried away with the ""art"" of Attack as a cinematic masterpiece. In fact, I love that the fact that Attack does not satisfy the artsy-fartsy movie critic, yet is still a FAN's movie and broke $100 million in its first weekend. Since the original Star Wars trilogy was so huge AND had an established fanbase before critics were prevalent, it makes Attack bullet-proof to the critics. Let's remember that fans loathed The Phantom Menace, while many critics like Roger Ebert, gave it a near-perfect rating (see his 1999 review here).

Now onto the critics...

Let's start out with the Grand Pooh-bah of movie critique, Roger Ebert:

First of all, after reading his review of The Phantom Menace, then Attack of the Clones, there were a couple of lines that were hypocritical. 

In the The Phantom Menace review, he wrote, ""The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained ""Julius Caesar."" I wish the ""Star Wars"" characters spoke with more elegance and wit (as Gore Vidal's Greeks and Romans do), but dialogue isn't the point, anyway: These movies are about new things to look at."". 

However, in the Attack review, he wrote, ""But as someone who admired the freshness and energy of the earlier films, I was amazed, at the end of ""Episode II,"" to realize that I had not heard one line of quotable, memorable dialogue."" While at another point he states, ""

Hypocrite...

Frankly, the dialogue in the Star Wars movies has always been a little weak. And, yes, I can completely understand that there is an element missing from this second trilogy so far that is the cynic, the skeptic, like Han Solo was in the first trilogy. However, these movies are pre-destined. We already now the RESULT of these three movies. We want to know HOW it gets there. The Phantom Menace was boring in many aspects (though not really as bad as everyone thought--our expectations would have NEVER been satisfied), but there had to be a start. There had to be a beginning to it all. I'm pretty sure that Lucas could have done a little better, but not much. Building those characters and setting the tone for the future had to be done and with Attack, you can tell why Lucas did what he did. Yes, he eats some crow in the movie by displaying the biggest fan-favorite character, Boba Fett, and limiting Jar-Jar's lines (yet maximizing his impact to the overall storyline). However, Lucas did a superb job in getting the story moving toward where we know it will end up.

Across town from Ebert, the Chicago Tribune gives their version. Mark Caro, who gave Attack 2 stars as Ebert did, writes: ""For such a visually oriented filmmaker, Lucas commits an unpardonable sin: He tells instead of shows.""

I can actually agree with this. While the dialogue did not impress me much, the dialogue is not why I go to Star Wars movies. It's the story. Granted, like The Phantom Menace, Lucas is packing a lot of story into the allotted time, Attack is more exciting, has more interesting twists and, frankly, is setting us up for a what should be an incredible third movie. However, as Caro wrote, to help pack more progress into this film, Lucas does end up ""telling"" a lot without showing the progress in visuals. The exception is when Anakin goes to Tattoine and begins descending to the darkside once finding his mother. The way that part of the story progressed was very visual and lead-up-to via the many references to his recurring bad dreams.

So is it a bad thing that Lucas has to tell us rather than show us? Well, since it does not impact the overall amount of action in this movie, I would say no. Is it different for Lucas? Absolutely, but not necessarily a bad thing. I think Lucas is trying to get himself out of the rut he put himself into by starting the story with Anakin as a child in The Phantom Menace. In the first trilogy, the story seemed to flow better because there were not as many time-delays. Luke was an upper teen in A New Hope and ended as a twenty-something in Return of the Jedi. Lucas should have avoided trying to bring in new children fans and started Anakin out that way as well. 

Mark Caro's co-hort at the Chicago Tribune, Michael Willmington, is more of a fan focusing on the fan's appeal to this movie. He gives the movie 4 stars and writes: ""Nothing in the first four movies quite matches the continuous visual bravura of this one, which is almost as much a digital age marvel as the '77 ""Star Wars"" was of an earlier era of miniatures and models. For most of its 2-hour span, the movie keeps topping itself, not dramatically, but with one pure, explosively delivered, ripely detailed action set-piece after another.""

I could not agree more. When I was a five year old watching A New Hope, my interest in the movie was not because of the intricate storytelling, the relationship of the force to modern religious beliefs, the contrast of Han's cynicism to Luke's desire to believe it all. No, I like how cool the Landspeeder was. Man, it was a FLOATING CAR! And I liked the Millennium Falcon. Hyperdrive was cool!! Lightsabers? AWESOME! And the X-Wing fighters flying through the corridors of the Death Star to find that one little hole that will make it blow up? Oh yeah, baby. THAT was what the movie was about. Carry that interest to The Empire Strikes Back when there were the cool snowspeeders on Hoth, the dual-cabined Cloud Pods on Bespin, Boba Fett's cool costume, Luke and Darth's first encounter, etc. Then carry that yet again into Return of the Jedi, where there is an all-out, free-for-all fight extraordinaire when the second Death Star was going to be destroyed. Have you ever seen so many Tie Fighters?? And those Biker Scouts were cool!!

See what I mean? Ebert had it right when he reviewed Phantom. Dialogue is secondary (if not even LESS important) to the cool visuals, the overall story and the action! Lucas remembered that this time and that is why Attack is so good. Hayden Christensen is an absolutely horrible actor. I thought that throughout the film. But does it ruin it? Not at all. You see more and more of where the story is going. And to top it off, what you THINK is going to happen doesn't. Despite how many trailers were released, you DON'T know what's going to happen. As much as they showed you, you have not prepared yourself for what you will be seeing. 

So go do it...now...many, many, many more times over the summer. Ignore the critics. Go see Attack of the Clones today and form your own opinion. If you are a Star Wars fan, you will love it."
"Jun 18, 2018",1.5,Worst attempt at a love story... ever.... urggghh. Really didn't like how the romantic scenes took place in the story. felt very disturbing and horribly done. And it doesn't help that the CLones only appear for a short amount of time in the film.
"Jun 17, 2018",1.5,"What's up with the dialogue? Whats up with the acting? What's up with the love story?
What's up? This film is just awful. ruins Star Wars completely. Where the quality? It's just a really bad movie. That's all there is."
"Jun 16, 2018",3.5,My least favourite film of the franchise until i saw the last jedi but i can still enjoy it
"Jun 16, 2018",1,"Bad acting, dialogue, plot choices... and they completely ruined the imagery of the ""clone wars"" in a lot of fans imaginations...  Would've been best left up to the imagination."
"Jun 16, 2018",4,"A couple of awkward lines, but besides that it was pretty good"
"Jun 15, 2018",3.5,"the best on of the prequels.  again so much potential and fell short. anakin acting like a whiny spoil child was hugely annoying.  the clones were cool, lots amazing battles and yoda fighting count dooku was pretty cool."
"Jun 14, 2018",2,"Decent storyline, horrible chemistry and film making. Maybe leave it as a book or something."
"Jun 13, 2018",2,"My least favorite of the Star Wars movies. Nothing really consequential happens until the last 20 minutes, and even the thrilling duels and arena battle aren't enough to over shadow the terrible dialogue (""I hate sand"") and slow moving plot."
"Jun 13, 2018",5,Una basura de pelicula

"Jun 03, 2018",3,"A few more action scenes than the Phantom Menace, but disappoints even worse than where The Phantom Menace did."
"Jun 03, 2018",3.5,This was awful until the final battle wher the film became epic!
"Jun 02, 2018",3.5,The last 45 minutes outweigh the horrid romance scenes.
"May 31, 2018",5,the battle geonosis was shown very well. how the clone wars began.
"May 31, 2018",3,A fun movie that is brought down by some bad dialogue and messy story telling. But there are some nice Star Wars moments within.
"May 30, 2018",0.5,"Say what you will about The Phantom Menace, but Attack of the Clones is more worst than the first (my opinion if you disagree with me). The wooden acting is still their, same thing goes for the bad writing; with some corny romance and all the political talk they throw are not well followed and interesting. "
"May 29, 2018",2,"George Lucas, what was that? I'll tell you what I want to hear from him, a 2 and a half hour rushed CGI seizure with a lot of dull acting with clunky comedy. THE worst in the franchise."
"May 29, 2018",2,"Bad, bad, bad dialogue. But Obi-Wan has a great beard."
"May 28, 2018",2.5,Doesn't make me hate Star Wars looking at you TLJ

"May 27, 2018",0.5,"Oh dear lord. This movie is just really bad. The acting is laughable, the plot is terrible and let's just say 4 words. ""I don't like sand."""
"May 27, 2018",2.5,this film sucks but i enjoy it for its cheesy and cringe moments
"May 27, 2018",1,i hate episode 2 its course and rough and irritating and it getts everywhere
"May 27, 2018",0.5,"Lightsaber fights at the end were only half desent. Rest of the movie was long, boring, and dead."
"May 26, 2018",1,"Attack of the Clones features an awful romance and horrible dialogue, and delivers what is easily one of the worst films in the Star Wars saga."
"May 26, 2018",3,"The worst of all movies. Way too much CGI, Anakin's still a big let down, to much cheesy and poorly written romance story. But McGregor still shines and the battle scenes in the end are good, but no match for todays standarts. 3*"
"May 26, 2018",4,I actually liked this film because it had a fett in it... other than that it sucked.
"May 26, 2018",5,"Star Wars the Clone Wars have happened the Clones are the Soldiers to face the battle droids the Sith are trying to take control of everything it’s up to the Jedi to bring Peace, keep in mind how Anakin acts with his personality, is he becoming bad or good! That’s where you find out Anakin is a Jedi and pretty competitive with fighting along with his master Obie Wan. Both must take the Sith down. "
"May 25, 2018",5,Ah the cloners rock!
"May 25, 2018",2.5,"By skipping over literally every minute of the cringeworthy Anakin/Padme romance subplot, the movie becomes tolerable, and quite enjoyable in some aspects. Particularly the third act."
"May 25, 2018",0.5,anakin is now a whiny bitch.  the jedi are cool with leading a SLAVE army of clones.  morally gross.
"May 25, 2018",2,"For the love of God, please stop ruining Star Wars. "
"May 25, 2018",5,So much better than Disney Star Wars
"May 25, 2018",4.5,"An amazing movie has aged well, gave a great insight into the star wars universe"
"May 23, 2018",4,"A good continuation of the story of Anakin. This movie is rather dialogue heavy at times, so it might not be as suitable to the younger audience. 

Anakin's abilities in the force grow, but his arrogance creates problems for himself and his mentor. Political tensions rise as we see the beginnings of the Empire and Anakin's turn."
"May 21, 2018",4.5,"Attack of the Clones is an exceptional step up from The Phantom Menace that weaves an exciting tale of our now grown characters. Lucas makes the right decision of pushing away Jar Jar Binks to focus on the well developed characters and develop more creative humor rather than the childish gags Binks brought in Phantom Menace. Introduced to bounty hunters, execution arenas and upgraded militant droids - the heroes face off in an excitingly gripping movie; with the inclusion of the slight flawed romantic gestures of Anakin, this movie still encaptures emotion from his journey to find his mother and packs a punch with the new villains Jango Fett and Count Dooku taking the charge."
"May 20, 2018",3,Again looks like a star wars movie feels like a star wars movie! Not the best instalment in the prequels but still good fun to watch with plenty of action and lightsaber duels.
"May 20, 2018",5,"The script for the movie was atrocious.  The characters were good, but there's only so much even a talented actor can do with a bad script.  The action was still good but maybe a little too much CGI.  Not the worst in the franchise...but it's close.  The only Star Wars movie worse than this is ""The Last Jedi"".  This movie at least left me wanting to see more of the Star Wars universe and had me excited for the next movie.  Overall this still felt like a genuine Star Wars movie."
"May 19, 2018",3,Better than Disney's Star Wars
"May 19, 2018",5,Like a Star Wars version of Camelot this film has it all. Groundbreaking CGI and originality which bests anything to come out of Disney era to date.
"May 19, 2018",2,"This movie was poor showing for the Franchise. The special effects and computer graphics make it a great show to watch but the poor script, dialogue and horrible acting from the main characters, hurt the movie. There is no chemistry between Hayden and Natalie, 2 actors which have done great work in other movies. It's still worth watching as long as you don't have high expectations.  Lastly, the battles are well shot and entertaining."
"May 19, 2018",2,"I don't feel this was nearly as bad as the first one, but still pretty bad. if you can fast forward past the whiny anakin/padme bad acting scenes it's not so terrible. Obi Wan and Palpatine are probably the best to see in this movie."
"May 19, 2018",5,Great non Disney film
"May 18, 2018",4,Much better than Menace but not Hayden as good as in part III
"May 17, 2018",3.5,"I didn't hate this movie as much as everyone else. It was bad, but at least it wasn't The Last Jedi."
"May 17, 2018",3,"I don;'t like sand.
This movie is fine but the name of the whole movie almost means nothing until the end of the movie."
"May 17, 2018",5,"My favorite, I love how the story shows actual Escalation and the Plot Grows and the Stakes rise each and every film, as two people from secluded cultures hold onto one another as everything they know and love, crashes down around them..."
"May 17, 2018",5,A real Star Wars film with great action and character development. Thank you George Lucas.
"May 17, 2018",4,As a Star Wars Fan This was my favorite from the prequel era!
"May 17, 2018",4,This is a family favorite that we watch a least once a year along with the rest of the PT and the OT!
"May 17, 2018",1.5,"Attack Of The Clones = Be bored for 2 hours straight.
The Last Jedi = Be bored for 2 hours straight and lose all your brain cells.
Yeah I think I'll take AOTC, thank you very much."
"May 16, 2018",2.5,"Cringeworthy at times,bad too.But amidst all that bad stuff hides a fun action movie."
"May 09, 2018",3,"It was a MEHHH, maybe I will vote high because star wars will always have a special place for me. Love seeing boba."
"May 07, 2018",3,Better than the Last Jedi..... But it's hard to make a movie that bad
"May 06, 2018",4.5,"I have to say that I love  this movie. This is the Jedi at its best, fighting and suffering together, and none of them is thinking about retirement. The visuals are stunning, Obi Wan is just excellent, and Natalie Portman is gorgeous. Even the politics make sense,  the fall of a Republic and the beginning of an Empire. It has the greatest Yoda line, ""the shroud of the dark side has fallen.""  The music is also epic, pure John Willians emotion. I have no problem with the plots, specially the Obi Wan / Anakin relationship, wich I think is great. Attack of the Clones is a great movie."
"May 04, 2018",5,my favorite of all the films. severely under-rated.
"May 03, 2018",3,"""Attack of the Clones"" is a minute improvement over ""The Phantom Menace"". Might want to skip through the cringe worthy romance."
"Apr 29, 2018",4,"You can not please everyone but these movies have to be understood first. You have to see what George was doing when he came up with the prequels. Once you do that, you will see how good these movies are. I did see how and what George was doing in developing the store and how he tied it in with the original trilogy. Give the movie the chance it really deserves."
"Apr 29, 2018",2,The worst of the Prequels.  But a few fun battle scenes.
"Apr 27, 2018",3,"this installment gave me hope of George Lucas redeeming himself after the Phantom Menace tragedy, but when I first saw it, I was even more disappointed. This movie hod nothing, it was empty, filled with horrible acting, and cringe lines. The acting is once again horrible, and there is nothing to like about the movie. The good parts of the movie only lasted for about five minutes, the rest was predictable George Lucas style star wars. At least the Phantom Menace had Darth Maul, and the pod race, this had nothing. Star wars the Attack of the clones is the worst star wars movie by far, a true tragedy"
"Apr 27, 2018",4.5,I liked this film a lot.
"Apr 25, 2018",2,this had a lot of potential and some underrated action scenes but it focused too much on Aniken and Padme's love story.
"Apr 25, 2018",2,Talk about bad acting and no chemistry. It's almost as if Portman and Christiansen were trying to act bad. George we love you but please come up with the ideal and let someone else write and direct please.
"Apr 25, 2018",3,Better than Phantom but storyline still weak...
"Apr 23, 2018",3,"A pretty good film exists within this movie, it just needs 15 minutes cut out of it.  Did a lot of world building."
"Apr 20, 2018",3.5,"Before The Last Jedi came out, this was the worst Star Wars movie of all time. However, that’s not all an insult. Episode 2 is a good movie on its own. However, clunky CGI, as well as poorer dialogue quality than in The Phantom Menace (as well as ROTS too) hinders the movie. Hayden Christensen’s performance is mediocre at best in this film, possibly even shaky. Hayden does however bounce back in Revenge of the Sith, becoming the one and only Anakin. The shining lights that are Jango Fett, Mace Windu, and Count Dooku are clouded by the CGI. The Clone Wars deserve a new movie, as this should’ve been the best and most exciting of the prequels. Rating: 3.5/5... 74% "
"Apr 15, 2018",2.5,Least favorite Star Wars film
"Apr 15, 2018",3.5,"Introduction and first battle of clones was amazing, Jedi vs sith fight scenes were excellent as well. Battle of Genosis was awesome. Other than these few moments, the rest of the movie was kind of boring, reason I took off stars. Regardless, can watch this movie over and over. "
"Apr 07, 2018",1,"Easily the worst of the Prequels. The film has a horribly artificial look to it and it's stale plotting makes this so boring. Worst of all, the constant over use of Shakespearean dialogue over and over makes me never want to see it again."
"Apr 06, 2018",1,bleh this is a trash romcom in space but its not funny or romantic
"Apr 05, 2018",1,"This movie is soooo bad it would be laughable if I wasn't so angry that something so pandering and poorly written was being passed off as Star Wars official canon. The writers (Lucas among them I presume) don't care a thing for any of these characters and the actors, most whom are veterans of the stage and screen, have no idea how to care about the characters they embody. The acting is on par with a soap opera at best. And if someone doesn't kill Jar-Jar soon here I'm going to scream as I rip my ears off and gouge out my eyes. All-in-allanenjoyablefilmIhighlyrecommend"
"Apr 04, 2018",2.5,"Aside from the Jango/Boba Fett backstory and the Arena Scene, I didn't enjoy much in this movie. For me, this is the lowest point in the SW franchise."
"Apr 04, 2018",2,"Pretty much has all the same weak points as The Phantom Menace with not many improvements. For once we actually get to see the Jedi do something, however then there's also the dreadful romance story."
"Apr 03, 2018",1.5,"While improving on its predecessor in some areas, it falls short in some other areas and ends up feeling like a much less genuine product. The shift from film to digital cameras gives this episode a very distinct clean cheap look, and the cgi suffers the most from this too. Performances are bad, the dialogue is laughable at times. The mystery in place is interesting, but the swap between that plot and terrible romance scenes break the pace. The highlight of the film is the action scene near the end in the Petranaki Arena on Geonosis, with a large group of Jedi engaging in battle, but there's very little substance here and ends up feeling quite boring and hollow."

"Mar 26, 2018",2.5,Probably the worst Star Wars film in the saga.
"Mar 25, 2018",3,"Probably the weakest Star Wars movie of the orginal 6, but i still enjoyed it alot. Which is a testament to the greatness of the Star Wars brand, which even at it's lowest, is still pretty good. If only there was more Clone Wars in the Attack of the Clones, and less Twilight..."
"Mar 21, 2018",4.5,"Worst of the Star Wars movies, but it's still Star Wars."
"Mar 20, 2018",2,"not great, the scenery is hard to swallow as everything is overly CGI. the writing and script is clunky "
"Mar 20, 2018",2.5,"The Attack of the Clones has some worthwhile action sequences and gorgeous visuals, but some annoying characters, bad writing  and cheesy, unmemorable plot points makes this movie still  forgettable and bland."

"Mar 19, 2018",2,"Wow, this film was extremely disappointing. The acting is still rubbish, except for Ewan McGregor of course. The story is confusing and unbalanced. The only good thing about this film is the visuals. They are 10x better than the ones in the Phantom Menace. This film is watchable for only hardcore Star Wars fans."
"Mar 18, 2018",3,"The political drama continues, the characters had an old theatre feeling that felt peculiar and interesting, the character of Anakin makes me nervous, the backgrounds are very elaborated and innovated, the romance between Anakin and Padme is very sweet, I don't like too much the acting of boba fett in this one, the character of count dooku play by Christopher lee creates a very strong atmosphere, the fabric sequence seems to be there for filling, the war sequences felt real, Yoda looks very powerful"
"Mar 17, 2018",2.5,"A great story with terrible casting and lame dialogue.  Actually Natalie Portman's Padmé Amidala is decent, but  Hayden Christensen's Anakin is wooden &amp; the chemistry between them is fizzles not sizzles."
"Mar 14, 2018",3,At least it wasn't as bad as the Last Jedi.
"Mar 13, 2018",3,When you don't listen to your elders you lose a hand! Quick to Anger....better cool down there young Skywalker! Yoga has is Force Eyes on you 😑
"Mar 12, 2018",2.5,"Better than phantom menace, with some good ideas. But some of dialog was just plain bad, I don't know if it was the choose of actors or the script. But ther performances should have been better. I feel this and Phantom menace should have been merged into a single film"
"Mar 05, 2018",0.5,Worst of the prequels?? In my book.... Yes 
"Feb 27, 2018",5,i don't like sand it's corse rough and  irritating and it's get everywhere
"Feb 27, 2018",1,Pretty terrible. The worst of any Star Wars movie by a wide margin.
"Feb 26, 2018",3,"Attack of the Clones is probably the 2nd best Star Wars prequels after revenge of the sith, although is it my favorite movie enjoyment wise. It features my favorite character Jango fett, and coincidentally one of the things I don’t like is that jango got killed off so easily. Also the bounty hunter chase in the beginning was kinda grody. But other than the only thing I really didn’t like is that anakin got his hand chopped off by dooku, as I feel this is a rip off of Luke getting his hand chopped off in episode V. "
"Feb 26, 2018",0.5,The Last Jedi is better 
"Feb 24, 2018",2.5,"This movie is only a step above Phantom Menace if anything. It has all of the same problems, but at least there is more combat in this movie."
"Feb 22, 2018",3,"The Last Jedi was so bad that it made this film and The Phantom Menace look like fantastic Star Wars films. In reality, Attack of the Clones was ok, but not great overall. The forced romance between Anakin and Padmé was a bit cheesy, the CGI didn't age that well, and there are a few lines of dialogue that are quite cringe-worthy. The plot is not the strongest in this film, and George Lucas didn't do enough to show Obi-Wan's and Anakin's friendship in this trilogy. Kenobi said in A New Hope, ""He was a good friend,"" but we didn't really get the chance to see it often in the prequels. Additionally, why would the bounty hunter use poisonous bugs to kill Senator Padmé instead of thermal detonators or bombs? I don't believe it was ever explained why the bounty hunters wanted her dead in the film. They get paid to kill and/or capture, but what were the motives? Had they killed Padmé, Anakin might have never turned to the dark side and it would have ruined Palpatine's plan. For the positives, the fight on Kamino between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett was cool, Obi-Wan and Anakin chasing the bounty hunter at the beginning was entertaining, Jango Fett and his Slave I fighter chasing Obi-Wan's fighter in space was good, the arena battle between the Jedi and battle droids was good, the Battle of Geonosis between the clone troopers and battle droids was awesome, and the final fight between Obi-Wan, Anakin, Yoda, and Count Dooku was entertaining."
"Feb 17, 2018",2,"Attack Of The Clones manages to add something new to Star Wars lore, while boring the shit out of you with a horrible love story and cringe worthy acting...It doesn't even have a Pod Race Scene
 I'll give it 
         - 36%"
"Feb 12, 2018",3,"For the longest time, Attack of the Clones was considered my personal low point in the series, but after re-watching it during a palette cleansing session following the latest entry, I found that it held up a lot better than I thought.

The biggest problem with this entry were some of the casting choices, poor acting, and excessive reliance on CGI for the more nonsensical action sequences like the robot foundry. A lot of people complain that there were too many CGI sequences in general, but the fact of the matter is that a lot of the sequences people think are CGI were actually done with real sets and real props. The blending at that point had just gotten to the point that the two were indistinguishable.

Attack of the Clones fixed some of the problems from the previous entry, but added some new ones of its own. Regardless, I appreciate that George Lucas had an overarching story line for the trilogy and stuck to it. The story is consistent, and coherent, and even challenges your understanding of character motivations, such as with Dooku.

The visuals are still on par with what modern audiences expect. Locations are once again fantastic, and we are introduced to more new settings. It progresses the trilogy, but doesn't really blow your mind with any revelations.

Well worth watching, particularly if you have a soft spot for angsty CW quality romance."
"Feb 12, 2018",3.5,"While proving slower than 'The Phantom Menace', this film has one of the greatest stories in the 'Star Wars' saga. Sure, most of the film's dialogue is weak but again, the action and CG make up for it. I'll give it 74%."
"Feb 10, 2018",5,Lots of people don't like this film but I do.
"Feb 09, 2018",5,"After all these years of imagining what it must have been like, it was so great to finally see adventures of a young Obi Wan and Anakin. And, now we finally get what the Clone War was. Sure, there is some stilted dialogue (don't blame Hayden for that!), but the story and action more than makes up for it."
"Feb 07, 2018",2.5,"This film excels in many ways but fails in one, very specific way: The Anakin/Padmé romance. They are forced together due to the necessity of the plot, chemistry be damned. However, mostly everything else about this movie works, setting up The Clone Wars, a conflict rich in material for the franchise. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a very clear standout here, driving most of the film's plot."
"Feb 06, 2018",4,While not the best of the Star Wars films it is still a fun watch. Good action and it progresses the story even if not as deftly as one would like. Obi-Wan really stood out in this movie with his investigating the mysterious Kaminoans and the clones.
"Feb 06, 2018",4,I admit that I actually like the prequels. While not perfect I still find all of them enjoyable. After seeing The Last Jedi I have an even greater appreciation for them. Some of the dialogue in this film is weak and the acting needs work but it shows Anakin being pulled by the dark side losing some of his morality making his transition to Darth Vader in the next film understandable. We see him torn and his mentor failing him with some dramatic moments. The love story is the weakest aspect of this film but it shows some of the character motivations. The action sequences are spectacular with the arena battle and final duel being especially good. i still enjoy this film to this day.
"Feb 06, 2018",2.5,It was a good movie but the worst Star Wars movie it was boring but had some cool things in it
"Feb 06, 2018",3,"If you mute the tv anytime Anakin talks to Padme, the movie becomes much better."

"Feb 04, 2018",3.5,Yet again...not one of the best...however a fun and creative time.
"Feb 03, 2018",4.5,"After seeing the horrible Force Awakens movie as well as the spectacular failure that is The Last Jedi, I went back and started all over again. The Phantom Menace is slow, but has a great story. This movie is packed with so much wonderful world building and has a great arc for Anakin Skywalker. I have to say that as I get older, my appreciation for all of the movies grows. The deepness of George Lucas' writing is under appreciated by some, but there is a reason that he became a legend in the film industry. There is literally nothing else like Star Wars in cinematic history. The scale, the gorgeous visuals, the mythology-inspired story, and the love put into the entire universe makes me wish I could go back to 2012 and slap the pen out of Lucas' hand and talk him out of selling Lucasfilm to Disney or at least not handing it over to the vapid Kathleen Kennedy. Now we have to deal with the atrocious fan-fiction that JJ and Rian have wrought upon the world. I am so happy that the Revenge of the Fans is in full force and that people are expressing their total displeasure with the lack of care that the universe has been given. "
"Feb 01, 2018",4.5,"Sure there are a few cheesy lines, but there is good character development in this film and the story develops. The prequels have been poorly appreciated, but perhaps appreciation is increasing now that things have changed so much with Star Wars. Much more depth here than The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi."
"Feb 01, 2018",5,It's Star Wars So I'm Giving It Five Stars!!
"Feb 01, 2018",1,"Their is one good scene in this movie and that is the scene where Anakin kills the Tusken Raiders, but still that scene doesn't go for long enough just so they can maintain a PG-13 rating. This movie is awful. It has some awful CGI effects, the Jedi continue to just sit on chairs while the main characters do all he hard work and of course the cringe-worthy dialogue, and don't get me started on the sand scene"
"Jan 30, 2018",3.5,"I don't mind the politics but the writing for Anakin and Amidala could have been better. Still, overall a satisfying film."
"Jan 28, 2018",1,"The worst movie star wars, really bad acting, bad dialogue, bad CGI."
"Jan 28, 2018",5,"Underrated movie, it has its moments of suspense, the Jedi do a lot in this film &amp; Anakin's growth is handled really well by Hayden Christensen."
"Jan 27, 2018",5,"Star Wars attack of the clones is much better than the first Star Wars. Now Aniken Skywalker is a Padwan you may see that Skywalker is becoming more mad and not listening to orders, Etc. so he is like starting to turn to the dark side!! This one had more fighting more action so it was just what I expected pick what side you are on Sith or Jedi! "
"Jan 27, 2018",5,In the minority of people who like this movie.  I particularly liked it due to how we get to see how politics played a role in everything.  Christopher Lee was a tremendous actor... played the role of Dooku so well.
"Jan 25, 2018",5,"Star Wars gets better with each film. Episode 2 is better than episode 1. 
But episode 8 is terrible. Attack of the Clones is far better."
"Jan 25, 2018",5,"In retrospect, this film is so SUPERIOR to Last Jedi/Rogue One and all the appalling Disney trash in every way. 
Come back George, all is forgiven!"
"Jan 23, 2018",5,An absolute masterpiece compared to the Last Jedi. Actually has lightsaber battles in which the protagonist actually suffers loss! His mom dies after being tortured and he gets his hand cut off!
"Jan 21, 2018",2.5,"Similar to The Phantom Menace in several ways, this movie has a muddled plot and a poor script. Anakin and Padme's relationship is as robotic and dull as Hayden Christensen's acting and all the overused CGI. Ewan McGregor is the one bright spot in this movie, but that's not enough to save this deformed mess of a prequel-sequel."
"Jan 19, 2018",3.5,"The core of the prequel trilogy that fully establishes the Age of the Republic into the Star Wars galaxy.  It also shows us the peak skills of the Jedi just before their collapse.  The barrage of color, action, and intrigue, along with the aquatic and sanitized Kamino and the emergence of the clone soldiers, provide a crisp saturation.   Assassin worms, bounty hunters, droids, more Dark Lords of the Sith, and the streets of Coruscant.  While the love story raises eyebrows.  Ewan McGregor successfully takes the lead in this one.  In the only emotional part of the love story, the scene with Anakin's ominous golden arm as he takes Padame's hand at their wedding never fails to chill."
"Jan 19, 2018",2.5,"Not the worst of the Star Wars universe.  First third has more to please your 12-year old self than Last Jedi's first third.   

Would you rather pretend to be Anakin and Obiwan in relentless pursuit through a sci-fi Corurscant on the tail of an assassin/bounty hunter?  Or would you rather be Poe pranking Hux and a bomber pilot kicking down her remote control on a kamikaze run or Leia floating back through space?   Certainly more for the kids to enjoy in Clones, so it inches back out of ""worst Star Wars"" movie mostly because it delivers the goods to please the kids watching than the newer installment does.

Most of the criticism is thrown at Hayden's performance, but through the lens of ""this is an awkward teenage boy"".. he's not just any awkward teenage boy, he's THAT BOY who grows into a mass murderer, so you gotta realize that he was tasked to play a socially awkward character, and in that regard he kind of delivers..."
"Jan 18, 2018",4,"This is my 2nd least favorite Star Wars movie. Attack of the Clones may be an improvement of the previous one but its still lacking compared to the original three. The movie improves with better action, better story and the chemistry between Anakin and Padme. The visual effects and animatronics continue to be gorgeous especially R2-D2. Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, and Anthony Daniels continue to give a great performances. Also the voice over performance from Frank Oz was great. I liked the costumes and makeup as well. The musical score was fantastic just like in all of the others."
"Jan 17, 2018",4.5,"Attack of the Clones is a grand, sweeping, large-scale adventure. The story is mostly great, with only a few stretches that drag, and as with all the Star Wars movies (especially the prequels), the special effects and action are top notch. That is, after all, why you watch the Star Wars movies; to visit unknown worlds and have a ton of fun doing so. Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones isn't a world-class lesson in dialogue, but between the visual spectacle, first-rate action, and heavenly John Williams score, it is entertainment of the highest degree."
"Jan 17, 2018",3.5,"Hands down my least favourite Star Wars film, even my 12 year old self didn't enjoy this one.

Overall story: 
Clunky dialogue, not exactly fast paced, good premise, but didn't deliver. 

Edits:
1.less talking and political drama, just give us that in the opening crawl.
2. Get some better dialogue for them love scenes
3. I think Yoda should never have been seen during the prequels, heard, spoken to and about (over comlink or fuzzy hologram) but never seen. gives a way better reveal for episode 5 hearing all these great stories about Yoda only to lead up to a little green puppet. Mace can take his place and come rescue Obi and Anakin from Dooku
6. Dooku not a Sith but a Dark Jedi, a puppet, + Maul still alive
7. Boba Fett, Jangos actual son and not a clone.
8. Full blown attack on Coruscant should get this movie going with the republic struggling to defend itself, and clones introduced earlier, more clone vs droid battles!  

Question:
I know theres a lot of hate for Hayden Christensens manikin performance, but who would you have replaced him with at the time this movie came out??"
"Jan 16, 2018",3.5,"Was my least favourite episode from SW franchise, before TLJ came out. Now I can call this masterpiece, despite having multiple flaws, annoying characters, and bit boring story."
"Jan 15, 2018",0.5,"Attack of the Clones not only is worse than all three of the original trilogy of Star Wars movies, it somehow manages to be worse than it's direct predecessor the Phantom Menace. It fails at weaving the different plotlines together in a meaningful way, it's worldbuilding was so flawed it required an entire TV show to fill in the gaps, and it didn't do enough to push Anakin towards his dark destiny. It also has the worst performances in a Star Wars movie by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman. Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Temura Morrisson all do good jobs though. It also was the worst Visual Effects of any Star Wars film, with clearly visible green screen where it wasn't necessary."
"Jan 15, 2018",3,"It gets better on each additional viewing, but it is still dragged down by unnecessary gaffes and stiff dialogue."
"Jan 15, 2018",5,"Absolutely delightful film. Almost as good as Revenge of the Sith.

Lucas was a genius, and his films were better than the fans deserved. The fans deserve this Disney garbage."
"Jan 14, 2018",2.5,"After seeing the appalling movie, The Last Jedi, I revisited Lucas' prequels, and they are far better than Rian Johnson's disgraceful movie. Let's get the bad out of the way, first; The bad with Attack of the Clones is that some of the dialogue is ridiculously bad. Secondly-both, Hayden C. and Natalie P.'s performances are very wooden-probably not helped by Lucas' direction. The other issue is that there's, like with The Phantom Menace, still too much abuse of CGI, and everything looks ridiculously computer generated. CGI shouldn't have been used as complete substance, and there should have been more traditional techniques to give it that organic Star Wars feel. Aside from the glaring flaws, the general story is still very good, with good story arcs. It's the second prequel where you can sense that Lucas genuinely cares about the Star Wars universe and how the story lead to Ep. IV, A New Hope. If only the prequels looked like The Force Awakens/Rogue One, or even like a LOTRs, where Peter Jackson got the balance between old movie techniques and CGI, spot on."
"Jan 13, 2018",3.5,"The previous installment in the series had a plethora of issues (not enough action, overly complex plot, overall existance of Jar Jar), and for the most part AOTC imrpoves in those areas.  However, this film also created its own problems.  The ""romance"" between Anakin and Padme was absolute dogshit, Hayden Christiensen's acting is seriously lackluster, and the dialogue is arguably at its worst in the prequels.  The CGI, especially CGI characters, continues to be pretty bad. However, the plot is a lot more fast-paced and interesting than the last movie.  Kamino was fantastic: the clone army and Obi-Wan's fight with Jango Fett was the high point of the whole film in my opinion. Geonosis was great too, aside from the hamfisted factory sequence. I absolutely loved the clone army throughout the whole film, especially in the Geonosis arena scene.  Count Dooku is an amazing villain and Christopher Lee's performance as him is outstanding.  Overall I think it is on par with TPM but not for the same reasons.  It's still an enjoyable film once you get over its shortcomings."
"Jan 13, 2018",3.5,"For me, this movie was a step up from ""The Phantom Menace."" It presented a much more interesting and mysterious story, quite possibly one of the most mysterious Star Wars stories yet. I absolutely love everything to do with Obi Wan in this movie. Kamino and Geonosis are absolutely brilliant planets and the mystery deepens throughout both of those locations. Jango Fett is a fun character, and I genuinely like him more than his son. The fight scene between Obi Wan and Jango is extremely entertaining, although rather goofy because Obi Wan keeps getting blown up. The entire Geonosis sequence is a lot of fun and Sir Christopher Lee shines in this movie. However, I've only covered half of the movie. The storyline with Anakin and Padme can at times be absolutely horrendous and overall significantly weakens the film. George Lucas is trying so hard to show the audience that Anakin and Padme are falling in love, yet we are presented with such an unrealistic love story that basically plays out as an awkward Anakin acting very creepy and impulsive with a reluctant and somewhat disgusted Padme finally giving in to his love when they are about to be killed in the Geonosian arena. The dialogue in the romance scenes is absolutely awful and a pain in the ass to watch, and Hayden Christensen's acting is unfortunately very stale. This movie does contain my least favorite lightsaber battle in the entire Star Wars series as well. It is hard to tell what is even going on and it's just not entertaining. Part of it is just close ups on their faces while they are swinging their lightsabers in the air like animals. It's pretty dumb. Overall, I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars because of an extremely entertaining and interesting storyline with Obi Wan, fun action, and, once again, brilliant music from John Williams but a pretty bad storyline with Anakin and Padme that drags the movie down significantly."
"Jan 13, 2018",5,"It was seeing Last Jedi that truly raised this film in my estimation!
Now it seem like a work of sheer genius in comparison!"
"Jan 12, 2018",1.5,This was a horrible movie but still not as bad as Episode 8
"Jan 12, 2018",5,"My Sixth favorite Star Wars movie, good story that remains faithful to spirit of Star Wars, not like the new Disney abominations."
"Jan 12, 2018",5,"The last half of the movie is wicked, Wayy better than that SJW garbage Disney is making."
"Jan 11, 2018",4,Great movie. The love story and Dialogue were awkward and forced but Obi Wan was incredible in this movie and the Gillian Count Dooku was amazing. Only real issue was everything was done on a green screen.
"Jan 11, 2018",5,"This movie has somuch depth! Look at a character Iike Bail Organa who barely has any appearances or lines and yet every time on screen he's able to do so much. Look a at his facial express and mannerisms at the end of the movie with Palpatine looking at what he's created, toward the future will pride, while Bail is extremely upset and concerned. It's moments like this that enhance the original trilogy-knowing that Bail has been a part of this gift all along-his reverence for the Jedi leading his daughter, years later, to seek out Obi Wan for help. And the tragedy of Anakin's downfall whose only crime was loving."
"Jan 11, 2018",5,"Felt like an actual Star wars film, not some neo feminist garbage."
"Jan 10, 2018",1.5,"A couple good ideas, a bunch of really bad ones, and hands-down the single worst romance I've ever seen on film. Avoid it like it's the f*cking plague."
"Jan 10, 2018",5,"For me weakest of the prequels but still a solid Star Wars movie , only one so far of the main movies to feature that many Jedi fighting alongside each other, and set up ep3 really well ."
"Jan 09, 2018",5,"Better than the new Disney crap except Rogue One, that was good."
"Jan 09, 2018",3.5,"Cool movie, many flaws, but a good attempt to do something truly different."
"Jan 08, 2018",5,I love the fact that there are no Mary Sues in this movie. 5/5 stars!
"Jan 08, 2018",5,"The prequels are a terrific return to the Star Wars universe. People do not appreciate the task of creating the entire universe in which the original Star Wars story takes place. In AOTC exploring Coruscant, traveling to the multiple, diverse worlds, seeing the origins of the Death Star and Boba Fett, and the Start of the Clone Wars were a complete treat. Sure, some of the dialogue was challenging, but this is not some haughty weepy drama film, it's Sci-Fi."
"Jan 07, 2018",4,Definatley had that clunky dialogue but was a good Star Wars film.  Waited a long time to see young Anakin Wield his lightsaber.  Would defiantly had like to have seen Anakin played a bit more straight laced here but All in all good film.
"Jan 06, 2018",2.5,Meh. Definitely not the best Star Wars movie but but there were a few good moments in this film. Most of it was pretty boaring and there was some pretty awful dialogue. An average movie at best.
"Jan 05, 2018",5,better than the new disney stuff
"Jan 05, 2018",5,"I was angry about the original trilogy ""special edition"" when the prequel trilogy was released, and I didn't gave these a fair chance at the time. In contrast now to Kennedyfilm's fake sequels, George Lucas's prequels shine. Love Obi-Wan especially in this episode."
"Jan 05, 2018",1.5,Attack of the Clones is two different movies smashed together. The first is a passable space adventure and decent Star Wars movie starring Obi-Wan Kenobi and an investigation into the murder of an alien and a mysterious bounty hunter... the other is a negative star movie starring Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen and their stilted and forced love story with some of the most cringe worthy scenes and dialogue ever produced by Hollywood. Ultimately the latter is so bad it dooms the former and the whole movie to a flop. The overuse of CGI also gets dishonorable mention as it looked forced at the time and has aged very poorly.
"Jan 04, 2018",1.5,most pointless of the prequels story wise you wont miss anything by skipping this. Tone of the film is more serious and action oriented.
"Jan 04, 2018",2.5,"Not the best star wars film, but the last hour was decent"
"Jan 04, 2018",4.5,"Like with Episode 1, when I first watched this movie when it came out, I think a lot of it went over my head, all the politics aspect of it. However, now that I'm older, especially this past year, I've gone and watched all the prequel movies and find them entertaining. I get them now, and they (episode 1-6) all fit into a whole, complete awesome. Looking over the whole span of the 1-6 saga, I look back to this movie and it's beautiful to see Anakin and Padme's romance. He's a hot-head, completely smitten with her, and completely awkward in how to talk to her, but he's young and has hearts in his eyes, lol. The novel portrays Padme more of a willing paramour than the movie does, so in the movie her dialogue makes Anakin seem a lot more ""stalker"" like. But i love their cute puppy love interactions on Naboo. Looking over the whole saga (1-6), I really love this movie."
"Jan 03, 2018",3.5,"Better than Phantom, but the romance scenes are painfully written. And then there's Hayden Christensen. Action and lightsaber battles may still be worth the price of admission."
"Jan 03, 2018",3,"A touch dull, forced scenes and clunky dialogue and some plain old bad acting, make this one more filler than killer."
"Jan 03, 2018",4,"I know it isn't a popular opinion, but I really like this film. It is the intro to the Clone Wars movie &amp; series."
"Jan 03, 2018",4,"While this movie has its fair share of clunky dialogue and acting it is underrated as a Star Wars Movie. Take another look. This had some of the best visuals and most impressive battle scenes ever filming in the Star Wars universe. The design was brilliant and there are some great / classic Star Wars moments - Yoda with a lightsaber, Anakin falling through Coruscant, Jedi / Droid battle, Mace killing Jango, The Acklay and many more."
"Jan 02, 2018",1.5,"I had always thought this was the lowest point of the Star Wars franchise, I was wrong.  I saw The Last Jedi and this movie is a complete GEM compared to that pile of trash."
"Jan 01, 2018",0.5,"Worst Star Wars film by far. Cringe-worthy dialogue, unconvincing performances, and a plot that bores to tears. Nearly unwatchable."
"Dec 31, 2017",5,So much better than the Last Jedi. Seeing the Last Jedi has given me new found appreciation and love for this movie. I hope Rian Johnson rots in hell for what he did to Star Wars.
"Dec 31, 2017",2,"Gets points for being Star Wars but is by far the worst of them. Badly written, poor acting. Have no idea what they were meaning to do with this film. But it can't have been anything good. Keeps me just about interested enough to not fall asleep. But it can't make up for the romance we have all learnt feel nothing for."
"Dec 30, 2017",2.5,"One of the worse Star Wars films due to it's subpar actor and underdeveloped characters, Attack of the Clones' only saving points are it's great action scenes such as the lightsaber fights (personally I like Yoda in a lightsaber duel), the arena on Geonosis, and the badass bounty hunter that is Jango Fett. But otherwise, an addition to the Star Wars saga that will remain ingrained in our minds for all eternity, for better or for worse."
"Dec 30, 2017",0.5,Plan 9 From Outer Space is easier to watch. 
"Dec 29, 2017",3,"Good movie, plot development ties EpI to EpIII well. At least it makes sense for the most part. Great introducing new worlds, technology, and situations. Its sad to watch Anakin go downhill in his emotional and impulsive nature. But it explains how he slides into the dark side. I don't know why Ep2 has a 57% by viewers, but ok. I liked it well enough to give it a passing grade for a Star Wars canon. Dialogue between Padme and Anakin was abit forced and clunky. Padme has got to have a brick off the load for her to fall in love with him, given what all he said to her. But then again, Natalie Portman's characters fall in love with homicidal maniacs in other movies too like Vendetta for example."
"Dec 29, 2017",5,Way better then the last Jedi
"Dec 29, 2017",1.5,Pretty bad but not as bad as phantom menace
"Dec 29, 2017",3.5,"Great cinematography and special effects, of course.

But I wish George Lucas would let someone else direct. Acting is too stilted, especially from Portman and Christensen. Thank goodness for Ewan McGregor.

And someday Star Wars will develop really robust female characters, I'm sure. But not this day."
"Dec 29, 2017",1.5,"Up until the last jedi released this was the worst Star Wars had to offer. Its still terrible in nearly every way. Overused CGI, terrible acting, cringy romance. Why is it better than Ep 8? Because still you came out of the movie wanting to know what will happen next, you still had characters you cared for and you still had the feeling of being in a star wars movie for most of the time. Something that can not be said about the newest installation. Still, if you would take Ep I and II cut most of the cringy stuff out and put it together, salvaging the few good bits, you would get ONE okayish Star Wars movie. 5&gt;4&gt;6&gt;&gt;7&gt;R1&gt;3&gt;1&gt;2&gt;&gt;&gt;8"
"Dec 28, 2017",4,My apologies to George Lucas.  His prequels tower above Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi
"Dec 27, 2017",2,"People say that star Wars is made for children; Children cannot understand or care about the political intrigues/agendas, about the traders embargo etc. etc. 
All in all it is okay but not a wow film."
"Dec 27, 2017",5,"A mi sí me gustó, es una buena pelicula y quienes la critican es por ser fanboys de la trilogia original, la cual no aporta tantop de historia."
"Dec 26, 2017",1,Can't get how this can have a better rating than episode I. This is even worse in my opinion. CGI sucks extremly in this one.
"Dec 26, 2017",5,This film is great and a true original continuation of the Star Wars saga. The CGI is not the best but the actors except for the guy playing Anakin are really god.
"Dec 24, 2017",2,Slightly better than PM but not by much
"Dec 24, 2017",3.5,There are scenes that I don't care for but all in all a good Star Wars movie
"Dec 24, 2017",0.5,"""Wait! This was a star wars movie?""
This was the worst. Not even a good story or characters besides obi wan and yoda and mace and Dooku. Worst star wars."
"Dec 23, 2017",4,"The romance stuff is weird and cringey, though not completely unexpected given Anakin's psychological makeup.  The chase on Coruscant and the detective subplot with Obi-Wan are the movie's highlights in my opinion.  The scenes with Anakin's anger regarding the Tusken Raiders (both the scenes at the camp, and when he rages to Padme) are frightening in how real everything feels.  You get a little glimpse into Anakin's mind, and Hayden Christensen does a phenomenal job there channeling his inner darkness.  Dialogue like ""slaughtered them like animals. I hate them"" is brutal in its viciousness, and very thematically necessary to properly understanding the Anakin character.  The final third act on Geonosis starts out pretty cool, but then it goes a little too far over the top with CGI overkill (though, this IS the Clone Wars...).  The lightsaber combat is underwhelming, with half-baked fights.  It would have been nice to see a longer fight between Obi-Wan and Dooku (specifically, I wanted to see more of how Anakin would fight against the Count), and I honestly would have preferred seeing far more of that fight than the Yoda one (which felt too contrived).  Not as good as The Phantom Menace or Revenge of the Sith (Episode III is my favorite of the prequels, and probably my second favorite Star Wars movie behind The Empire Strikes Back), but still entertaining enough (also, it's a highly original affair, in contrast to the ridiculous sequel trilogy)."
"Dec 23, 2017",5,"Amazing movie, doesn't deserve all the crap"
"Dec 23, 2017",2,"The story isn't bad. I think I like it a little more because it is Star Wars. I don't really like police stories which is really what this is with an awful love story tacked on. George can't write love stories. It's okay, neither can Timothy Zahn. I wish they would get someone who can, to help them out, though!
I really dislike the characterization of Anakin. Growing up a slave I think would have made him far more practical, more likely to rely on himself instead of others, and once he was freed he would have been driven to succeed and prove that he belonged with the Jedi. The whining, spoiled brat that we get instead is a real let down! He's about 23 but acts like a teenager at best. It really seems to me to be one of the first steps in the attempted take down of Vader. GL has made it clear that he never intended for Vader to become as popular as he became and it seem to me that he resents it a little. He's wanted Luke, Obi Wan, Yoda, and the Droids to be the really popular ones; and they are, but Vader is probably the most recognizable of all. He has made comment about how really pitiful Vader because he's really just a sad, damaged cripple on life support. Sorry George, maybe that's want you wrote, but that's not the way it came off. Maybe you should have had the actors voice instead of James Earl Jones awesome voice and then you could have sold pitiful Vader.
My favorite moment is when Anakin goes after his mother and the result.
Jango Fett is okay but really gets no more justice than Boba. 
The clone planet is okay. 
The battle at Geanosis is pretty cool.
Darth Tyranus  is a rather pitiful Lord of the Sith.
Final battle is pretty cool but again this is a take down of Anakin/Vader in favor of Yoda. I love Yoda, but his skill with a lightsaber seems a little over the top.
Bottom line it's cool to see the move towards the Galactic Empire and destruction of the Jedi. Unfortunately the only Jedi destroyed is Anakin. The attempt to diminish Anakin/Vader and the horrible love story really tarnish this story."
"Dec 23, 2017",1.5,"I have found out that this movie is best watched in bath tub. Every time Anakin and Padme are on screen, just put your head under water ""muting"" the manure and rest is quite enjoyable.

I am really sorry Hayden Christensen, but your acting is horrible pile of... (in this)"
"Dec 23, 2017",4.5,"Attack of the Clones, like its predecessor, is yet another highly controversial and underrated installment in the Star Wars saga.

The movie is, for the most part, split between two stories. The first follows Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala which is largely a romance story. The second is a detective-esque story in which Obi-Wan Kenobi discovers two separate armies that are being built to begin the Clone Wars. Ewan McGregor's superb acting definitely makes Obi-Wan's side of the film more entertaining and mysterious, but Anakin and Padmé's story is by no means awful.

I'd be one of the first to say that the Anakin and Padmé love story has some cringe-worthy dialogue but it makes sense within the context of the universe and the characters. Anakin, a Jedi, has been taught to not love anyone and to have no emotional attachments. Obviously, he would be a little awkward when it comes to these things. Their story takes a more interesting turn when Anakin returns to his home planet in search of his mother.

The entire third act of the film is simply phenomenal. A fight with monsters in an arena, followed by the first battle of the Clone Wars, and then a lightsaber battle between Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and Yoda really help elevate the last 45 minutes or so of the movie to among the best in Star Wars history. The first act also had some solid action and intrigue with an assassination plot against Padmé. The second act is definitely the weakest, mainly because it drags on a little.

The discovery and intrigue elements of Attack of the Clones definitely make it a great addition to the Star Wars saga. It's a little too long for my taste but other than that, I have no huge complaints."
"Dec 23, 2017",3,"Another addition to the star wars universe. Some of the characters are lackluster however the action sequences more then make up for it. Plot is still way above par compared to the latest trilogy (Force Awakens, Last Jedi)."
"Dec 23, 2017",1.5,"While far from being a good movie, it's still better than The Last Jedi."
"Dec 23, 2017",5,Great! Please bring George Lucas back ! Disney is destroying the Star Wars legacy!
"Dec 23, 2017",2.5,Some of the worst dialogue in movie history.
"Dec 23, 2017",3.5,"George Lucas creates an epic adventure with great storytelling and incredible action sequences. Although the film suffers from poor acting, the movie is still a fun watch. "
"Dec 22, 2017",5,Prequels are amazing compared to the new star wars films.. we need Lucas to come back.
"Dec 22, 2017",5,Welcome relief from the poisonous PC stench of Disney.
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"Just seen The Last Jedi and Disney's Attempt to Utterly Destroy this Franchise with their Crazy Leftist Political Agenda; I now Love the Prequals, George Lucas we NEED you back!"
"Dec 22, 2017",5,A fantastic noir/romance movie unlike any other in the Star Wars galaxy. Begun the Clone Wars has...
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"To be fair, the prequels (episodes 1-3) weren't so bad when compared with the the sequels (7-9). Of course though, nothing beats the Original Trilogy. (4-6)"
"Dec 22, 2017",4,"This movie seems a lot better now after watching the Last Jedi.  At least it has some awesome lightsaber duels.  Why was there not a single lightsaber duel in the Last Jedi?  Battling the guards was ok, but nothing like an actual lightsaber duel like in almost every other Star Wars movie."
"Dec 22, 2017",5,The perfect Star Wars experience.
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"Remember seeing this at the cinema when it first came out, liked it then as kid and still loved it now."
"Dec 21, 2017",1.5,"the next two films in essence have the same weakness, on the positive side, a great Williams score, again, great characters, vehicles, green screen projections of star wars worlds, thrilling action and on the down side, flat characters,horrible dialogue, little to no romance, silly scenes like Anakin and Padme rolling around in the grass, plots that don' make much sense, (who would send young Anakin to be Padme personal body guard? How stupid are the Jedi, you don't need the force to see that coming!  Too much green screen and flat uninteresting dialogue kills the movie as well as an over complicated plot line that tries to force some of the story line that had been fleshed out in the original saga but falls way way short."
"Dec 21, 2017",2.5,"Plagued with underdeveloped characters and frustrating plot points, this film continues this disappointingly hollow trilogy, despite fun action scenes."
"Dec 21, 2017",3.5,"Hayden Christensen is the weak link in the film. Not a very strong actor. To be fair, some of his dialogue was corny and poorly written. No real chemistry between Padme and Anakin. Lamest love story ever. Anakin is just creepy and Padme seems to feel it too. Fun movie though. Great planets and creatures. Cool fight scene between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett. Big time battle sequence at the end was pretty cool."
"Dec 21, 2017",0.5,"The worse of the prequels. This film is just horrible, the dialogue is verbal diarrhea and the acting is non existent.
I did not think it could get worse and then...the light sabre duel happened...utter drivel."
"Dec 21, 2017",5,This episode was amazing and gave us what people have been waiting for since Return of the Jedi the clone wars
"Dec 20, 2017",3.5,everything was great except the writing during the love scenes 
"Dec 20, 2017",5,brilliant visuals and a stunning battle in the third act! George Lucas made a much better movie than Disney could ever make!
"Dec 20, 2017",5,George Lucas's best star wars movie since empire strikes back! Loved this film as a kid and still holds up in many ways.
"Dec 20, 2017",2,"Boring, cheesy, and CGI'd to the point of insanity. The mildly entertaining 3rd act doesn't save this mess of a film."
"Dec 20, 2017",3.5,"Okay... real talk time. This move is around 50% terrible. the other 50% should have been made into 100%. The Anakin/Padme plot is very weak and the two of them have zero chemistry on screen.

However! The Detective Obi-Wan plot was awesome, it was a great look into what Jedi did as guardians of the Republic. If they had focused more on that, or changed the plot around to fit more along those lines leading up to the Arena fight, it probably would have been a better movie.

I'm giving 3.5 stars become for all of its fault the movie did show us lots about the universe. We learned more about the Jedi, new worlds, new industries and most importantly we got to see the start of the Clone Wars, something that we've been wondering about since A New Hope. 

Its not a perfect movie, but it can be enjoyable if you skip some scenes."
"Dec 20, 2017",5,My 2nd fav Star Wars movie!
"Dec 20, 2017",1.5,"The worse Star wars film ever made. The unbearable love story between Anakin and Padme that leaves you feeling sick to your stomach, a villain that doesn't seem threatening at all and the incredibly cringe worthy dialogue. This film could of potentially have killed the great legacy of Star Wars on its own.    

Final Score 3/10"
"Dec 20, 2017",5,After watching The Last Jedi I really miss George Lucas. I've changed my mind about the prequel movies.
"Dec 20, 2017",3,They're are things about this movie I cannot stand yet some I really enjoy.
"Dec 20, 2017",5,love the action. fun story too 
"Dec 20, 2017",5,its a pretty great movie. love the final battle
"Dec 20, 2017",2,Bad movie but better than TLJ. Could have made the fight between the jedi's longer at the end.
"Dec 20, 2017",4,After watching the last jedi I respect this a lot more
"Dec 19, 2017",3,A solid effort from Lucas and his team. Cast works well with what they're given and the story is surprisingly well paced and consistent in tone for all it packs in
"Dec 19, 2017",2,"Bad script, poor acting and love scenes, borderline criminal underuse of badass Sir Christopher Lee, nice platform for the third movie to start from i guess? , poorly done investigative drama, definitely the worst of the prequel trilogy"
"Dec 19, 2017",3.5,Not as bad as people think.
"Dec 19, 2017",0.5,If it were possible I would have given it 0 Stars. It's even worse than TPM.
"Dec 19, 2017",3,"Anakin is left behind, being a creep and giving off a rapey vibe, but Obi-Wan is off doing cool things which is very enjoyable to watch. The Jedi Council stuff is great, the senate politics is complex and interesting. Look its not amazing, but it's cannon and better than Phantom.... Sand."
"Dec 19, 2017",3,Pretty sure Tommy Wiseau wrote the dialogue.
"Dec 19, 2017",4.5,"I love the story but the visuals were a problem for me. Most of it looked like a video game. Just wish it looked more real. I actually loved Padmé and Anakin relationship, it was cute although dialogue was cringe at times lol. I loved seeing a glimpse of bad Anakin. Loved seeing the Jedi fighting, great action too!"
"Dec 19, 2017",1.5,Wooden acting? Check. Overuse of CGI? Check. The least-believable romance in film? Check.
"Dec 19, 2017",3,"Its seem better than the previous one but storyline not as good as ""a new hope"""
"Dec 19, 2017",2.5,"A mixed bag this movies biggest problem is the corny love story, and a few minor plot holes.  These Issues did not ruin the experience for me but are still note worthy enough that they bring the quality down.  The movie has some interesting subplots and characters, and some visually interesting scenes as any star wars movie does.  Probably the weakesy of the trilogy, If i was to give this a percent rating it would probably be around 67-72%.  I would like to give it extra because its star wars but that seems silly"
"Dec 19, 2017",5,A real treat. Not sure where the bad ratings come from 
"Dec 18, 2017",0.5,Run away from some of the worst acting and storyline. It would be better if Disney disavowed episode 1-3.
"Dec 18, 2017",2,"The actors in Episode II seem to be trying desperately to create a compelling story here, but the action and romance fall apart at every turn, feeling artificial and ham-fisted while one watches. I feel compelled to defend the actors though, as I imagine working with nothing but green screens and fixed tape to act as cues would make even the best of actors fail to feel invested in their scenes. The promise of sweeping battle scenes and the sagacious Yoda taking to the field of battle come crashing down when it is all reduced to so much computer-generated chicanery that doesn't hold up a year later, much less so a decade on rewatching."
"Dec 18, 2017",0.5,Even worse than the other one. A cluster-f!?* Of CGI and some of the worse dialogue in an English language film! Utter pants!
"Dec 18, 2017",4,"Gorgeous visuals, action packed, less Jar Jar. Some of the romantic scenes are awkward due to clunky dialogue and the film can be slow at times in the middle. The last half hour definitely makes up for the slower second act. Overall it's an improvement on its predecessor, but has some very awkward dialogue. And we finally get to see Yoda fight!"
"Dec 18, 2017",0.5,"Horrible lines, CGI, and acting. One of the worst movies ever made."
"Dec 18, 2017",3,"Puntaje Original: 6.0

Otra película solo de relleno, en realidad no se nota un gran esfuerzo de parte de parte de George Lucas al ponerse a grabar esta película."
"Dec 18, 2017",4,"Awkward dialogue aside this movie has some amazing action, less Jar Jar, and has Yoda using a light saber finally. This movie can be a little slow in the second act but the third act makes up for it!"

"Dec 18, 2017",4.5,"Amazing. Some cringy moments, but all in all, better than the Disney SJW movies."
"Dec 18, 2017",3,not a good installment. the love story was very underwhelming
"Dec 18, 2017",0.5,"AOTC was a mess. It's really a joke, but not remotely funny. Scenes dragged, the script is appalling and the performances awkward. Most the movie is polluted with dated CGI and meaningless dialogue. Almost every scene was irritating to watch. The most glaring problem was none of these actors have any chemistry with each other whatsoever. That is, when there aren't scenes plagued with another slew of CGI characters. The bounty hunter was the only action before that awful ending. And it was just a fan-boy addition. It was a gimmick.

The plot was a disaster. Some ideas were good, but the execution was so atrocious, I wouldn't concede that. If this was a story about Anakin, than why not focus on his desire to free slaves, not some bizarre thereafter unspoken animosity to Tusken Raiders that goes nowhere ? If Anakin was Padme's personal bodyguard, why does he never actually serve that role ? If this was a story about the clones, why have just a few brief scenes where they actually do anything. It's more about the vehicles. And if it's about the vehicles, why not do an actual good introduction to early Imperial cruisers ? Instead we're treated to Yoda who jumps around a lot, like he's Kermit the frog on a caffeine high. Dumb gimmicks intended to hide what an awful movie they produced.

And the ending, it sucked. Aside from wallpaper cast, there's a hideous arena scene where Jedi look like cheap extras. They ride around like idiots, while 3PO plays the role of Jar Jar Binks. CGI battle scenes were just as bad as the gungan battle in TPM. Meaning it didn't look a thing like SW. Lightsaber fights looked tacked on and needless, not to mention badly choreographed. The cheesy dialogue and poor performances were just embarrassing to watch. Took friend and family to see it, and caught them dozing off more than once. This one's a stinker, and it was evident from the first viewing."
"Dec 17, 2017",1.5,"Not quite as bad as Episode 1, but that's damning with very faint praise. Has not aged well, will only continue to deteriorate with time."
"Dec 17, 2017",5,"Ok yeah, minus some lines by Anakin, this movie was amazing. People actually forget that the “I hate sand line” was completely necessary to the canon of Star Wars. The reason Darth Vader does not go looking for the droids on Tatooine in a New Hope is because he hates sand. He hates the thought and feel of it due to the memories it brings with it, (enslavement, dying mother, etc). Constant action and great character development throughout. Might be the most important movie in the saga because of how it sets everything up in the story line. The hate this movie gets is COMPLETELY unjustified."
"Dec 17, 2017",2.5,"The storyline was just average, but the acting was atrocious. Especially from Hayden Christianson. There's no doubt why his career has failed over the last 15 years. Hopefully, Episode III will provide more intrigue."
"Dec 17, 2017",2,Subpar for a Star Wars film. This is the only Star Wars movie I legitimately don't like.
"Dec 17, 2017",5,My favourite from the prequels!
"Dec 17, 2017",2.5,This was the worst Star Wars until TLJ. It’s still a bad movie but I think I’d rather watch this over TLJ sadly enough.
"Dec 17, 2017",2,"The worst of the series, Star Wars Attack of the Clones only has a few memorable scenes (the last 30 minutes being the most notable) but overall fails from terrible performances (especially Hayden Christensen) and a horrible script that tries to act as a romance rather than a drama. Very little to redeem from this film, however it is still watchable. "
"Dec 17, 2017",5,Better than it’s given credit for
"Dec 17, 2017",3,"Obi-Wan becoming the master is a great part of this, and continues the story well from episode 1. I don't dislike Hayden like many, but I also don't like him in this role either. He's ok at best. I think we all wanted that role to feel right, and it didn't."
"Dec 17, 2017",1,"To be honest, I wanted this movie to be good, but it wasn't. I think that is is worse than the Phantom Menace, due to the worst dialogue in any movie ever, maybe a little better than The Room. The CG clone troopers look like they were taken out of the clone wars animated series and slapped onto the screen in this movie. In my opinion this is the worst movie out of all the prequels and the worst Star Wars movie in general. Honestly you could skip this movie and still know what is going on, even when I was like 6 years old, I did not like this movie. One star is a very generous review."
"Dec 17, 2017",3,"Quizás sea la película que menos me gusta de la saga que hicieron en los años 2000, me parece muy aburrido todo el tema del romance entre Padmé y Anakin (aparte de lo mal que actúa el actor que hace de Anakin, en ningún momento se ve feeling ni química entre ambos personajes para creerte su amor).

Lo único decente de la película es Obi Wan Kenobi, que es gracias a él que esta película se salva, y todo el tema de los clones y la batalla final."
"Dec 17, 2017",2,"Meh. It's Star Wars, but clearly lacking the thought-out dialogue that made A New Hope and Empire so gripping. I couldn't care less about the characters and the stakes aren't that high, given we know what's going to happen. 

Maybe a new script and the use of some live set pieces could've made this film good. Instead, we're left with a jumbled mess where the dialogue is worse than the over reliance on CGI."
"Dec 17, 2017",3,"Odd romance juxtaposed with Obi Wan playing detective make an odd pair. Jango Fett, Count Dooku, and Obi Wan save the film."
"Dec 17, 2017",3.5,"This film would not be so bad if Hayden Christiansen wasn't forced to do romance and drama scenes. He just doesn't work. He seems to do fine in the Darth Vader scenes of The Revenge of the Sith, but his performance really is the worst part of this film. Without those scenes the film would have been far more tolerable."
"Dec 17, 2017",4,For all it’s flaws I still really enjoy this film don’t get me wrong it’s not up there with the original trilogy or with revenge of the sith but it’s still a better watch than the force awakens 
"Dec 17, 2017",4.5,At the end of the day the clone wars offers the biggest battle in the history of star wars and we get our first chance to see Yoda wield a light saber.  Obviously too much CGI but that was the theme of movies during that decade.  Look past that and you can see how this truly connects the dots and holds true to the Star Wars Universe.
"Dec 17, 2017",3,"A decent film, certainly not great however. Anakin’s character gets in the way at times because the constant whining can be too much. A few plot holes and cringeworthy dialogue and humor detract as well. That said it successfully sets itself up for the Clone Wars series and also ties together nicely with Episode 3. "
"Dec 17, 2017",3,Better than Phantom Menace. Character development went a long way in Episode 2. Continues the high of good action scenes and the story is progressing nicely. The acting is a bit choppy at times though. 
"Dec 16, 2017",5,"Better than The Last Jedi, rather watch Anakin talk about his hatred of sand for 2 and a half hours than watch that movie for as long."
"Dec 16, 2017",3.5,the main battle seemed rushed but end fight i loved
"Dec 16, 2017",2.5,Better than Phantom Menace.
"Dec 16, 2017",2,Improvement is the big word with Episode 2. The movie still isn`t the Star Wars magic in the original trilogy but it is much better then episode 1. The acting still suffers but the action can almost make up for it. Episode 2 is an improvement but it still isn`t a good movie.
"Dec 16, 2017",1,"Had to rate this just to restore the order in the Star Wars saga. No matter how bad the The Last jedi was, this is still the worst of all the Star Wars films."
"Dec 16, 2017",2,"Easily the worst Star Wars movie made, but not without its moments such as the battle of genosis or obi-wans and jango fetts battle. Also Ewan McGregor amazing portrayal of Obi-Wan makes this movie watchable."
"Dec 16, 2017",0.5,The Worst Star Wars movie ever period
"Dec 16, 2017",5,Miles better than The Last Jedi! After seeing that movie I realized how good the prequels really are. Get rid of Rian Johnson and get my boy George Lucas back or even J.J Abrams just get rid of Johnson 
"Dec 16, 2017",5,"Sixth best movie of all time. Say what you want about acting or dialog in it, it's a great mid point in a 3 movie plot arc and introduces us to new and exciting parts of an amazing story universe. The fight between a Jedi and a bounty hunter was alone worth the price of admission."
"Dec 16, 2017",4,better than The Last Jedi
"Dec 16, 2017",4,Not as bad as people think.
"Dec 16, 2017",0.5,"Disney purposely tried to make everything George Lucas created have no meaning. 

Luke died alone 
Leia was a bad mother who spawned a evil unredeemable child.
Han died alone
The Jedi were wrong and false beliefs
The empire had redeeming qualities. 

It reeks of a corporation creating media to control or minds and beliefs while giving the cheapest of fan service."
"Dec 16, 2017",1,"Better than Episode I, but that does't say much. The action is good, and I like the politics (same for Ep 1) but wow, Lucas should have hired someone to fix his dialogue and to direct this for him. Also, the over-reliance on CGI just kills me."
"Dec 16, 2017",0.5,THIS IS THE WORST STAR WARS MOVIE AND WE CANT LET IT HAVE A HIGHER AUDIENCE SCORE THAN THE LAST JEDI.
"Dec 16, 2017",3.5,Basically everything is great except for Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman. 
"Dec 15, 2017",2,"Boring, slow and mostly a waste of time. The last half hour and end battle scenes are memorable. Otherwise filled with cheesy lines , bad acting and no chemistry between characters."
"Dec 15, 2017",3,"Visualization/Effects (Practical/Special) - 9/10
Acting - 6/10

Film Storyline - 3/10

Although it answered many questions, it felt very crammed and the love story between Anakin and Padme' left me puzzled as it could've been executed better."
"Dec 15, 2017",0.5,So long so boring... good watch if you need to take a nap.
"Dec 15, 2017",4,Everything is great except acting.
"Dec 15, 2017",5,"I MISS YOU GEORGE, I LOVED SO MUCH OF THIS FILM"
"Dec 15, 2017",3.5,"Probably the weakest of the prequels, this film nevertheless has improved as time has gone on in my mind. There are plenty to dislike about it: horrible lines and love scenes between Padme and Anakin, a whiny cry baby Anakin, and a dull first half. However there is a dramatic improvement in the second half. The Battle of Geonosis is epic and as good as anything in Star Wars. The masterminding of the war by Sidious is fun to follow and the film is a good layover to Sith. Once again, although not nearly as strong as the other movies (although VASTLY better than episode VIII) it is still entertaining and does not deserve some of the harsh reviews it has received over the years."
"Dec 15, 2017",4,No longer the worst episode in the saga
"Dec 13, 2017",0.5,it's definitely the worst Star Wars movie ever made
"Dec 13, 2017",2,"Attack of the Clones is perhaps not a step in the right direction for the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. The drama and the emotions are more awkward and unsettling than the previous chapter and even the vast imagination of George Lucas is broken apart by this completely artificial film. 

The story. The characters. The drama. The locations. 
They're more lifeless and artificial than ever before. It's almost incredible just how different Episode II is next to literally any other film. No film has such a unique shittiness to them.  This is what an uncomfortably ""personal"" film looks like by someone who doesn't understand people, emotions or basic storytelling technique. 

I'm a Star Wars fan... but ouch..."
"Dec 12, 2017",2,No improvement on the boring affair that was The Phantom Menace. It was no prequel redemption unfortunately as the plot was boring and hard to watch. Action scenes involving Christopher Lee as Darth Tyranus were the ultimate highlights.
"Dec 11, 2017",2,Completely boring until the end.
"Dec 11, 2017",1.5,"Easily the worst installment of the Star Wars saga, even worse than The Phantom Menace. Anakin is now a whiny brat that blames all his problems on Obi-Wan, even his mother's death. He is also a creep around Padme and love for one another is utterly forced. This is who will eventually become Darth Vader? Plus, the Jedi Council was left unaware that a clone army was created in secret by a former Jedi Master. The CGI is overused and is sorely dated. Boba Fett is revealed to be a younger clone of Jango Fett. The final battle is visually stunning, but is only included for the sake of Lucas showing off the visual style. The final 15 minutes of the film is the only satisfying moment of the entire film."
"Dec 09, 2017",3.5,"The second installment of this trilogy still never soars as high as any of the original films, but remains fitfully entertaining. Lucas' flaws from 'The Phantom Menace' still remain, such as an undercooked screenplay and an overabundance of busy CGI backgrounds, and Hayden Christensen was clearly not the right choice for a character who is meant to display such internal conflict. This also makes his romance with Portman fall flat, especially since their dialogue is rather shallow. On the other hand, the film has a climax that delivers to the fullest (seeing Yoda in full action for the first time is undoubtedly the biggest fanboy moment). Christopher Lee's presence is also a great contribution, even if his character has almost as little development as the previous film's main antagonist. All in all, the film is a fun blockbuster that makes an entertaining watch, despite its narrative shortcomings. "
"Dec 08, 2017",3,"Allowing for some dull moments, this movie has considerable visual style"
"Dec 07, 2017",3.5,Good middle story. Not much for a stand alone. 
"Dec 03, 2017",4,"Actually, I thought this was the best of the first three episodes."
"Nov 28, 2017",4,"If it wasn’t for Yoda, the Starwars universe would have fallen."
"Nov 26, 2017",2,"As is the case with this movie's predecessor ""The Phantom Menace"", ""Attack of the Clones"" does have it's high points.  One such high point is the well produced action sequences.  They certainly help add to the entertainment value of this movie.  Also the scenes on Planet Kamino which is the location of the production and training facilities for the clone army are also well done.  However the movie is hurt by a number of flaws.  The biggest is Hayden Christensen's abysmal performance as Anakin Skywalker.  He is the central character to this movie and he fails on just about every level.  Scenes that are supposed to be emotional and dramatic come across as just plain stupid due to Christensen's poor acting ability and absolutely cornball dialogue.  Also he has no chemistry at all with Padme Amidala played by future Academy Award winner Natalie Portman.  You know there is a major problem with your movie when the best character in it isn't even a human being.  It's instead a computer generated image.  Specifically Yoda.  Still there is enough to like about this movie to recommend it.  However once you have finished watching it you will remember how good the original trilogy is."
"Nov 26, 2017",3,"Corny, cheesy, could have been better.  All-in-all, unfortunately, still better than The Force Awakens."
"Nov 24, 2017",3.5,Good movie with good fights
"Nov 23, 2017",3,"Attack of the Clones is an even harder movie for me to review than The Phantom Menace. Though many see Episode II as a step up from I, I'm not quite sure. Though I've given both films 3/5 stars, I honestly have to give a slight edge to The Phantom Menace. Much of the movie feels as if George Lucas took the criticisms of ""too much talking"" in the previous installment and just amped up the action as a result. In doing so, a lot of the action feels hollow, as there isn't the greatest character development. Additionally, as many have pointed out, the acting here isn't exactly the greatest, which is a shame considering the talent on board. This isn't the fault of the cast, as they were not given much direction to work with. Despite these pretty decent-sized flaws, there's still enjoyment to be had here. Though the action is hollow, it still is well-executed and much fun to watch. The general story is also pretty interesting and fits in well with the rest of the Star Wars saga. I know plenty of people dislike how the origin of the Clone Wars was set up, but I don't mind it. I only wish we had gotten to see more of the conflict on film (rather than just the beginning here and the end in Revenge of the Sith), but The Clone Wars TV series would have to suffice that desire later. All-in-all, despite its numerous flaws, I think there is still entertainment to be had with Attack of the Clones, even though I think it's the weakest of the live-action Star Wars films."
"Nov 23, 2017",4,"My least favorite of the Star Wars films but oh my god there's still so much great shit packed into this one movie!! I mean Jango Fett is one really cool dude, amiright?"
"Nov 21, 2017",0.5,"While I did not like ""The Phantom Menace"" this film was worst. George, you got face the fact that you did way way way way too good on the originals and they can't be beat."
"Nov 18, 2017",2,"The love story between Anakin and Padme doesn't feel right. Plus, the time gap between The Phantom Menace and this movie, doesn't suit the film, as too much has happened between them. Once again, this film feels way too modern and advanced compared to the other Star Wars film. It makes you question ""Why didn't they use that in the original trilogy? It seems to be very useful."" The dialogue is unnatural, and the love story is cliche. Attack of the Clones doesn't live up to what a Star Wars movie should be."
"Nov 13, 2017",3,"While Attack of the Clones suffers many problems from its predecessor, it manages to fix many of them. At times, the plot still feels out of place and lost. But nevertheless, we feel like there is an objective or a finish point that the movie seeks. The action sequences are improved, but still barely above average, except the final battle. The final battle is well filmed and visualized, and best of all feels necessary and not forced. The weakness in this movie, ironically is the main character; Anakin Skywalker. At times, you would find yourself rooting against him, which is a big flaw in any movie. Anakin's dialogue and Hayden's acting abilities make it seem like a fan movie could achieve better. The whole Naboo sequence is out of place, and the love story felt really forced and unnatural at all. There are sequences such as the attack on the sandpeople, which should've lasted longer, and it could've offered plenty more development to a much criticized protagonist."
"Nov 12, 2017",2,Very boring and too long.
"Nov 07, 2017",1,I don't like Attack of the Clones. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.

"Oct 11, 2017",5,not better than the phantom menace but really good action sequences
"Oct 11, 2017",2,This wasn't a good film. Hate the acting between the two lovers and didn't like it. The plot? was dull along with the pace of the film was incredibly slow Ewan McGregor was the only character I liked in that whole film.
"Oct 09, 2017",1.5,I watched this mere days ago and all I can remember is thinking what awful casting choices were made. Some good visuals in the battle scenes. Thats about as generous as Im gonna be
"Oct 09, 2017",2,"With this being the second story in the prequel for Star Wars, you'd think it'd be good right? Wrong! This episode continues episode 1's decent plot and replaces it with a story that feels like an eternity to watch and typically leaves me almost falling asleep with the excessive character building of Anakin and Padme and lack of action scenes, despite the very beginning being one. Overall, I wish that I could forget this episode's existence and move on with more interesting things instead. Definitely something you mustn't watch."
"Oct 08, 2017",4.5,some weird dialogue but not enough to ruin the movie. lots of great action and good set up for ROTS. 
"Oct 08, 2017",2,Remove one character and the score would improve greatly.
"Oct 07, 2017",2,"If Lucas could actually make a romance that isn't creepy and weird, this would have been a lot better."
"Oct 07, 2017",2.5,"I saw this when it was first released and must have gotten caught up in the hype, because upon rewatching, I thought it was quite bad. I'm more entertained by ""Star Wars Rebels"" on Disney XD."
"Oct 04, 2017",1,I think it is the worst prequel.
"Sep 21, 2017",4,"Attack of the Clones does better than is predecessor The Phantom Menace but still doesn't match the original trilogy. With good performances as usual, the movie is an enjoyable Star Wars prequel!"
"Sep 05, 2017",3,"This movie, I admit, has a great action apart from this is the same as The Phantom Menace. A two parallel story which is explained by both individuals about Obi-Wan and the relationship between Anakin and Padmé who will became into one whole story. But, this series is more like to focus on the romance rather than the original Star Wars as shown beyond. It's awkward and wasting too many times, although this is an important point in explaining Anakin's character who fells little by little into the dark side. Obi-Wan has a less part than Anakin although some of the scenes feel like tedious, monotonous, and awkward as well. By the way, I don't see any ""Attack of the Clones"" other than the climax. This is ""The Beginning of Dark Anakin"" which is nearly the whole story that focuses on it."
"Sep 05, 2017",5,Lol a bunch of old people hate the prequels and it's ridiculous. Great movie
"Sep 03, 2017",0.5,I hate the prequels. This is a very bad film. The prequels do prove one thing. You can have an almost unlimited budget for special effects but if the story is bad and the dialogue is bad then you are making a really bad film.
"Sep 02, 2017",4,So I see some people are not for this movie I don't see why I thought it was a good movie! I noticed it got right down the action and fighting so it starts to get better as the series continues
"Sep 01, 2017",5,"A very good film. Yes, the cgi was too much but fortunately we saw less Jar Jar Binks, more great action scenes, and overall a better quality film than The Phantom Menace and certainly a million times better than the Disney trash like The Force Awakens and Rogue One."
"Aug 23, 2017",2,A Muddled mess. Weaker story even than TPM
"Aug 19, 2017",1.5,I.HATE.HAYDEN he's such a bad actor
"Aug 19, 2017",1,Lifeless and boring!
"Aug 15, 2017",0.5,"Overall, I hate this movie. ""Attack of the Clones"" is a faster film than its predecessor and has some intriguing moments, but sadly it is boggled down by horrible dialogue and a horrible love story that makes this film my least favorite out of all of them. At least Ewan McGregor gives a good performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi...

"Aug 14, 2017",2.5,"Though it is an improvement over ""A Phantom Menace"", with better action, the movie still falls flat through bad dialogue and a dumb plot."
"Aug 11, 2017",1,"Alright, ""The Phantom Menace"" wasn't that awful ... but ""Attack of the Clones"" was. Holy Shit! What a bad movie. Starting with the romance, I mean, Hayden Christensen is one of the worst actors out there, I mean ever. Neither his chemistry with Natalie Portman nor the romance itself works. The CGI, the wire work and the green/blue screen are all awful, this movie contains of the worse visual effects works ever made in cinema. As well as some other decisions and casting choices made this movie the worst of the entire franchise."
"Aug 10, 2017",1.5,"Jesus this is terrible... 

I still want to say Hayden had something like a rookie QB with a shitty Offensive Coordinator (George Lucas,) but this is close to unwatchable if you are a true Star Wars fan. Wtf is the dialogue about sand and the cardboard characters all of the sudden? 

To listen to us bitch because sand is so coarse and rough head on over to broforcesquad.com"
"Aug 10, 2017",1.5,This was one of the worst films I've ever seen and THE worst Star Wars film I've ever watched
"Aug 03, 2017",1,"Oh God, Lucas!? What have you done to this movie!? 2002 was a really dark time for Star Wars. This is really what is supposed to the WORST Star Wars prequel and the WORST Star Wars movie IN GENERAL!!! Even though I liked the battle of Geonosis, even though I thought Count Dooku and Jango Fett were pretty good characters, even though I liked the first battle between Obi-Wan and Jango, what really bothered me the most is HOW MUCH ROMANCE IS USED!!! Anakin and Padme are a good Star Wars couple, but really their introduction as a couple is just FILLER!!! Zam Wessel was a pretty decent character in this film, but really she had so much little screentime like Venom in Spiderman 3 and evil Optimus in Transformers 5 years later. And I'll be honest, young Boba was a mediocre character. THAT'S ALL WHAT I HAVE TO SAY."
"Aug 02, 2017",1.5,"After Episode I, George Lucas strikes back with one more steaming pile of shit. Awful CGI, empty characters, wooden acting (with the exception of Sir Christopher Lee and Samuel L. Jackson - and McGregor too sometimes), one of the most cringe-worthy love stories ever, dozens of useless scenes, shameless exposition... Apart from a handful of sequences that could and should have been better but at least managed to be mildly interesting, anything else herein - even the action - is just plain boring."
"Jul 30, 2017",2,"In my opinion, this movie was worse than The Phantom Menace. About 65% of this movie is a love story between the now kinda grown up but still whiny Anakin Skywalker. He was actually really annoying in this movie. There was more complaining from him than there was action in the whole movie! And the romance that Lucas tried to bring about on the audience was just cringy to watch. But, now on to some positives, I just needed to get those rants out of my system. The action definitely was more exciting in this movie. The Sith Lord continues to try and bring about the Dark Side of the force with an introduction of Count Dooku (the new villain for this movie.) The final battle between Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Count Dooku is exciting to watch and we even get to see Yoda fight for the first time in this series. Overall, Attack of the Clones fails to bring about the feels of a true Star Wars movie as too much attention was focused on bringing about the cringiest love story in Star Wars history."
"Jul 20, 2017",2.5,This is not good I don't enjoy it but I like the Jedi fight scene at the end and the concept of clones
"Jul 05, 2017",3,"This is looked upon by a large crowd of Star Wars fan as the worst movie in the franchise, and while I can understand why, I respectfully disagree. Far from one of the best Star Wars movies, I will admit that, but it was alright. I don't like the romance between Anakin and Padme since it feels cheesy, awkward, and I never felt like there was a spark in their chemistry, but the environments of this film look great, and the light saber fights are the greatest part of the movie. I especially love the duel between Yoda and Count Dooku. I know some people don't like seeing Yoda fighting with a light saber, but I thought it was cool that he did that. But again, the major downside for me is Anakin and Padme's relationship since it really does bring the movie down from being good."
"Jul 05, 2017",3.5,"Way better than Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones still has some flaws but the CGI looks better."
"Jul 04, 2017",5,Good film not better than the first
"Jun 26, 2017",2.5,"Light saber battles and action sequences are filmed really well, but writing is still awful."
"Jun 25, 2017",0.5,You know what's worse than sand?
"Jun 25, 2017",3.5,"Attack of the Clones has a lot of clichés, it really exagerates...ejem ejem.. Shmi Skywalker... the strange development of the love story. 
But the climax of the battle was outstanding and perfect. I really liked that battle with John Williams' music."
"Jun 20, 2017",1.5,"Credit must be given to Attack of the Clones for committing to more action-packed elements and world-building. Unfortunately, the wooden acting and often times static plot overshadow most of the good intentions, amounting to a Star Wars chapter that once again favours spectacle over substance."
"Jun 18, 2017",3.5,"To call Attack of the Clones an improvement over The Phantom Menace would be true but it's also not saying much. There's still a half-assed love story between Natalie Portman and whiny man-child Hayden Christensen, some of the performances from anyone who isn't an already established character played by the same actor from the original trilogy or Ewan McGregor feel phoned in and some of the CGI can get distracting. I know 3.5/5 stars isn't bad but it shows that the film has enough flaws to NOT get 4 stars. There's still a 3 in it after all indicating mixed opinions. At least I'm contributing to the audience score. Anyway, on to the positive things: The visuals can be a treat when they want to, even with all the distracting CGI in the way, the action sequences are pretty fun which include sci-fi takes on car chases and gladiator matches plus an epic final battle and, as I previously pointed out, Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan is great. He's one of the few actors who appear to be committed to what they're doing and not just thinking to himself ""Money!"". True, George Lucas failed to make 2 films in a row from the same franchise on par with his own film that started it all but when you haven't been involved in filmmaking for years after losing much of your fortune when you got a divorce thus resulting in no desire to return to your own franchise, it's not exactly expected to be perfect. Lucas just tried to appeal to modern audiences who want visually thrilling CGI, not silly puppetry and childish stop-motion. Attack of the Clones may be a film that's better than The Phantom Menace but still kinda sucks with Teen Vader being grating having already thrown 3 tantrums in the film but it still becomes darker as the stroy progresses foreshadowing the inevitable events to come in the original trilogy."
"Jun 17, 2017",2,This movie is in my very soul...tormenting me!
"Jun 17, 2017",3,Still think it was OK.
"Jun 15, 2017",3.5,not as bad as the first..hayden christ. is unbearable
"Jun 13, 2017",3.5,Average movie.Better than the first tho
"Jun 13, 2017",5,"Ok...How this one has a higher rating than TPM is beyond me.  This is the worst Star Wars film to date.  Why?  Dialogue.  The dialogue in this film is atrocious.  Far worse than TPM.  It doesn't help that Hayden Christensen chose not to act in the film.  I'm pretty sure a cardboard cut out of himself would have given a better performance.
The only saving grace for this film is Jango Fett, which gave us a little back story to Boba and the entertaining start of the Clone Wars.  That Jedi Battle tho, not good at all.  Wasted opportunity."
"Jun 12, 2017",3,"Bad plot and visuals, but more and better action.

6.0/10"
"Jun 10, 2017",3,"Trained to use the force to become a Jedi, hmm? That's Yoda"
"Jun 03, 2017",0.5,"I don't like Attack of the Clones. It's coarse, rough, and it takes you nowhere."
"Jun 01, 2017",3,Lots of Star Wars action that very fun...but wrapped in romantic melodrama and political jabbering that we really could do without.
"May 27, 2017",0.5,"I don't like Attack of the Clones. It's long, dumb, irritating, and its plot is everywhere."
"May 22, 2017",1,"I'm not sure if this or 'The Phantom Menace' is worse but both are very bad movies. Lucas tries to make us care about Anakin and Padme but in the end there isn't much reason to care about them for a number of factors: the acting, the dialogue, the fact that we already know where this is all going. It's just not very interesting. On a side note, I'm also not sure why it was necessary to have a subplot involving Boba Fett's origin story. It felt like lazy fan-service. 'Attack of the Clones' is an unnecessary installment to the franchise and can be skipped over. Even if you are a big Star Wars fan."
"May 17, 2017",2,"I championed this second Star Wars prequel on its release because it 'seemed' more in spirit with the classic trilogy than the disappointing 'Episode 1' which, I felt was basically a kids movie sans heart. Then with the release of the quite solid 'Revenge of the Sith', I saw this one for what it was- a turgid, inter-galactic snoozefest with wooden performances, soap opera dialogue, and effects that were too ambitious for the realism they meant to acheive. Or was it simply a case of too much greenscreen for the actors to perform against? The movie is also painstakingly long and demands more attention than it deserves. Also, due to the fact that we know Anakin will turn to the dark side of the force anyway, how can we accept him as a hero? The narrative is kind of pointless (especially against a soppy unconvincing love story) and only serves to bridge the gap to the final act in the Anakin saga."
"May 15, 2017",2,"I sincerely don't know how they managed to make this one worse than the Phantom Menace, but somehow they did it. This movie makes almost no sense, there is little to no reason for half the decisions made in this film, ranging from the whole business with Jango Fett to the laughable dialogue and petty childish behavior of what is supposed to be the main character of the film, Anakin Skywalker. I could go on and on about why Hayden Christensen is a terrible actor in this installment, but I'll just leave it at that he did not know how to convey any meaningful emotion in this film."
"May 08, 2017",3.5,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones is another REALLY underrated Star Wars Prequel. The movie is good and entertaining. Could some things to the film have been better.. Yes, but is the movie THAT bad.. No. The acting is okay, the story isn't so bad, the action sequences are to be honest not so bad. The CGI is not bad noir good. But the whole movie is good and is not THAT bad, but does have some issues."
"May 06, 2017",2.5,"Episode II in the Star Wars Saga is pretty lackluster. It has some fun action sequences and I really like the emphasis on Obi-Wan's character, but the rest isn't that redeemable. The chemistry between Anakin and Padmé is awful, the special effects haven't aged as well as you might think, and the villain is very poorly done."
"May 04, 2017",2.5,"Attack of the Clones is widely regarded as the worst of the prequels. Aside from some interesting character moments and sub-plots the film comes off as filler. indicated by the opening crawl, things in the galaxy are okay but are about to be turned upside down. Getting to that point however is a very slow ride. Attack of the Clones suffers from much of what The Phantom Menace did. Stiff acting and poor dialogue. Some stand outs however, that  make the material work are Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi, Chrisopher Lee's Count Dooku, and Ian McDiarmid's Palpatine. These actors portray their characters excellently and help the audience invest in the story. Palpatines scheming is more fleshed out in this film and leaves us wanting to see where exactly he plans to go.Obi-Wan's investigation into the Clone Army and action scenes are highlights of the film. Count Dooku makes for an interesting villain. He is doing a necessary evil in order to prevent further evil in his eyes. It makes for some genuinely good dialogue. On the other end of the spectrum, Anakin and Padme's relationship and dialogue is hard to sit through at times. It is difficult to relate or even believe their affection for one another due to the stiff and sometimes creepy dialogue. Some of the set pieces and the excellent music by John Williams make up for this however. There are instance where you can see where George Lucas is going and what he is implying. The greatest part of their time together is spent on Tatooine where we see glimpses of  Anakin's anger and darker side. Hayden Christensen does a good job of displaying what Anakin is feeling, especially when he sees his mother beaten and on the verge of death. The music and results of that scene are great and carry weight. The climax of the film is visually interesting. Much of the CGI doesn't hold up quite that well but it isn't horrible. The Clone Army in action was a cool sight and the camera work is unique and adds a grittiness to the battle. The ending lightsaber duel is lackluster but its's results are satisfying. Overall Attack of the Clones feels like filler with some cool visuals and character moments, held back by poor writing and abandoned sub-plots."
"May 03, 2017",2.5,"why the hell George luca brings same Problem they don't fit this squinty, gently l deny he made up all over again at least action and Music sequence confidently promise Blame Boring Plot.

"May 03, 2017",3,"Better than Episode I by a LONG SHOT, but still heavily flawed."
"Apr 30, 2017",1,"Si el Episodio Uno la considero una ""mala"" película a la que le tengo cierto cariño...esta es un desastre por la que no siento más que un odio profundo.

Y no es que esté exanta de elementos interesantes. Algo que me gusta de la trilogía es su trama política, que si bien es simplona, al menos contextualiza muy bien el universo, especialmente a la hora de construir el Imperio de la trilogía clásica.

Pero ahí se acaba todo. Lo demás es pura mierda. El personaje de Anakin es odioso y está escrito de pena. La actuación de Christensen es de escándalo (de lo desastrosa que es). Natalie Portman parece que está por allí de paso (aunque en la tercera será aun peor). Esa historia de amor....ay, madre...esa historia de amor. ¿George Lucas ha tenido alguna relación amorosa sana en su vida? Por que sin duda esta no solo no parece real, sino que es tan tóxica que da miedo. 

Por supuesto ese supuesto ""descenso a las tinieblas"" de Anakin es tan torpe (incluso teniendo buenos elementos de base) que da la sensación de que uno de los villanos más increibles de toda la historia nace de una rabieta de quincieñero en edad del pavo. La serie de Tartakovsky lo hacía mucho mejor en un episodio de 5 minutos...

Señores, estas son las bases de la gran epopeya que se construirá a continuación, y no solo son ridiculas...sino que son poco creibles.

En fin...la peor de la saga, y un insulto a la gran franquicia que es Star Wars...horrible."

"Apr 09, 2017",2,"""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"", while it is more watchable than its predecessor, proves to be a worse film still. The performances have no depth to them (in particular Christensen and Portman), though we are given a great performance from McGregor.

reason-bad dialouges,bad acting,poorly executed action sequences and biggest thing THE TITLE OF THE DAMN MOVIE
SPOILERS




If clone army is helping the jedi masters than why the hell the title says attack of the clones 

IT JUST SUCKS"
"Apr 02, 2017",4,"Solid, but not as good as the first."
"Mar 31, 2017",5,"Star Wars Episode II Attack Of The Clones is often the Star Wars movie people tend to just not talk about.  It is often stated to be to long and drawn out and with out the feel of Star Wars. Attack Of The Clones, though isn't a normal Star Wars. It is a love story and a mystery story. It's very romantic yet ominous. Plenty of nods to The Empire Strikes Back. Our heros are split up and we find our characters in a dark situation. The dialogue between Anakin and Padmé is often laughed at. It is t the most real relation ship we would find in the real world. But think about it. Anakin has never really been with a girl he has the hot for before. He has spent the last 10 years in the Jedi Order where they say he has to be mindful of his feelings. He is going to come off very rough around the edges and akward. Episode II perfectly continues what Episode I left us off with despite the 10 year gap between the events of the two films. The Jedi are cautious to get involved in growing political tensions to not start a war. The Jedi are also being mindful of Anakin's training and trying to find the sith. The Mystery and investigating part of Episode II is truly the best part of the movie. Seeing what a Jedi investigation is like is very exciting. Episode II leaves many other mysteries to be left explained like Why and How the Cline Army was commissioned and why did Count Dooku leave the Jedi Order. Seeing Palpatine groom Anakin the way Anakin wants because he feel is he isn't getting the positive feedback from his Jedi Peers. Anakin's struggle in this film gives you the smallest taste of his inevitable fall from grace to be Darth Vader."
"Mar 26, 2017",4,"Fun film, great action!!!"
"Mar 26, 2017",5,"Really enjoyed it, had flaws but really enjoyed it also natalie portman is gorgeous"
"Mar 24, 2017",4,"Ok, Episode II is definitely better than Episode 1. Especially the first couple of minutes with all the action and chase sequence. So weird to see how the Clone Troopers came about. Basically they took the genetic code from Jango Fett and they started making human clones that would become trained soldiers that would fight for the Republic. 

I noticed that there's a lot more good action sequences in this episode. Like the fight between Jango Fett and Obi Wan on Kamino. Then the ship chase scene between them where Jango tries to blow Obi Wan with bombs, flying through an asteroid field. 

Episode II is definitely more grown up than Episode I. Nobody really says it, but R2 is the GOAT. He's always saving everybody's life. He saved Padme's life when she was stuck in that huge wooden cup. He puts 3PO back together during the battle of Geonosis. He saved Luke, Leia and Solo when they were stuck in that garbage compactor.

That battle of Geonosis is so good, so badass so much action. This is the movie that made me love Yoda so much. He's so badass and so quick even with his old age. Still strong. 

Basically, Episode II benefits from its good use of action sequences and special effects. Acting seemed better than the first and thank God Jar Jar didn't play that big of a role in this one. It was interesting to see the formation and creation of the clone troopers and where they came from."
"Mar 23, 2017",1.5,"The absolute worst Star Wars cannon film to date. I didn't think that it could get much worse than the Phantom Menace, but boy was I wrong. This is a absolute bore. The characters are terrible and the worst of all the the primary protagonist, Skywalker. He just can't act very well and delivers just wooden lines throughout the entire film. The only saving grace is Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan. He is even given just garbage to work with through this snooze fest of a film."
"Mar 15, 2017",4.5,"The movie that made my elementary school career. I was pulled in from the beginning and wasn't let go until the end. A great second act in a wonderful franchise, and the first that starts to add a bit of nuance to the series. I really enjoy seeing Ani grow up and find his place in the world."
"Mar 10, 2017",3,"""I don't like sand""."
"Mar 09, 2017",5,Good action sequences but that's about it
"Mar 04, 2017",2,"The opening sequence had a need shiny ship that descending towards coruscant.  That whole part was visually stunning.  The was another part where Obi-wan and Anakin chase after a bounty hunter among a highway of airspeeders.  This movie has some good parts, like the ones I just mention.  Two good parts.  Two stars."
"Mar 04, 2017",2.5,"In fact, this movie is a little bit better than 'The Phantom Menace', but it not reaches the quality of the original films."
"Feb 26, 2017",2.5,"Okay, this one was better than the last, but still, the fight between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi and Count Dooku was dull."
"Feb 25, 2017",4,"It wasn't the best Star Wars movie ever made, but it definatly has its moments that make it stand out from the other movies in the saga."
"Feb 21, 2017",1,"I once said that Star Wars Episode 5 is better than Episode 4 because it improves upon it in every way. That's what sequels should be like. However, this movie manages to do the exact opposite, managing to be even worse than Episode 1 and amplifying every problem I had with Episode 1. Awful love story, even worse acting, even worse characters, and an over reliance on CGI. Although I will give credit where it is due, the CGI looks better, but it's still pretty bad, and it's in every scene. The only interesting part of the movie for me was the war between the droid army and clone army, and of course, we only get to see at least 30 seconds of their battle."
"Feb 08, 2017",2,"Unfortunately, attack of the clones manages to have the exact same results and the phantom menace. It's boring, characters have no development, the CGI is terrible, the acting is terrible, and the dialogue is even worse than the phantom menace. The story is horribly executed, and the love story has become a meme at this point because of how terrible it is."
"Feb 04, 2017",4,"People like to hate this movie because of the 3% of the movie's runtime that Anakin is being an awkward teenager, and frankly, this movie does not deserve that. Ewan McGregor is BRILLIAN in this movie, and Hayden Christiansen isn't nearly as bad as people make him out to be, considering the lines he's expected to deliver. But Anakin is a hormonal teen, and honestly, his portrayal of this character is spot-on. Yes, it definitely could use some touching up, and it is not the best of the Star Wars films, but it is fun to watch, and only stupid for around 5 minutes."
"Feb 04, 2017",2,"I championed this second Star Wars prequel on its release because it 'seemed' more in spirit with the classic trilogy than the disappointing 'Episode 1' which, I felt was basically a kids movie sans heart. Then with the release of the quite solid 'Revenge of the Sith', I saw this one for what it was- a turgid, inter-galactic snoozefest with wooden performances, soap opera dialogue, and effects that were too ambitious for the realism they meant to acheive. Or was it simply a case of too much greenscreen for the actors to perform against? The movie is also painstakingly long and demands more attention than it deserves. Also, due to the fact that we know Anakin will turn to the dark side of the force anyway, how can we accept him as a hero? The narrative is kind of pointless (especially against a soppy unconvincing love story) and only serves to bridge the gap to the final act in the Anakin saga."
"Jan 31, 2017",2,"Another half baked, badly written prequel with the most unsympathetic, whiny, annoying Anakin Skywalker, some badly over the top action, even more CGI and a story so dull you just want to fall asleep."
"Jan 24, 2017",1.5,"Tedious, hard to follow, and too many annoying characters that barely make this movie worth seeing..."
"Jan 24, 2017",0.5,One of the worst things that ever happened to cinema
"Jan 23, 2017",2.5,"Terrible movie features two CGI armies. Obi Wan's story can be a little interesting, but Anikan and Padme's romance drags the movie down."
"Jan 23, 2017",4,Entertaining but too much CGI
"Jan 23, 2017",4,"Although not the greatest Star Wars, there's still fun to be had. The middle of the movie can get a little slow, but there are enough elements thrown in there to keep you engaged for the spectacular finish. Some may blame Christensen for his ""bad acting"", but I think it's the script that holds him back from being a great Anakin. Overall, a fun movie that at least sets up Revenge of the Sith well."
"Jan 19, 2017",4.5,Star Wars: Attack of The Clones is an exciting and masterful movie- from its well played characters to its epic battle scenes. One of the best installments in the series!
"Jan 11, 2017",3,Nota: 5.9/10 - 2.9/5
"Jan 07, 2017",3,"Also another mediocre Star Wars movie and bad acting is the main cause of it. It is a ""meh"" movie."
"Jan 03, 2017",4,"Anakin and Padme are disappointing, underachieving characters. Also, a good amount of the overall chosen dialog is unnecessary. Other than those blemishes Attack of the Clones still lives up to epic Star Wars form with its action and beautiful scenery."
"Jan 02, 2017",2.5,"Contrary to popular belief, this is far inferior to The Phantom Menace. Don't get me wrong this is still better than most movies because, come on, it's Star Wars; but the romance between Anakin and Padame is boring and something I skip when ever I watch it. However, The ending is awesome and my favorite battle scene of any movie ever!"
"Jan 02, 2017",3,"Lots of action, but little character development."
"Dec 31, 2016",2,"Has almost the exact same problems with ""The Phantom Menace"", but this time suffering from an incoherent plot and underdeveloped characters. Making this one a complete bore."
"Dec 28, 2016",3.5,Objectively terrible but my heart doesn't care. Probably the best of the prequels.
"Dec 27, 2016",3.5,"I liked this one better than episode 1, but it wasn't as easy to watch. This one is darker but has some fun action. Anakin is annoying but that isn't that bad. I'd recommend it."
"Dec 27, 2016",2.5,Though awesome action is offered there is an abundant amount of underdevoled characters making it the worst Star Wars installment.
"Dec 27, 2016",2,":l

Okay but the cloners are really great creature designs I remember being super inspired by them when i was little and tbh still see aspects of them show up in my artwork now."
"Dec 23, 2016",3,"It improves with better action scenes and visual effects (and less Jar Jar Binks), though it still suffers from clumsy pacing, some lazy acting, and a forced romance."
"Dec 22, 2016",1,One of the worst star wars movies ever because the casting and writing was horrible. Waste of money and talent. They should remake the entire prequel series.
"Dec 20, 2016",3,"It is upsetting to see a film with phenomenal concept being poorly executed with unnecessary fillers. This is how the prequels should have started and then made us as viewers uncover the life behind Anakin and the rise of the clone army. Overall, the dialogue feels like a updated version of Mcbeth, the cinematography is adequate, the characters were innovated perfectly but the story made a wall that is hard to climb if I want to connect with them. Example being Anakins and Padme romantic subplot was oddly bland and didn't make me excited to see them together. On a positive note its a fun watch and great universe."
"Dec 17, 2016",3,"Pretty cool, but pretty boring at times."
"Dec 17, 2016",2,"When Phantom Menace was dull, Attack of the Clones leans more on frustrating with a never-ending cycle of annoying plot devices and hideous acting which I've seen repel even the most loyal Star Wars fans. For a movie that was supposed to develop Annakin's character. Episode II does great disservice to Darth Vader."
"Dec 16, 2016",5,It was good could of been Better
"Dec 16, 2016",3,"Honestly, this is probably the best of the three prequels. The Revenge of the Sith had no plot. It was just a mop up and with a lot of action. The Phantom Menace just sucks in every way imaginable. The Attack of the Clones has a car chase, lightsaber battles, huge battle at the end, and the closest thing you'll get to a love scene in any of the movies. Also, a narcissistic dude who kills a bunch of people out of anger. Entertaining... even if it isn't good."
"Dec 16, 2016",2,"Sadly not much of an improvement on The Phantom Menace. Once again, the effects are good, and occasionally there'll be something kind of cool, but nothing cool enough to make up for the atrocious dialogue (""I don't like sand""), wooden acting and dull, drawn-out story. The love story at the center fails to engage (Christensen and Portman have no chemistry, and the character of Anakin is honestly kind of a creep), and Lucas still favors visuals over story. The Force is not strong with this one."
"Dec 15, 2016",2.5,"It's alright. It's probably the worst live action Star Wars entry. It shows ridiculous promise, especially with Obi-Wan's scenes and Christopher Lee's scenes. Unfortunately, this promise is squandered by the awful romance plot between Anakin and Padme and lackluster special effects. Despite this, it's worth a watch."
"Dec 15, 2016",2,Doesn't improve since The Phantom Menace with a load of faults and awful writing. And don't even get me started on Hayden Christensens character.
"Dec 13, 2016",0.5,need to balance the score
"Dec 13, 2016",5,"I don't like and its course, rough, and gets everywhere"
"Dec 12, 2016",2,"""OK this sequel to the prequel trilogy was so bad, it made 'The Phantom Menace' look good. This here is my LEAST Favorite in the entire saga! However the visuals are not bad, the action sequences including Yoda vs. Dooku were pretty impressive, and the score is actually quite good. A few problems I have with this film is the fact that it's a romance film between Anikan and Padmé and the dialogue in this film between them and other characters are so cringe worthy on so many levels! I mean really, who talks about sand? NO ONE! It's uncomfortable!"""
"Dec 11, 2016",2,"I may be in the minority, but I feel this is the low point of a great franchise. Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman are beyond awkward in the romance. The high point is Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. All in all, not bad, but not good either."
"Dec 07, 2016",2.5,"MUCH better than Phantom Menace, but is still weak. However the action scenes do save this film, even if the acting and writing is bland and awful!"
"Dec 04, 2016",3,Worst Star Wars movie I hated the plot but there was good effects and action.
"Nov 28, 2016",3,"Interesting efforts to expand the characters, but we are left feeling like something was rushed."
"Nov 25, 2016",2,"Attack of the Clones suffers from a poor leading actor, a strange and awkward love story, a pathetic villain, and once again a facade of CGI images, but Yoda's light saber skills are worth the viewing."
"Nov 24, 2016",3.5,"Attack of the Clones has a lot of new information under a weak script, whick makes it the less compelling chapter of the franchise, but it nevertheless boasts some amazing action sequences."
"Nov 21, 2016",1.5,The only good part of this movie was the huge battle. It was great to watch and I have gone back to this movie solely to watch that part. Everything else is pretty boring.
"Nov 10, 2016",2.5,"The only reasons why this film is better than Phantom Menace is because (1) more scenes actually contribute to the general plot of the trilogy and (2) there were some great action scenes. Seeing a bunch of Jedi battle on Geonosis along with Yoda fighting with a lightsaber are a few things that fulfilled my childhood dreams. Other than that, this movie was poor, which was a shame due to it's great potential."
"Oct 30, 2016",2.5,"Ever so slightly better than Phantom Menace, but still crap. At least for Star Wars. Hayden Christensen is AWFUL. His dialogue is awful (though that's not entirely his fault), but the action is pretty good, and the Across the Stars theme is great, and thank GOD Jar-Jar isn't in this movie a lot."
"Oct 28, 2016",2,"This earns an extra star because it's Star Wars, but the best time to enjoy this movie is when you have friends over and you drink a truck load of the strongest beer in town. ""It's coarse and rough and irritating... and it gets everywhere."" That line... cringey and hilarious at once."
"Oct 18, 2016",2,"Nja, längtar nog till nr 4!"
"Oct 13, 2016",3,Definitely an improvement on the Phantom Menace.Attack of the Clones was kinda great and Lucas' method of building Anakin Skywalker is well appreciated by me..
"Oct 09, 2016",4,"Attack of the Clones is a great film with a powerful third act. The practical effects are actually present in the film and the effects are great for their time. It has a beautiful score by John Williams, arguably his best and has iconic/memorable performances from Ewan Mcgregor, Natalie Portman, Christopher Lee, and Samuel L. Jackson. Though Hayden Christensen is unbearably cringy, the rest of the film is truly great and my second favorite of the prequel trilogy. It also has great production design and they do sexualize Natalie Portman too much but itâ(TM)s Natalie Portman. Solid 8/10"
"Oct 06, 2016",3.5,"A roller coaster of opinions take sway in the analysis of this film. With Lucas at the helm, many blame him for what is an all time low of acting and chemistry between Cristianson and Portman's major lead roles with the notable exception of McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi. This was not aided by a frank lack of character development and exceedingly rushed plot lines with the sudden addition of Lee's (albeit very well portrayed) Count Dooku. Though, masterful CGI and never-before seen action sequences do raise merit for the films; with epic lightsaber action and interstellar dogfights. Whilst highly criticised, the politics continues to bring an interesting aspect to this highly loved universe; not to mention, the evident lack of Jar Jar Binks was a welcome change to its predecessor. Whether fans accept it or not, the film is not abysmal, and brings new life into the dedicated fandom that is 'Star Wars'."
"Oct 04, 2016",1.5,"In my opinion star wars episode 1 is better than this one. If I watch it I want to go to sleep. If you haven't seen this movie, don't see it. Do yourself a favor."
"Sep 27, 2016",4,"Solid movie, but far from the perfection of the original trilogy."
"Sep 19, 2016",4.5,"One of my favorites from the ever growing saga. To see Grand Master Yoda in action, the ignition of the Clone Wars, Jango Fett engage Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu, the arena battle and the genesis of the emotions that would give birth to Darth Vader all make for a brilliant ride!"
"Sep 11, 2016",3,More action packed and less Jar Jar thank god!
"Sep 06, 2016",1.5,Disappointing but better than the Phantom Menace.
"Sep 04, 2016",3,"With the action better executed and the story told with energy this time round, Episode II is a more entertaining entry to the saga than its forgotten predecessor, but not exactly more impressive.  It inevitably carries the problems that the trilogy started with - slanted acting, cheap VFX, wasted A-listers - and creates new ones (lifeless romance, wining acting) that can only do less justice to the saga than ever before."
"Aug 31, 2016",5,"Wonderful movie! Reveals Anakin Skyealker story in beautiful manner, with great music."
"Aug 26, 2016",3,"I agree it is undeniably bad. But like Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, I enjoyed for what Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones could only offer."
"Aug 23, 2016",2,"Somehow finding a way to be even worse than the Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones is a disaster from start to finish. The movie is centered around a horribly acted love story that nobody cares about, features more Jar Jar Binks, and once manages to disappoint fans by having Boba Fett appear, only to have him be a total loser and then die awkwardly all over again. There's all that bad and I honestly don't have one good thing to say about this movie. 

You should definitely skip this one. You gain nothing by watching this stinker."
"Aug 21, 2016",2,Once again the new era of Star Wars fails to impress. In all fairness this is a much more exciting and action packed film compared to Episode 1 but still falls short of the fans expectations. It's not completely terrible and its an okay yet cringeworthy watch for a Friday night but once again this new era fails to reach the blockbuster heights of its predecessor. If you watch this film don't expect or compare it to the original trilogy otherwise you shall not enjoy the film what so ever. If you would rather consider it as a sequel to the also terrible Phantom Menace then you may class it as an improvement and may even enjoy moments of this film.
"Aug 20, 2016",0.5,Absolutely awful film. Terribly boring and awful acting from Portman. The script is dire. Today must be the worst character in the film. Hate the way he talks and the fight scene is clearly ripped off much better films. Dull dull dull film. 
"Aug 20, 2016",1.5,not as bad as The phantom menace but still pretty bad.
"Aug 20, 2016",3,"Not The Best, But Not Awful"
"Aug 19, 2016",2,"The second film in the prequel trilogy, and my 3rd or 4th time viewing it, my opinions on it are roughly the same as my other viewings. It is not as bad as the previous film the Phantom Menace, but it still is a far cry from a decent Star Wars film. What props Episode II up over Episode I is the inclusion of several new characters and actors such as Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), which help elevate the film over it's predecessor. Some of the returning characters and actors also help elevate the film as they either have improved from the last film, like that of Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan, or simply appear more in the film than previously, such as Samuel Jackson's Mace Windu and Frank Oz's Yoda. The CGI in the film is improved from the previous, though there are still points in which you are taken out of immersion due to the contrast between real life actors and CGI backgrounds or characters. However, this is generally where the positives end. While all of the points above sound great and make one think that the film should hold a much higher rating than the 2/5 stars I have given it, the problem lies in the writing, the core of the story, and the wasted potential of the film. The movie is messy to put it simply, the main driving force in this film is the development of Anakin's feelings for Padme and her feelings for him. You are supposed to see the two slowly fall in love and form a bond so strong that even Jedi vows can't tear them apart, you are supposed to see Anakin's slow descent and drift away from the Jedi Order and toward the emotional Dark Side. However, the film horribly fails to convince you of any of it. Even down to the barest level of emotion, the writing team does a poor job developing the characters. Anakin comes off as a whiny, brat with a down right creepy fixation for Padme. There are scenes in which Anakin (played by Hayden Christensen) literally looks like a stalker. On the flip side, Padme is supposed to be falling for him, you should see the love and chemistry start to flow between the two. But Padme only ever looks like she is uncomfortable and creeped out, she never seems in love. So when the climax between these two occurs and the love is let out into the open air, you just simply don't believe it. Couple that with the cringe writing (I'm sure we all know about the ""I hate sand"" comment), you get what feels like a romance movie that was created by a middle school student. There is so much wrong with this movie that, while I did find myself enjoying Count Dooku's presence, Mace Windu and Yoda actually doing something, and Obi-Wan improving as a character, it is such a small batch of positives that can't outweigh the horrid writing and travesty that was supposed to be the main plot point of the film. Next up in my Star Wars chronological list will be the Mace Windu comic and the Clone Wars television cartoon. I have heard excellent things about both and sincerely hope that they are leagues better than... whatever it was this was supposed to be."
"Aug 17, 2016",2,"This is my favorite. Because of action, FX and drama tension."
"Aug 14, 2016",0.5,"This movie is boring, joyless, horribly acted, and is the worst movie I've ever seen. This ruined my favourite Star Wars character as well, Boba Fett. Jango is chasing Obi-Wan and Boba is sitting there saying ""get him dad, fire!"" Worst movie I've ever seen!"
"Aug 09, 2016",1,I don't even want to talk about it.
"Aug 09, 2016",2.5,"There were so many brilliant casting decisions.  Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiarmid...  So as it happens the one part that was critical to cast well?  It's not Hayden C's fault.  I would have taken that role in a heartbeat two and would only have been a 10th as good.  So it is."
"Aug 09, 2016",0.5,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is an abysmal film and an embarrassment to the Star Wars Franchise. Never before has there been a film so bad in the history of humanity, and I doubt there will ever be one this bad again."
"Aug 08, 2016",5,"While I really love the entire series, I actually remember episodes IV, V and VI more than episodes I-III. 

It's nice to remember the background behind Anakin's fall into the dark side."
"Aug 07, 2016",2,"This film has a few great moments but mixed in with that a pointless love story that keeps the pace of the film at a snails pace, the second half is better then the first but not worth slogging through this to watch it."
"Aug 07, 2016",3.5,A okay cast put into a okay script with great visual effects totals into an okay movie.
"Aug 04, 2016",2.5,"Where you'd think that this film would try very hard to be a better viewing experience than its predecessor, it surprisingly ends ups being a worse one. The story is average at best, the two main characters are horribly developed, the sense of wonder and galactic exploration is gone, and the action sequences are bland and just not that great. What's more, this film as a whole is really just a big bore, even when it's trying hard not to be. However, it isn't all bad. While the main characters might be terrible, the rest of the cast is actually wonderful. And while the story is average at best, it is (at least) much more interesting than in the previous film. The visuals still look incredible, and while the action sequences are bland, they do offer much more variety. And what's more, the film does feel darker and more foreshadowing to what is to come. While I do personally find that this is a worse film than ""The Phantom Menace"", it does try at least to do things better, and it does succeed in certain areas. It may be worse, but I do appreciate that it's trying newer things to be different than its predecessor. All in all, it's really just an average film at best."
"Aug 03, 2016",5,"It,s ok but still jar jar Binks In the film"
"Jul 28, 2016",1,"The worst and most disappointing Star Wars film of all time. Clunky, overused CGI make this film look like a rip off of itself. George Lucas doesn't understand how to write dialogue or direct actors yet again. The most hyped up battle in all of Star Wars lore ends up being the most boring thing about this film which is an impressive feat."
"Jul 25, 2016",1.5,"As the story of Anakin continues, the film still has a bumpy pacing, and is still overloaded with VFX."
"Jul 25, 2016",3,"Though its more intresting and straight up better  than Phantom Menace the film is brought down heavily by an awkward and forced romance,bad scripting choices,heavy use of CGI,slow uneven pacing,and underdeveloped characters but aside that it can be considered ""watch able"""
"Jul 23, 2016",1.5,"dude, this is so much worse."
"Jul 23, 2016",1.5,"Coming off the heels of the fun and visually excellent Phantom Menace, Episode II's incurable illness of a bad screenplay, horrible dialogue, and unacceptable acting makes it on par with Revenge of the Sith for the worst Star Wars film."
"Jul 22, 2016",2,"It has its moments, but is ultimately a terrible love story with horrid dialogue and acting, and an incredible overuse of CGI. Easily the worst of the saga."
"Jul 21, 2016",5,Star Wars episode 2 attack of the Clones was a good start a revealing Secrets behind the Clone Wars.      revealing secrets of Anakin Skywalker's past after the death of his mom he turned to the dark side in turmoil turned as when he became Darth Vader is known as his hatred for Obi-Wan Kenobi.       backstory with a hard on for the Clone Wars story Business movie rating of 10.1
"Jul 20, 2016",4,the worst Star Wars movie but still adds many new things to the Star Wars universe has good scenery and has average action scenes
"Jul 19, 2016",2.5,"Worse than the first one. I remember loving the Yoda fight... until I thought about how much it doesn't make sense. When you're a kid as I was when I saw it, the horrifically cheesy ""love"" story doesn't grate on you like it does as an adult."
"Jul 19, 2016",0.5,"The even worse follow up to shit epi 1 this movie has less Jar Jar thank god but has an even worse Anakin ,stupid romance and more boring shit and wodden acting and also has the worst Lightsaber battles of the entire franchise."
"Jul 18, 2016",3,Quite possibly the worst Star Wars movie ever put to theaters and that's saying something.  There are some unforgettable action scenes but there are also cringe worthy dialogue.
"Jul 17, 2016",3.5,It can be sorta boring for the first 2 acts but every thing that happens on geonosis is just awesome the 3rd act alone is worth watching.
"Jul 15, 2016",1.5,"Hayden Christensons performance as Anakin is a disaster, the relationship with Anakin and Padme is forced and cringe worthy to watch and makes me want to switch the movie off, it's my least favourite in the franchise and I'll probably only watch it if I'm drunk"
"Jul 12, 2016",3,"The story arc begun in The Phantom Menace lumbered on and improved considerably in Attack of the Clones but, to be honest, it still didn't sparkle with the energy and vitality of the original Star Wars movies. The main problem here is the unbearable script with lines that are delivered in a completely cack-handed manner. The plot of this movie is much better than its predecessor dealing as it does with the production of two secret armies being prepared for nefarious reasons. There are some exciting set pieces and action sequences and good effects but the developing love story between Padmé and Anakin is clumsy and passionless. There are a few geeky continuity references which aren't really needed and add nothing to the saga. Viewed as a stand alone piece, Attack of the Clones looks good and has a dollop of big screen action but sadly it really only serves to remind just how great those first three Star Wars originals had been."
"Jul 09, 2016",2,"Worst of all the Star Wars too much Anikan pad me love story

Love Jedi storm and Yoda at end best scene ever all else I could go without 

Interesting also hearing about clones and jango fett but wanted more detail"
"Jul 09, 2016",3,"Attack of the Clones is certainly more action packed than it's predecessor, but features characters that don't work. Anakin is supposed to be more grown up in this film, but still acts like a winy child. Count Dooku is not intimidating at all and comes across as an elderly gentlemen rather than a Sith. Instead of Jar Jar, we get awkward romance dialogue between Anakin and Padme. Overall this film is definitely the worst in the Star Wars saga."
"Jul 09, 2016",2,"My least favorite Star Wars movie, but still has cool moments in it, like the Arena scene, but still is plagued by horrible dialogue, and a forced love story."
"Jul 05, 2016",2,Dialogue is horrible and do things that are different then what they had preciously said (Yoda at the end)
"Jul 04, 2016",1,The only event that happens between the start and the end of the film is Anakin's realisation that it's slightly harder to masturbate.
"Jul 02, 2016",2.5,"I love star wars but WHAT THE HELL GEORGE LUCAS?!

Just, no."
"Jun 28, 2016",1,"""i don't like sand. its coarse, rough, irritating, and it gets EVERYWHERE"""
"Jun 22, 2016",3,"This was George Lucas's attempt to appease the fans for what he did in Episode I. Despite the film being better, it still felt a little flat. The story deepened a bit and Ewan McGregor still turned in a very strong performance as Obi Wan Kenobi, but Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin Skywalker seemed very ""emo"" and whiny. Maybe this was the director and the script's fault, but Christensen turned many (including myself) off to this character. Best part of the film is the Count Dooku lightsaber duel at the end of the film. Many did NOT see it coming and it was pretty enjoyable."
"Jun 21, 2016",0.5,"Combining horrendous writing and lackluster acting, Attack of the Clones hits a low point for the Star Wars franchise."
"Jun 19, 2016",1,"The absolute worst of the franchise. Terrible script, bland and completely stilted performances, really bad effects of CGI that overuses on top of the practical effects and making it feel like a videogame and artificially lifeless, the worst romance I've ever seen in a film, blind fan service as an insult to me as a fan, one dimensional characters and what feels like a pointless film as it adds nothing to the story."
"Jun 18, 2016",1,"George Lucas tries and fails to create a timeless epic. The directing is terrible, the actors clearly don't know what to do and additionally the film is almost entirely done in green screen; this overuse of CGI makes the film look unbelievable and  looks dated when compared to modern technology. The only good thing is Obi Wan and he barely has any screen time as well as an uninteresting subplot. Just skip this one, it's not even laugh out loud bad it's simply dull. If you want that watch the phantom menace."
"Jun 08, 2016",2.5,"With a combination of too much CG and an underdeveloped story, Attack of the Clones falls short of its potential. If you're looking for sweet action with blaster guns and explosions, then this is an excellent film for the entertainment. However, I feel there was no passion in the production of Attack of the Clones which left me feeling dissatisfied with what this Star Wars film could have been. Anikan and Padme's romance story arc is awkward as ever, and the acting and dialogue felt completely unnatural. The only character storyline that was interesting was Obi Wan Kenobi's since it actually added value to the Clone Wars story.

Attack of the Clones is just okay and very standard. 2.5 Stars"
"May 31, 2016",3.5,Better than The Phantom Menace but that's not saying a lot. And Hayden Christiansen is just annoying and whiny. I'll give credit for the story though and Ewan McGregor's solid performance!
"May 29, 2016",4,"Improvement over episode 2. Storyline is solid but lacks the intimate details from the novel which would have made it a great film. Love how the clone army was created in secret and how jango is the template. Great action scene through out the film. Also like the politics behind the scenes. 

Only drawback was the romance between a anakin and padame. Could have added a few more scenes showing how their love grew. 

Over a good film"
"May 28, 2016",1,"It seems that every time a good Star Wars film is made, they follow it up the worst way imaginable. Never did I think that George Lucas could make a Star Wars film that was worse than Return of the Jedi. This one's awfully close. Where do I begin?!?! The plot is all over the place. Obi Wan is investigating the attempted assassination of Senator Padme Amidala and comes across a clone army made on Jedi Master Sifo Dyas' order. But in the movie, the jedi believe he died before the army could've been made. So who ordered the army?? I guess it's a plot point that'll never be answered. Meanwhile, Anakin is supposed to be protecting Padme. First of all, Hayden Christensen's acting is an abomination. C3PO can deliver lines less robotic than Christensen. He's not completely at fault though. The writers do an awful job at developing Anakin's character. This is the man that is one day going to be Darth Vader and he's acting like a whiny little brat. But I guess Luke had to pick it up from somewhere. The writers also try and force a ludicrous romance between Anakin and Padme. Christensen and Natalie Portman have no chemistry between them. The dialogue is laughable as well as the circumstances. Why would the jedi assign a Padawan to protect Senator Amidala?? Wouldn't they want an experienced Jedi?? You can pick this movie apart any way shape or form. It's just a complete mess."
"May 24, 2016",0.5,SOMEHOW THIS ONE IS EVEN WORST THE FREAKIN PHANTOM MENACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 22, 2016",2.5,Overly romantic and very poor acting and story.
"May 21, 2016",2.5,"The Phantom Menace was a strong success financially, something which mostly came down to the massive hype surrounding it; yet despite the mixed reactions to the film in 1999, fans nevertheless remained hopeful for the middle chapter of the prequel trilogy. Episode II marked the moment we were introduced to Anakin Skywalker as a young man, the form he possessed before falling to the dark side. While Attack of the Clones does make some minor improvements, scars that remain from the first film still hold it back.

Attack of the Clones picks up ten years after Episode I; tensions are rising in the Republic with several races and planets leaving to form the Separatist movement. With a massive droid army at their disposal, both the Galactic Senate and the Jedi Council are concerned that war is approaching. Whilst this political struggle is going on, Anakin Skywalker, deep in training under Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor) grows closer to Padme Amidala; (Natalie Portman) he is assigned to protect her from assassination while his master attempts to investigate who ordered the hit. From the offset, it's clear that there's a lot more going on here and while Episode II still has its moments of boring, drawn out scenes, most notably the scenes with Anakin and Padme, it does a better job of breaking these up with more action packed moments. From the city chase through Coruscant to the brief showdown between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, much of the action feels much more extravagant and sustained than Episode I. Not only that, but you can see the strings of the Chancellor's plans slowly coming to fruition with the entrance of the Clone Army and his careful manipulation of the Senate. In its latter half, Episode II begins a build-up process, laying the foundations for something which culminates in the Clone Wars and the film's sequel Revenge of the Sith; this is greatly personified with Anakin losing his mother to the Tusken Raiders around halfway into the film. We can feel the seeds of anger growing within him and this gives the audience a first glimpse into the gradual downfall of the character. Much like The Phantom Menance, Episode II explodes into action towards the end, only this time working to incorporate in more characters and factions into the proceedings.

While the narrative has taken a step forward or two, the characters unfortunately have not. The most glaring flaws in the cast this time come through Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman respectively. This really is some of the most awkward, forced and clichéd romantic dialogue that has ever been put on film; it's impossible to believe or take their so called ""romance"" seriously and yet it takes up a good portion of the film, distracting from the far better done action scenes. Hayden Christensen isn't a particularly bad actor; I've seen him give a strong performance in Shattered Glass, but here the material given to him drags the film down from good to simply average. What exacerbates things here is that he's the main protagonist, the one person that we're supposed to root for. How can we do this when he's constantly alternating between dull emotionless dialogue and moaning at people? For every moment of genuine emotion, there are five which fall flat. Thankfully, the other characters are again present to make up for things; McGregor's performance is great once again, creating a believable and varied portrayal of Obi-Wan. The Jedi Council isn't just sitting around in this film; they have a more realised participation in Episode II. The final member of the cast is Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, who brings a relatively good performance with subdued conversation and solid swordplay to the film; considering that he's introduced towards the film's final act, I only wish he was given more to do.

Building on what was established in its predecessor, Episode II continues to introduce more diverse planets and locations to the series; the water soaked cloning labs of Kamino have a particularly gloomy atmosphere to them and on the opposite side of the coin we have Geonosis, a run-down, dusty and gritty setting which serves a strong backdrop to the opening battle of the Clone Wars. We are also given a wider insight into the Jedi temple on Coruscant and go further afield in Naboo; it's a strong step towards creating a greater scale and more far reaching worlds. These newer planets are accompanied by an expanded selection of theme songs which are swapped seamlessly depending on the location. While the computer effects worked into every shot still aren't the best in class, there are far fewer moments where characters are shoved in front of the camera, lessening the negative impact they had previously. With a few tentative steps forward in presentation, Attack of the Clones can make a stronger claim to immerse the audience, something which would be much improved in Episode III.

Attack of the Clones is really a film of two halves; one made of frantic, fast paced action sequences and the other riddled with painfully stiff and pretentious ""romantic chemistry"". It succeeds at standing above The Phantom Menace, but that isn't really saying much when you consider how flawed the two central leads are. Just as the film sits in the middle of the prequel trilogy, it does the same in terms of overall quality."

"May 10, 2016",1.5,(1.5/5) Marginally better. Anakin displays Godsmack/Papa Roach-levels of hypemasc whiny angst throughout. Still racist. One more to go.
"May 10, 2016",2,"I enjoyed this movie as a preteen but as soon as you are old enough to see past the sword fighting and arena duels you realize how unsuccessful Lucas is at portraying love, friendship, or really any emotions you would expect these characters to be feeling. In addition to this not a single scene looks real. It is a mish-mash of confused actors in fake places spouting words unconvincingly."
"May 06, 2016",2.5,"Attack of the Clones is marginally better than The Phantom Menace in that the audience doesn't feel condescended to by including Muppet Baby Darth Vader and a CGI Jamaican rabbit. Jar Jar's role is scaled back, although he still manages to doom the galaxy. The plot is a little better focused than Episode I, but it is still a cartoony mess of sensory overload and wooden acting delivering painfully cliche dialogue."
"May 05, 2016",2,"I had forgot what had I watch right after I walked out from cinema door. Unappealing story, underdevoloped characters, boring story perhaps, well, cause I really forgot what I had watch, and have no plan to watch it again."
"Apr 27, 2016",1.5,The worst of the saga. Attack of the clones really does not know what it wants to be. There really is no plot at some moments. Then to many at other moments. Though the cast is perfect for there roles and the special effects are top notch. The saga takes a big step backwards.

"Apr 17, 2016",2.5,"It is beyond me how Hayden Christensen made it through the casting. He delivers his lines like a robot / clone. There is ONE SCENE in the movie where something is coming out of his mouth ""naturally"" (the scene when the lightsaber breaks / he loses it and he says: ""Obi-Wan is going to kill me for this.""). Everything else sounds artificial.
It's not just how he says things, it's also WHAT he says. When your ""significant other to be"" says: ""I love democracy"", the correct answer if you want to get laid is not ""I love dictatorship."" And HOW your significant other falls in lover after this (and many other similar comments) is also beyond me.
Overall too much going on on the negative side to really enjoy this movie despite the visual spectacle..."

"Mar 23, 2016",1.5,"Attack of the Crap. As far Star Wars films go for me, Attack of the Clones is by far the worst of the Prequel Trilogy. The direction is lacking in so many areas, the acting is even worse than it was in The Phantom Menace, and Hayden Christensen's performance almost makes you wish JarJar was there to take his place; his performance is that bad for me.
This is a 'fresh' movie on Rotten Tomatoes, why? I have absolutely no idea at all. The cinematography is too sterile and 'clean' for a universe that is meant to be lived-in and established; this is a complete embarrassment to The Star Wars Saga.
In light of The Force Awakens restoring faith in the franchise for me and millions of other devote Star Wars fans, Episode II hit the absolute low point here. On the plus side though, it can't get any worse than this prequel.

Damn you Lucas, for making the word 'prequel' a Hollywood toxin, but thank you for giving the franchise to Disney, by saving it from yourself."
"Mar 21, 2016",3.5,"While yes, the Anakin/Padme love interest can be a little cheesy at times, the action sequences are great and the effects are superb. It also serves as great buildup in making Anakin a true tragic hero. I still don't believe it deserves all the hate it gets, but that's how I feel about all the prequel films."
"Mar 14, 2016",2,"Lacking the exciting action that would make it great and the undercooked characters that couldn't fill in the roles they were supposed to play, Star Wars: Episode II- Attack of the Clones is another disappointment from George Lucas."
"Mar 13, 2016",4,"Although Hayden Christiansen's acting is just terrible, this is still a pretty decent movie,"
"Mar 11, 2016",2,"Of the six Star Wars movies to have featured George Lucas in their conception, 'Attack of the Clones' is by far the weakest entry. While the first installment in the prequel series, 'The Phantom Menace' may have failed to live up to the excitement and sheer brilliance of the original trilogy, it still provided enough fantastical escapism and innocent joy to allow youngsters to become engaged in the Star Wars universe as their forefathers had back in 1977. With this follow-up, however, George Lucas has drifted so far from what made his creation so beloved in the first place, and descended into the realm of dreary soapiness, shallow romance and an inexplicable obsession with glossy special effects in place of good storytelling, rendering 'Attack of the Clones' a tedious experience at best, and to date, remains the only Star Wars movie I make a habit of avoiding. 

If Star Wars were a television series, this would be the show that everyone would warn you about: ""Episodes I and III are okay, but be wary of the one where the blonde kid blabbers on about sand"" is what they'd most likely tell you. The truth is, 'Attack of the Clones' isn't as bad as it is boring, and the plodding contents of the movie actually match its equally uninspired title. Despite the disappointment of 'The Phantom Menace', Episode II was a second chance for George Lucas. With the re-introduction now completed and paid for, 'Clones' was the installment that should have made the effort to really steer the Star Wars ship back on course, but instead, Lucas drifted it further out to sea. Rather than reignite the franchise in a way that Episode I failed to, Episode II dowses the flame. 

Unlike my review of 'The Phantom Menace', in which I was relatively forgiving towards the picture due to its impossible task of living up to the original movies, I feel less apologetic towards this second installment (or fifth, technically speaking.) Set approximately a decade or so after the events of the last movie, the plot of 'Attack of the Clones' centers on an assassination plot against Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), former Queen of Naboo now reduced to the role of a mundane senator, for reasons that are never really divulged. Jake Lloyd, who portrayed the ten-year-old Anakin Skywalker in the previous episode, has transformed into the slightly older and handsomer Hayden Christensen, but beyond his pleasant appearance and more advanced age, Anakin remains every inch the mopey sap he was the last time around; what a catastrophic error of judgment. At its heart, this entire trilogy is Anakin's story, and more specifically, his transformation into the dark lord of the Sith, Darth Vader. The trouble is, there is not one single aspect of Anakin's personality that can be deemed even remotely attractive or relatable in any way. While it would be a cheap shot to criticise Hayden's less-than-stellar performance, his underwhelming acting skills strike me less as a product of inexperience, and more likely the result of poor dialogue and Lucas's blatantly incompetent directorial skills. In spite of what George Lucas may have us believe, Anakin's internal frustrations are not compelling, at least not in the way they've been handled here. We all know who Anakin ultimately becomes, and his struggle between the light and the dark should be fascinating to watch as it gradually unfolds and continues to haunt the young Jedi Padawan. The trouble is, rather than come across as a volatile young man struggling with his inner demons like a Jekyll and Hyde type of character, Anakin is more like a whiney teenager rebelling against his parents (or in this instance, mentor) for not letting him stay out late. When his constant complaining and creepy lusting after Padme isn't getting on my nerves, his childish temper tantrums are making me cringe. Are we really expected to believe that this boy is going to evolve into one of cinema's greatest villains? Right now, I'm having trouble suspending my disbelief, no matter how young and naïve the would-be Vader is at this early stage. 

As events continue to unfold, we're subjugated to one of the most meticulously plotted romances to ever pester our screens, as Anakin's lust for Padme blossoms into a fully formed romance. The trouble is, much like the overused special effects, the Anakin/Padme romance is a distractingly superficial one. The movie constantly informs us that these two are in love, but at no point is there any hint of genuine chemistry between them. My thoughts turn back to the considerably more exciting romance shared between Han Solo and Princess Leia in 'The Empire Strikes Back', a relationship that began life as a unique mix of teasing and flirting, that gradually evolved into a love story. What's more, in spite of their differences, Han and Leia always made sense as a couple. Their personalities clashed regularly, but at least they actually had personalities. These cardboard cutouts we're left with in 'Attack of the Clones' show know signs of individuality. Neither Hayden Christensen or Natalie Portman appear to posses the acting talents required to bring this sterile script to life, and by the time their love finally reaches its fruition, I'm left cold. No matter how many beautifully constructed waterfalls or lush green fields ILM creates, nothing can constitute a replacement for legitimate emotional investment, which is what's really lacking here. 

The rather tedious love affair aside, what are we actually left with here? 'The Phantom Menace' at least possessed a sense of wonder, and although it was often shallow, I won't deny my enjoyment at witnessing the pod race sequence or the climactic final battle between our two Jedi leads and the enigmatic Darth Maul. There was a sense of rediscovery in Episode I that's desperately missing here. Rather than take the screen by force, the plot just sort of plods along, as though George Lucas hashed out a first draft in an evening and decided to start shooting the next day. As a special effects experiment, 'Attack of the Clones' is certainly impressive, but there's also a weightlessness to everything that occurs onscreen. The by-and-large absence of practical effects means that the universe ILM have created feels too much like fluid, completely intangible, and it's difficult to suspend any disbelief when I'm very aware that what I' watching has been generated on a computer. Ideally, the movie should have utilized a mature blend of practical and digital effects, but Lucas seemed far more interested in pushing the technical wizardry further than was necessary. 

Equally distracting are the blatant rip-offs of Ridley Scott. I know they say 'steal from the best', but I suspect Lucas took this advice a tad bit literally. With 'Gladiator' released just a year after 'The Phantom Menace', it's blindingly obvious that Mr. Lucas took 'inspiration' from the coliseum sequences and decided to incorporate them into his own works. That's all well and good, but when 'Blade Runner' is also incorporated in the narrative in a similarly unsubtle way, things start to look a bit suspicious. What's more, these said action sequences lack both the grit and the excitement of the aforementioned films, and harking back to my previous point regarding the intangibility of the visuals, its impossible to become invested in action sequences when they bare less resemblance to the power of cinema, and seem more akin to extended videogame cutscenes. When the clones do finally attack- which, ironically enough, doesn't even occur until the movie's third act- the screen is utterly void of tension. The Clones Wars have been teased ever since the original 1977 picture, with Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi discussing the mysterious period in excited hushed tones, and now we're finally witnessing them for the first time, only to be left cold by a bland struggle between digitally rendered clones and digitally rendered robots. More concerning, the climactic battle on the hive world of Geonosis is only the first battle of the Clone Wars, and with just one more installment remaining in the trilogy, it seems like a miscalculation to introduce the actual war so late in the game- bearing in mind, the franchise's name is Star Wars, not Star Senate Disputes. There's always the alternative of watching the 'Clone Wars' animated series, but ideally these movies should have focused more heavily on the wars themselves and less about their origins. 

I could discuss Christopher Lee's criminally underwritten role as the movie's new antagonist, Count Dooku, the 'insert here' replacement for Darth Maul, or Ewan McGregor's mildly decent imitation of Alec Guinness, but it all seems so inconsequential when considering that the movie failed to grab me in the first place. My inability to invest is what ultimately ruined the picture for me, and if you're audience doesn't care about the characters, then they're even less likely to care about the events transpiring onscreen. 'Attack of the Clones' amounts to little more than a visual effects experiment, with George Lucas's rushed script and lazy directing adding up to nothing more than an excuse for ILM to work their wonders. I'm not against experimentation, but can't escape the notion that it feels irresponsible to do so in a franchise as renowned and beloved as this. I appreciated the visual effects in Episode I, but by Episode II it all starts to feel a little overwhelming, and without a decent narrative thread running throughout this series worthy of investment, I feel hard-pressed to recommend 'Attack of the Clones' to anyone outside the Star Wars fandom. Watch for the purpose of completion, but ultimately, this is a very hollow and underwhelming affair at best, and nothing more than a necessary step closer to 'Revenge of the Sith.'"
"Mar 10, 2016",1.5,The biggest flaw with this film is that it doesn't feel like Star Wars in the slightest. A poorly written love story and teen angst leads a film which is a step back from what should have been a major step forward following The Phantom Menace.

"Jan 30, 2016",3,Mucho mejor que la anterior. Attack of the Clones muestra una increíble batalla entre los Jedi y los Sith.
"Jan 29, 2016",3,"In ""Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones"" (2002), a grown-up Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is charged with protecting Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) from some mysterious person who wants to kill her. Meanwhile, the Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is on a mission to find out, among other things, the purpose of the creation of a strange new army of genetically identical clones. A third plotline concerns Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and his increasing consolidation of power in the Galactic Senate under his supreme command. Much of this latter plotline parallels the fascist rise to power in Germany and Italy, and serves as a cautionary tale for our own time.

The movie does a lot in the way of fan service, but which will be fascinating to viewers if they have no familiarity with the series. For instance, fans of the original trilogy were likely long interested in seeing what kind of fighter the short green Henson-creation Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) was, and they get to see his frenetic style for the first time in this film. Even a newcomer to the series will delight.

The Star Wars franchise is and always has been space opera, so the amount of vitriol this film and the other prequel trilogy have received seems disproportionate in retrospect. ""Attack of the Clones"" is a fun, fast-paced popcorn Sci-Fi / Adventure movie. No doubt some of the criticisms are justified. Hayden Christensen DOES give a wooden performance, and some of the CGI in the film didn't even look good at the time. So it goes."
"Jan 27, 2016",5,Star Wars 2 was good it got down to fighting and there where Funny parts in that movie and good fights. You will see that Aniken Skywalker was a good fighter and same with Obie one they are 2 good fighters so I would see this movie if you are a Star Wars fan. The music was good.  This movie has funny parts with Anakin and Obi-Wan  Being so sarcastic to each other. And Count Dooku was funny and sarcastic he made me laugh a lot! The battles with the light sabers where great to see! So much more to this movie was great!! See the battle good Vs evil and it will blow you away! Pick your side of the Light side or the Dark side

"Jan 26, 2016",2,"Star Wars Attack of The Clones, does a little bit better than the Phantom Menace, but it's still a disappointing movie, even though it gets better at the End with the introduction to the Republic Clone Army, and a new villain called Count Douku, also know as Lord Tarnus, played by the late Sir Christopher Lee, it does a better job keeping you in it at the end, a little at the beginning, some what in the middle of the movie. But it gets better in the next movie."
"Jan 25, 2016",1,Terribly written and horribly acted only some enjoyment is found within the third act 
"Jan 23, 2016",3.5,Attack of the Clones is pretty good! It's not as bad as The Phantom Menace but it's not as good as Revenge of the Sith and Return of the Jedi. I cried when Anakin's mother died in his arms. The battle in the pit thing has always been my favorite scene. And Yoda is always going to be my fave!
"Jan 21, 2016",0.5,"The worst of the three, dull characterization, a mind blowing plot that is only mind blowing because of how the characters act unaware of the evil work that the villains are so clearly behind you must think the jedi have never known the meaning gullible, as for the forced love story u feel is not real but that we are forced to be told they are in love in horrendous dialogue, as well as emotionless fights between clones and robots that the audience feels no connection to, everyone feels like an alien, I can't relate to any character as a human being besides Ewan McGregor s charm which was much improved from the phantom menace, but too many shoe horned characters that did not need to be told such as a specific bounty hunter, and the huge ripping off of homage from empire strikes back yet failed to capture the magic and depth of characters, and the emotion of the scenes, clone wars is one of the worst block buster films I have ever scene in my life. if u are a romance lover you will not enjoy the forced and terrible love subplot in the mess."
"Jan 19, 2016",0.5,I thought this was fan-fiction. lol
"Jan 18, 2016",5,Another amazing film loved the clone battles
"Jan 17, 2016",1,"Slightly more interesting than the last entry, but still infuriatingly slow and visually overpopulated. "
"Jan 15, 2016",2.5,"There is no lack of vision in this one, yet it leaves something to be desired - maybe about twenty minutes less and a more neatly compressed third act. The opening scenes include a lot of action on Corsucant that showcases an older and more dangerous Anakin Skywalker as he is trained by an increasingly skeptical Obi-wan Kenobi. While Star Wars is known as being a visionary trend setter, I couldn't help but acknowledge that we have seen better futuristic city traffic in The Sixth Sense, and vastly better futuristic advertising in Blade Runner and Verhoven's Total Recall.

Attack of the Clones also features the budding romance of Anakin and now Senator Amidala - awful. It's not just that the acting and script are not great, they are actually bad at parts. The superior performances go to Ewan McGreggor, Samuel Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Yoda. In fact, McGregor, Jackson, and Lee have better chemistry with completely animated characters than the two actual human actors who are supposed to be falling in love do.

The last, and worst flaw of the otherwise entertaining film is that it not only looked like it was made to be a video game, but it actually moved like a video game in more gratuitous ways than the pod racer scenes of Episode 1. THe most gratuitous example of this was when Amidala was timing her leaps and bounds to avoid obstacles on a droid assembly line convert belt. I almost felt like I was holding a dual shock in my hands, and by the time all hell broke loose in the insect-like alien arena, I found myself wondering why somebody just didn't enter the Konami code and get it over with.

Other than the city scenes in the opening act, there were some other really great parts of Attack of the Clones. The scene where Obi-wan found himself in a mysterious floating civilization that happened to be producing a clone army was not only visually interesting, it was almost just plain interesting. The character Django Fett was a well designed villain who provided backstory to the popular Boba Fett from the first series. The political sequences in the movie worked, and were minimal, but moved the story along without taking too much away from the action. Anakin's first step toward the dark side were well illustrated, and the light saber fighting was for the most part excellent, including the long-awaited debut of Yoda's light saber skills.

With all of the good scenes and visuals in Attack of the Clones, it's a shame that it wasn't put together with a little more pace and purpose. It's still rewatchable, but I did find myself zoning out a bit during the thickest chunks of clunky dialogue."
"Jan 15, 2016",2,This film is really boring until the end. It has a love story worse than Twilights and ruins Yoda in my opinion
"Jan 15, 2016",1.5,Attack of the Clones is just plain bad.Hayden what have you done.
"Jan 15, 2016",2.5,Better than The Phantom Menace at least.
"Jan 12, 2016",2.5,"Filled to the brim with tiresome exposition, incredibly wooden dialogue, and a story that strongly lacks any semblance of fun, apart from the imagination and visuals presented, Attack of the Clones is (as hard as it is to say) a pretty hard one to sit through."
"Jan 11, 2016",3,"The biggest disappointment with Attack of the Clones is that, while it addresses many of the issues with The Phantom Menace, it adds its own issues to the mix. Like the previous film, it has many great moments--the chance to revisit the Tatooine homestead is nostalgic bliss, while the water-world of Kamino is unsettling in the best possible way--but the whole is less than the sum of its parts."
"Jan 10, 2016",2.5,"the relation between Anakin and Padmia is so forced and you just don't believe it. Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan  is the best thing in the movie. Hate Yoda with a lightsaber, the love dialog is forced, and the title makes no since. It should have been called Star Wars Shrowd of the Dark Side. Still better than Phantom."
"Jan 10, 2016",2.5,"With bad acting, bad dialogue, and a lot of CGI that makes the film look like a video game, Attack Of The Clones is sadly, the worst Star Wars film in the series."
"Jan 09, 2016",2.5,The force in this movie is with Obi Wan but not with Skywalker...with this performance it was just a question of time until he stepped over to the dark side....of acting
"Jan 08, 2016",0.5,So you want to watch a movie so unbearably bad and cringe full that it scars you forever? Watch this.
"Jan 07, 2016",2.5,"With non-stop action detracting somewhat from the paper doll characters and plodding backstory, Attack of the Clones one-ups its predecessor...but not by much. All of the criticism aimed at The Phantom Menace pretty much holds up here for this even busier sequel where - again - very little happens. For all of the frenetic action, you'd think that something must be happening (the original trilogy name-checked The Clone Wars numerous times), but it's all just plasticine window dressing for what amounts to someone else's video game adventure played out on the big screen. As an example, there's one scene where our (anti) hero rides a completely CG-rendered cow-like creature and falls off for comic effect. What's more distressing than the fact that it's not at all funny is the animal's lazy design. With laser-sharp study skills, Disney animators observe the movement and mannerisms of an influence before designing, drawing, and animating a new species. What, George Lucas and Company couldn't watch video of a bull ride before putting pixel to digital paper? The horror show that results looks awkward and just plain uninspired which pretty much sums up the entire viewing experience of Attack of the Clones. 

In this PG-rated sci-fi adventure set ten years after initially meeting, Anakin Skywalker shares a forbidden romance with Padmé, while Obi-Wan investigates an assassination attempt on the Senator and discovers a secret clone army crafted for the Jedi. 

Seeing (now) Oscar winner Natalie Portman try to work her skills around insipid dialogue and a wooden co-star in Hayden Christensen proves painful, but the digital effects are every bit as soulless as the acting. The only one who gets it is McGregor, who runs in cadence with this chapter's runaway carnival ride feel, needless exposition thankfully falling behind the smoke and mirrors of mindless thrills.  

Bottom line: Attack the Blockheads"
"Jan 07, 2016",2.5,"The weakest part of the prequels, I think. It's jus poor, even though some action scenes are truly fun to watch like that of a fight between Joda and the villain."
"Jan 06, 2016",3.5,"Star Wars Attack of the clones is a better movie than The Phantom Menace in my opinion.  Attack of the clones has more action and a bit more excitement.  The visuals are good again, The music is great as it always is and the lightsaber duels are well done. There is hardly any Jar Jar Binks and Ewen Mcgregor and Ian Mcdiarmid are great in their performances.  And then we get to the bad points again.

1) The dialogue in some scenes is cringeworthy and isn't good, especially the love scenes with Anakin and Padme.
2) Boba Fett shouldn't of been put in the movie at all, Jango Fett was fine but he could of mentioned he had a son or not at all.  It kind of ruined the mystery of Boba Fett.
3) The love story between Anakin and Padme was cringeworthy and could of been done a lot better.  Some of the things Anakin says to Padme, you wouldn't say to a girl in real life, it would just scare her off like.
4) Some of the scenes shouldn't of been In the movie, like when Obi-Wan goes to that diner and is asking that chef about the poison dart and Kamino.

I thought Hayden playing as Anakin, he did ok, he did the best he could of done with the dialogue and everything he was given.  I think his best moments is when he says nothing and stares or looks annoyed, he pulls off a good angry face.  I also liked in some scenes where you can kind of see his beginning on the path to the dark side.  You can see his anger, his frustration, he has a hard time of letting go of things, he's a risk taker, he's impatient.  It's all the things that lead down that dark path, I thought that was ok to be honest.  

Attack of the clones is a good movie, if you can tune out from the love scenes and ignore some of the dialogue."
"Jan 05, 2016",2,Worst Star Wars film.
"Jan 05, 2016",3.5,"Better than The Phantom Menace. I wish the deleted scenes would have been added to this film. It would lengthen it by about 15 minutes but would help the film overall.

Rating: B-"
"Jan 04, 2016",0.5,"Disgusting, NO STARS!!!"
"Jan 04, 2016",5,"Clones, lightsabers, droids, bounty hunter v jedi fights, Yoda in action! This movie will blow you away!"
"Jan 03, 2016",2.5,"The story is dull, the acting is wooden, and worst of all, no chemistry is felt between Anakin and Obi Wan. Instead of letting a romance naturally flow out of a great story, Lucas forcefeeds an awkward love story in what is the least-Star Warsy Star Wars film in the entire saga."
"Jan 03, 2016",0.5,"So much has already been said about this movie's wooden acting, over-reliance on CGI, and flat characterization, but there are a few specific problems that I have always bothered me about this film. 
The first huge problem is the casting. While it might be easy to blame Hayden Christensen for ruining the movie, he has the exact same whining delivery that he did in Life as a House a year earlier. Just like Jake Lloyd, Hayden has been blamed for what is essentially a lethal combination of bad writing and horrible casting. Oddly Natalie Portman, who gives an equally flat performance with equally nauseating dialogue, has avoided the criticism directed at Christensen. 
Many people have criticized awful lines like the infamous ""I hate sand"" monologue. However, I think these scenes could have been (partially) saved by simply removing the dialogue altogether. So much of the sexual tension between Han and Leia in Empire was created with minimal dialogue. In the prequels every emotion, every motivation, every thought is awkwardly explained in a completely emotionally vacant fashion. Instead of allowing the audience to live through anger, romance, friendship, suspicion, the filmmakers tell the audience what emotions are at play. Notice how many times the characters say, ""I feel..."" This lack of emotional sophistication is a major factor in the failure of the prequels. 
While Jar Jar's role is thankfully stunted, C-3PO is given an extended, childish sequence that feels forced. If you watch the original trilogy there are no moments that even closely resemble this lowest common denominator slapstick. C3PO, who doesn't belong in the prequels anyway, has always been the comic relief, but his humor has always been directly related to the action of the plot. Even at his dumbest in ROTJ, C3PO is still driving the story along. He is necessary for the scenes with Jabba. He is an important part of the agreement with the Ewoks. In Attack of the Clones, he can literally be removed from the entire movie and it would make no difference. 
This leads me to my next big problem: terrible villains. Christopher Lee is an amazing actor and usually a fun villain. However, he is given nothing to work with in this movie. At first it looks like George is playing with some ambiguity regarding Count Dooku: Is he a bad guy or just a Separatist? Why did he leave the Jedi? Are they mad at him for leaving? Is he mad at the Jedi? But instead of creating a dynamic, layered character, they simply make Count Dooku a standard bad guy with no special power, motivation, or even clothing. When it comes to the big fight at the end, there is nothing at stake. He shoots lightning. He has a red lightsaber. 
Which leads me to my next issue...Yoda and his lightsaber. I am definitely not the first person to express dismay at Yoda, whose lack of physical prowess is exactly what makes him a dynamic character, is reduced to flipping around like a ninja. This would have been a great opportunity to showcase some new Jedi powers that we had never seen before. They could have demonstrated that Yoda is beyond using weapons and merely needs the Force as his ally. But alas, they created a video game. 
I could say more about the illogical speeder chase, the misguided use of Samuel L. Jackson as the serene Mace Windu, Naboo's utterly confusing democratic monarchy (they elect teenage queens?), Jimmy Smitts and his British accent, and so much more. 
These issues, however, only address pieces of a larger problem. From the flat dialogue to the sterile CGI environments, this film has no heart and soul. Moments like Luke looking silently at the two suns of Tatooine or Han bickering with Leia in the asteroid belt or Chewie yelling at Vader when he's revealed in Cloud City, these are the moments that we connect with as an audience.
I must admit, however, that there are a few positives. Ian McDiarmid proves once again that he is the only person capable of uttering George Lucas' dialogue, and the rainy ocean planet was an interesting location. But these minor pluses cannot outweigh the enormous negatives. 
In the end, it's only a movie, but it's also a lost opportunity."
"Jan 02, 2016",4,"Good movie, but there's a few flaws that stand out.  Practical effects always adds realism, and filling in just a couple plot holes.  Hayden Christensen did a great job for what he was given.  I won't hold any of his somewhat ""cheesy acting"" scenes against him.  Actors follow what the film maker wants.  So its not his fault that the film maker didn't focus on giving him more drama lessons.  Oh, and if it were up to me, I would have given the role of Count Dooku to Frank Langella"
"Jan 02, 2016",2.5,"The second movie of the prequel trilogy is better than the first...but still leaves some to be desired. With ridiculous characters moved to the backdrop and even better action sequences, this is another fun sci-fi adventure that reveals even more about the Star Wars universe. However, it goes wrong by delving into boring political subplots and diverges from the epic drama that makes Star Wars so great. The beginning of Anakin's departure from the Jedi is also boring, with just a couple effective moments thrown in, but overall leaves episode 3 with a lot of holes to fill in. Another solid entry, but don't expect to fall in love with it."
"Jan 01, 2016",4,"Great movie and great addition to the Star Wars saga. It has a major focus on the events that happened in Anakin's life that pushed him towards joining the dark side in episode 3. This movie made it easier for me to understand and empathize Anakin and his transformation to Darth Vadar. But I found that some dialogue was poorly written and some scenes unnecessary and poorly done. This movie could have been done better, but did a good job showing the beginning of the darker side of Anakin."
"Jan 01, 2016",0.5,Star Wars II: Attack of the Terrible CGI
"Jan 01, 2016",2,This movie is BORING.  Noting happens for like 2/3 of the movie and it also contains the worse love story in movie history.  Every time Anakin was onscreen I was either checking out or laughing at his acting.  The last 3rd isn't much better because it turns into a video game you're watching someone else play.  Bad guy sucked and the last fight sucked.  How did we go from Darth Maul to some old dude?  Jango was cool.  I'll give them that.
"Dec 31, 2015",0.5,"I hate this movie. It's painful to watch. It commits the worst sin a movie can: being boring. There's not much else, just uncomfortable dialogue, silly over choreographed ""action"" scenes, and in a feat of almost impossible stupidity the moron George Lucas has made a confusing, over complicated plot actually pointless, boring, and amount to absolutely nothing. Good on George Lucas, you subhuman piece of self admiring garbage ."
"Dec 31, 2015",3,"Better in Some Ways, Worse in Others

Originally Written May 16, 2002--
Set ten years after the events of ""The Phantom Menace,"" the Republic continues to be mired in strife and chaos. A separatist movement encompassing hundreds of planets and powerful corporate alliances poses new threats to the galaxy that even the Jedi cannot stem. These moves, long planned by an as yet unrevealed and powerful force, lead to the beginning of the Clone Wars -- and the beginning of the end of the Republic. In the middle of all this chaos, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect Sen. Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman).

I really wanted to like this new Star Wars adventure. After the disappointment that was ""The Phantom Menace,"" I truly hoped this one would be a lot better. I'm happy to report that it is better in some ways, but frustrated to report that it's worse in others. While George Lucas has expanded his storytelling capabilities with amazing CGI advances in the last ten years, what suffers the most here is how wooden the acting is, how awful the dialogue is, and when there's no CGI candy to spice up the screen, how painful it is to watch. We all know that Anakin and Padme are destined to become the parents of a pair of twins named Luke and Leia, but there is exactly zero chemistry between Christensen and Portman. Luckily, the best part of the film occurs in the last 45 minutes when we get to watch the beginning of the long promised Clone Wars begin. And when yes, a certain diminutive Jedi FINALLY gets to show off his stuff! Three stars out of five."
"Dec 31, 2015",4.5,excelente pelicula.. Anakis se esta acercando al DarkSide
"Dec 31, 2015",2,It's my least favorite Star Wars movie because of Anikan and Padme in love. Their love just doesn't function.  But the big arena fight was pretty cool.
"Dec 30, 2015",2.5,better than the first part
"Dec 30, 2015",3,"Attack of the Clones features a poor performance by Hayden Christensen playing the main character Anakin, an occasionally bad writing and it definitely is the corniest Star Wars movie. However, I still like this film. I like the story and the action is superb. I also like some of the characters here like Yoda, Mace Windu etc. and, yes, I like Padme (mostly because of her looks, though). I think that Dooku is a more interesting character than Darth Maul, because he has a better character development, even though it is slightly lacking. Also, the Bounty Hunter lacks character development. So, i'm definitely not a fan of this movie, but it's better and improved from it's predecessor."
"Dec 30, 2015",3,"For its story, Attack of the Clones is surprisingly slow, but has some stellar setpieces. Even more than the first movie, Episode II is hampered by its enormous reliance on CGI. Not having a single clone be a real person in a suit is really tough and dates it immediately. At that point the movie is practically half-animated."
"Dec 29, 2015",4.5,Really liked the back drop to it even though not a big d SyFy person.
"Dec 29, 2015",2.5,"Chaos.  There are just too many things going on in this movie, when the two things that should have been focused on were the love story of Anakin &amp; Padme and the clone wars.  There are always some action sequences that redeem the movie overall, like the bounty hunter chases on Coruscant and Kamino.  The arena battle is unnecessary to the story."
"Dec 29, 2015",2.5,"In my opinion Attack Of The Clones is the worst movie in the Star Wars saga. It has worse acting and CGI than The Phantom Menace, the plot about the secret clone army that is being built for the republic is pretty stupid, like seriously how do you not know about an army being made for you. There were also a bunch of side plots in the movie that were irrelevant to the main plot. The love story is cringe worthy and Hayden Christensen is so bad in this movie it's unbelievable. Attack Of The Clones has some upsides like the arena battle scene or the scene where Obi-Wan and Anakin are chasing a bounty hunter through the city but besides that there isn't much to like about this movie."
"Dec 29, 2015",1,hands down the worst star wars movie
"Dec 28, 2015",2,"Too many boring, dull talking scenes. The lore is explored in cool ways but it still is just talking and often contradicts itself. If I had a top 10 list for my favorite Star Wars movie moments, I'd have one for every movie, except for Attack of the Clones. Even the lightsaber fight is underwhelming. Yoda flipping around was just stupid and out of character."
"Dec 28, 2015",2,"Predictable, and irritating, the wars continue drudgingly. You often wonder what prompted Lucas to make this trilogy and then to make it badly. Is it a phenomenon common with commercially successful directors - once you make something that is purely commercial yet good, you have no idea how to follow it up so you go formulaic and destroy it all? Aside: the romantic angle was so devoid of emotion and bereft of art, that it left a bad taste in the mouth. The beauty of 4,5,6 was that the romantic angle was downplayed and fun. Here, it was worse than commercial Bollywood."
"Dec 28, 2015",3.5,"Christensen's acting makes this such a hard watch. Even McGregor wasn't great but I think his performance was at least believable. It was exciting to see the clones knowing what would become. For me, the prequels fulfil my need for more Yoda and more lightsabers so to be honest, that fills that quota. Still an entertaining watch but nothing ground-breaking happens like in the next episode. Except maybe we accept that Anakin's a little shit that doesn't do as he's told!"
"Dec 28, 2015",2.5,"George Lucas continúa hundiendo la excelente trilogía de ""Star Wars"" con esta confusa y reforzada segunda entrega de precuelas, con actuaciones de lo peor y con unas batallas que son tan rápidas que no se pueden apreciar si usted parpadea.  ""Attack Of The Clones"" se define con 3 palabras: aburrida, aburrida y aburrida.  ¡Y ni hablar de los diálogos de pacotilla!"
"Dec 28, 2015",3.5,A better love story is starting to develop even if Anakin is totally unlikeable and Ewan McGregor saves it all.
"Dec 27, 2015",2.5,"Even as a child, this installment of the Star Wars saga never stuck out to me as much. Perhaps it was its sporadic dragging throughout the film, or its hammy romantic subplot. Nonetheless, Attack of the Clones is more bearable than its predecessor thanks to some a cast that seems more interested in the material, and some admittedly solid action sequences (though the CGI overabundance hurts it to a degree). Verdict: C+"
"Dec 27, 2015",1,Horrible Acting.  Horrible Writing.  Horrible Directing.  Horrible choreography. It felt like Lucas just didn't care about giving a good product for this one.  The only good thing was the special effects.  Maybe that's where all the resources went.
"Dec 27, 2015",2.5,"Slightly better, but no great improvement."
"Dec 27, 2015",4,Underrated Star Wars movie
"Dec 27, 2015",2.5,"Slightly better than the previous episode, but still full of horrible acting and bad dialogue. R2D2 and C-3PO are the best ones in the film and that isn't saying much."
"Dec 27, 2015",4,"On my second watch after a decade the movie felt even better than the first time round although it's not as good as episode 1. The visuals are a treat to watch, the story-line a mixed blessing, while the overall plot is intriguing and interesting, it's overshadowed by the love angle and the stupid adventures of the Jedi knights. The advisory to the Jedi's plays a central part in the franchise and this time he didn't feel as villainous or sinister as the previous ones. Hayden Christensen as Anikin Skywalker is a mix blessing, there are moments when his performance looks like a bad act of a lecher or a hot head and other times we can see the birth of Darth Vadar in his expression. Still a Star Wars movie is a fun entertainer."
"Dec 26, 2015",1,"I hate sand, it's coarse and it gets everywhere."
"Dec 26, 2015",1,"This film, in my opinion, is worse than the Phantom Menace. This is mainly due to over-the-top and unnecessary CGI, a poor performance by Hayden Christensen and a plot that fails to take off until 2 hours into the film itself. The only benefiting scenes in this movie are the ""Jedi vs Droids"" battle and the ""Yoda vs Dooku"" fight scene. The music by John Williams is still perfect, but it is all wasted on a poor spectacle that desperately tries to be good. And, to top it off, the script for Anakin and Padme's love story is more than horrible."
"Dec 26, 2015",2,"Probably the filler movie in the prequals, not much happens as its mostly fluff and chitter chat. Anakin is portrayed as a whiny little boy, its frustrating to watch but crucial in the story as Darth Vaders story develops. By far the worst in the whole Star Wars franchise."
"Dec 26, 2015",3,"A considerable improvement from Episode I, Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones is visually dazzling, but suffers from some cliched dialogue especially around Anakin and Padme's love story."
"Dec 25, 2015",2,"Attack of The Clones suffers from undeveloped characters, bland acting, love scenes that make you want to gag because of how bad the dialog is, and a dull sterile environment plagued by CGI elements in places where there really doesn't need to be."
"Dec 25, 2015",0.5,"Phantom Menace has in many ways fallen into modern parlance to mean all that is terrible in the world, somehow this absolutely steaming turd of a movie seems to have escaped the same punishment.  It's almost like the critics couldn't quite believe that this is in fact worse.  It's so dull...I mean mind-numbingly so, there is nothing at all here to keep you entertained or otherwise engaged.  So, so much worse than I remembered."
"Dec 25, 2015",4.5,"Probably the least in the Star Wars universe, yet it gives important insight to Darth Vaders rise!"
"Dec 24, 2015",2.5,"Rating: 54%
With an unnecessary romance subplot, less entertaining action, and shoddier work on the script and visuals, Attack of the Clones is obviously the most disappointing out of all the films in the franchise."
"Dec 24, 2015",2.5,Still cheesy but not as bad as Episode I. The action helps. Horrible acting still by Natalie Portman &amp; Hayden Christensen.
"Dec 24, 2015",1,Worst movie in the franchise.   Hayden Christiansan can't act.   The romance was unbelievable and forced.  New lore concerning the Jedi sucked ass making them anti-love bad guys.
"Dec 23, 2015",4,Criminally underrated.
"Dec 23, 2015",3,Its definitely the worst of the star wars movies. The ending was the best part. they wasted tons of great characters to set off for the last movie. still something you can sit through though
"Dec 22, 2015",4,Again an improvement from the Phantom Menace. Really really nice graphics. Had a very slow start. But after that the last 45 minutes was a really epic battle. The fight scene between count Dooku and Yoda is really awesome and it sets up the death Star which is really cool. Overall pretty good movie could be better though.
"Dec 22, 2015",1.5,"Ugh. Couldn't wait for this one to end -- a total mess. So much CGI, so little character development (other than Anakin embracing hate -- but c'mon, if your someone messed with your mama, you get what you deserve! And the sappy little love affair with the Senator does not count !! It was nauseatingly saccharine -- i felt like i was watching a young teen drama instead of SW! ) and even Yoda coming to Obi-Wan and Anakin's rescue in Geonisis was a joke. Whatever happened to the simple storyline of Ep. 4/5/6 ?"
"Dec 22, 2015",4,Better than Phantom Menace... but the love scenes were drawn out and overdone.  The rest was ok.
"Dec 22, 2015",1.5,"If you thought the Phantom Menace was bad, then just wait till you see Attack of the Clones (its even worse). Have fun trying to watch George Lucas tell an absolutely terrible love story that is just cringe worthy every second. If I can give something positive. I guess Jango Fett is cool, but there is not much else to say."
"Dec 21, 2015",4.5,"Gotta say, I think Episode 2 is a lot better than people give it credit for.  For whatever reason, people hated Hayden Christensen playing Anakin Skywalker.  I, on the other hand, think he did a fantastic job (in this and ep. 3) showing the emergence of The Dark Side.  He shows those emotions quite well.  This installment has a really cool war sequence where we get to see all the Jedi's fight, even Samuel L Jackson.  Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, for being so old, does a wonderful job holding his own against his younger counterparts.  And we get to see badass Yoda do a bit of fighting.  There's a much better storyline than ep. 1, with better foreshadowing of what's to come."
"Dec 21, 2015",2.5,rom-com in a Galaxy far far away
"Dec 21, 2015",2,"There is a plethora of things that are wrong with Attack of The Clones.That make it,for me,the worst Star Wars movie of them all.

First off,it doesn´t look like a Star Wars movie.Whereas The Phantom Menace had some shots here and there that were very reminiscent of the original trilogy, in this one we get both a change of environments and settings,and an overload of cgi making up most of these environments and settings.This combination makes the entire movie,with few exceptions,seem like one long video cutscene from some futuristic sci-fi videogame.Were this the only issue of the movie you could see it as just a change in tone and focus for the prequel trilogy and maybe accept it as something different,but still Star Wars,but this is not the case and just adds insult to injury as the movie is not only terrible but it doesn´t fit into the Star Wars vision we all know and love.

A general problem with the movie (and the 3 prequels) is basically that the scripts are terrible,the dialogue is terrible,and the general story,while not bad,is told in such a poor way that it is difficult to salvage anything from the rubble.The poor characters and acting,the settings,the cgi abuse,the unnecesary flamboyance,the overall feel to the story,all these problems stem from bad writing.They were doomed from the start.

Hayden Christensen´s Anakin is the perfect example of this.I´m not saying he´s a good actor,but the guy was crippled from the start.The character is horribly written,with exaggerated outbursts of anger coming from nowhere,with awful dialogue expressing feelings that you never connect or relate to as Ewan McGregor´s solid Obi Wan never does or say anything to Anakin to really justify his rage.Then there´s the unbelievably awkward and forced relationship with Padme.As has been stated before,Anakin is very weird and creepy and stalkish during the whole thing,and his dialogue and acting is cringeworthy as are the scenes that build up this ""romance"".Not even Natalie Portman can save it, reduced to deliver one cheesy line after another.

Character-wise,aside from Obi-Wan,Chancellor Palpatine and Christopher Lee (perhaps the best redeeming factor of the movie) there are not many memorable ones here.Jango Fett is played great by the rough-looking actor,but this brings another problem to the table.Lucas insists on connecting everything from the original trilogy to the prequels,which is as understandable as it is absurd as they are,after all,prequels,set before the originals took place.The entire ""stormtroopers come from clones of Boba Fett´s father"" storyline is just a complex way to bring Boba Fett into the picture,and I don´t mean the actual Boba,but his father,which is basically Boba Fett in different colored armor.It´s ludicrous and comes from either listening too much to fans or just being childish and trying to put every cool aspect of the original trilogy into the prequels (see Death Star references).

Returning to the visual feel of the movie,and to punctuate with a striking aspect for me,I can honestly say that there is 1 (I´m sure there a few more,but I cannot recall) shot in the entire movie that looks like a ""Star Wars"" shot,visually and camera-wise.It is when Padme is in the hollow recipient in the droid factory, about to have molten metal poured inside it and onto her,and the camera zooms in on her face.It is amazing how far this movie goes into new visual territory, departing from the original trilogy and what the Phantom Menace held onto (not that it wasn´t that much).

It is another problem of the film and one central to the prequels;No restraint,no limits,no boundaries.George Lucas has always stated that these movies were Star Wars movies made as he truly envisioned them,products of a time when technology allowed him to fulfill his vision with no barriers.Alas,this has been his and their downfall.Early on in the movie we are treated to an orgy of CGI and special effects that are uncalled for,unnecessary,and instead of inmersing us in the film,detach us from it.For example Obi-Wan crashing out the window and grabbing onto the drone sent to assassinate Padme in her room.What follows is Obi hanging on and flying all across the city´s sky amidst air traffic,with Anakin following him in his vehicle,and actually throwing himself from it to fall onto another one in midair.It is quite flamboyant to say the least,and like the droid factory hijinks (including fight scenes that remind me of Minority Report´s equally unnecessary and flamboyant car assembly fight scenes) they just showcase how CGI has erased the limits once present in the original trilogy (and movies in general back then) that made such wondrous art possible through painstakingly creating,making tangible the stories in our heads,as opposed to shooting actors against a green screen and creating from scratch in a laptop.

I might have to rewatch this to think of other things that are wrong within it,but I think I have sufficiently stated my case as to why I believe Attack of The Clones to be the worst part in the Star Wars saga.Hell,even the music sucks."
"Dec 21, 2015",1,"Arguably the worst of the Star Wars saga, Attack of the Clones proves that George Lucas completely misses the point of the prequels and after the pointless and terrible Phantom Menace, this movie focuses on the romance between Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala more than anything else, instead of the friendship of Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi and the corruption and seduction of Anakin like how it was explained in the original Star Wars trilogy. The Clone Wars begin too late because of the pointlessness of The Phantom Menace, and misses the opportunity of improving Anakin and Obi-Wan's friendship so it can matter more in the next movie. The pointlessness of The Phantom Menace also forces the last film to begin at the end of the war which shows that the whole Clone Wars angle is a missed opportunity. It doesn't work as a Star Wars movie because of these.

Despite all this, it also doesn't work as a movie on its own either. The story is basically a horrible love story, and the parts that aren't part of the love story (which is the Clone Wars arc) is quite stupid.

The characters aren't interesting either. Our main character, Anakin, is a whiny, murderous, creepy stalker, and I hate him. His romance with Padmé is written horribly, and it's arguably the worst love story ever put on screen (yes, even worse than Twilight). Most of the other characters are boring stereotypes. The only good characters in this movie are Obi-Wan and Yoda.

Without a good story or characters to be invested in, all the amazing visual effects, thrilling action or another amazing soundtrack don't matter at all, which makes this movie another dull Star Wars movie. Try to avoid the official movie at all costs. Watch a fanedit of this instead."
"Dec 21, 2015",3.5,it's alright but it was a bit dramatic. it could use some more war scenes
"Dec 20, 2015",2,"I really don't at all find this better than ""The Phantom Menace"". Even though I had issues with ""The Phantom Menace"" for some big reasons, based on my opinion, I find this one to be the least of the Star Wars series.

The first thing that the movie suffers is how it gives out so many expositions. I don't believe that the film does an excellent job explaining the plot or the situations that's happening in the film, so that was a problem. But that's not my real problem. My real problem is the relationship between Anakin and Padme. I don't think it's sweet nor effective. I just think it's tedious and uninteresting. I don't find Hayden Christensen's performance as wooden as Jake Lloyd's performance in ""The Phantom Menace"", but he is close.

The film does deliver nice special effects and a lot of effort, so I'll give points for that. It's fine that people will say that this is better than ""The Phantom Menace"", but for me, I dislike this one a little more than ""The Phantom Menace"". 4.5/10"
"Dec 20, 2015",5,More action. Less whining.
"Dec 20, 2015",1.5,A technically superb bore.
"Dec 19, 2015",2,"I have no idea how Lucas managed to make a Star Wars movie boring, but he did. Attack of the Clones is the absolute worst prequel by far, due in large part to the horrendous writing and the mere existence of Hayden Christensen."
"Dec 19, 2015",3,"While not as bad as episode i, this film should have a rotten score."
"Dec 19, 2015",3.5,It's quite a decent adventure. I like the steady flow of action and moxy of Obi-One. The romance is not well done and adds to a slightly overlong runtime. It also needed better character development.
"Dec 19, 2015",0.5,Who paid the 66% of critics to write positive reviews about this rubbish?
"Dec 19, 2015",1.5,"easily the worst star wars movie, with its main problem being that anakin just comes off as whiny at times and creepy at others"
"Dec 19, 2015",2,only a little less garbage like than Episode I
"Dec 19, 2015",5,"I don't see how you can be a Star Wars fan and not like the prequels, maybe excluding Ep 1. In some ways I feel the prequels are more Star Warsy than the originals. It's Lucas's full vision, with all the worlds, a huge diversity in creatures everywhere; this is how the galaxy was back before the original trilogy. 

The whole time I feel for Anakin like ""No! Don't be so angry. Stay positive."" But he is on this downward spin and you can see it coming, and then this is contrasted with his love for Padme. People disparage Hayden Christensen but I think he's pretty good; you can see the turbulence on his face the whole time.

It's the origins of everything. You get to see Boba Fett as a child. You get to see Yoda's skill, and you understand why he's so respected. Anakin is extremely strong and he still gets his arm hacked off at the end-I forgot he lost lost his arm!-which of course harkens back to his son, who would lose his hand years later. There are layers to everything. Yoda is a main character, and dispenses wisdom the whole time. I appreciate the creativity of the world building, and Lucas expressing it fully. These are supposed to be different from the original trilogy because it's just about Anakin. It's about how he becomes the greatest villain. Darth Vader will always just be Anakin to me."
"Dec 19, 2015",1,"Easily the worst Star Wars ever made. Laughable dialogue, cringy love angel between Anakin and Padme, Lucas going overkill with CGI, etc. The action sequences are fun, like most Star Wars movies, but that won't excuse how poor this film is."
"Dec 19, 2015",3.5,This movie has a great story and some decent action scenes but some of the dialogue is horrible and it looks like your watching a cartoon at times with all the visual effect.
"Dec 18, 2015",3,"Once again, at least an hour of this prequel is tedious and seems unncessary, however it does begin better than the first. It quickly loses that upperhand by introducing useless villains, repetitive action scenes, and so much CGI I thought I was watching a cartoon at once. Anakin is an insufferable lead and it's extremely hard to buy the quick and unrealistic love story that comes from himself and Padme. However, there are some scenes that make it worthwhile, and once again the effects and creatures and insanely cool. This movie benefits from world building and showing us more than the later installments do."
"Dec 18, 2015",3,"The story is interesting enough, but the dialogue is noticeably weak in this episode, and to most seems laughable when said aloud. The effects are again impressive though, and we are beginning to piece things together in our way back to the originals. More of the darker stuff is what we need."
"Dec 18, 2015",4,"Peg it on the Star Wars Nerdism(?) in me, but I just can't help myself."
"Dec 18, 2015",1.5,"A marginal improvement over the previous disaster in the saga, but Attack of the Clones is still plagued with shockingly awful acting, hollow characters, horribly offensive racial stereotypes and an overwhelming, headache-inducing amount of sub-par visual effects. It benefits from a single plotline that seems to actually have even a smidgen of relevance in the Star Wars saga."
"Dec 18, 2015",2,"Journey to Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens 
Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones - Movie Review
Never in my born days would I have believed George Lucas could have completely lost the plot like he did making this film. Apart from Ms Portmans sexy curves there is nothing redeeming in this film whatsoever.

The plot, narrative, screenplay and script leave an awful lot to be desired. The scripting of the characters is so empty of any feeling I was sat there in my chair using the force to find it. Sadly it didn`t improve. The digital media the film was made with is far too stale and not near enough technologically advanced to produce a film with. Long shots might looks superb, but sadly they don`t give the viewer the whole picture.

This film is an insult to the star wars genre. The plot is far too overcomplicated with little attempt at explaining the situations within the film in any detail. The editing of the film was obviously done by an overzealous butcher with a hatchet because in certain parts of the film you can see where bits have been snipped without even considering the impact loosing the scene would have on the end product."
"Dec 18, 2015",2.5,"While slightly better than The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones still suffers from stilted dialogue and inconsistent performances, the result of which is a serious lack of investment from an audience who should find this kind of material riveting. What's incredible is how lopsided the action in this work is; there's two entire hours of exposition and build-up leading to an extended battle sequence that constitutes the rest. That final battle sequence is thrilling, however, and makes it all worthwhile, even the end result isn't something outstanding. As with all of the installments in the prequel trilogy, the disdain is largely overblown and misguided, although it's easy to see why some find a film that contains lines of dialogue like ""Around the survivors, a perimeter create!"" to be lacking."
"Dec 18, 2015",2,"Continuing the Star Wars retrospective. I've always thought Episode 2: Attack of the Clones was the most disappointing of the prequels and re-watching hasn't changed my opinion. At this point, the problems of Episode 1 were not insurmountable but there are several molehills in Episode 2 that make for a mountain of trouble. The first 45 minutes are actually pretty good. It's at the 45 minute mark that the threads of the story begin to unravel to the point where the climax of the last 45 minutes is an incoherent mess. In principle, there's nothing wrong with the casting of Hayden Christensen as Anakin (at least, nothing that rewrites for a small amount of dialogue couldn't fix). Anyway, you can see why he got the role. A really BIG problem is the ZERO chemistry between him and Natalie Portman. I don't understand why (Did these actors not like each other? Did one of them have bad breath? Were the Joey Tribbiani rules of acting in play, i.e. there's no heat, they're having sex?). It's a mystery. I don't have a problem with Anakin going nuts and killing everyone in the Tusken Raider village as retribution for the murder of this mother as a 'Darth Vader' trigger point. I do have a BIG problem with Padme's declaration of love occurring AFTER that event. This is a direct consequence of Anakin being 3-4 years too young in Episode 1, which makes the transition to love story in this film much more difficult and awkward. Leaving to almost the last piece of dialogue in the film to explain who ordered the creation of the Clone army is irritating (and I'm still not sure if I correctly understand). Count Dooku is also extraneous. I can't help but think the prequels would have benefited from a consistent 'front-and-center' villain by leaving Darth Maul's death until early in the third film, letting its best prequel villain assume the role of Count Dooku in the story (Palpatine is clearly the 'behind-the-scenes' puppet master villain of the prequels). All-in-all, Episode 2 is a huge disappointment for what it is but also for digging deeper a very large hole that Episode 3 almost had no chance to ever escape (no matter how great it might have been). Yoda's light sabre fight is cool, though. Mark's Grade: C-"
"Dec 17, 2015",3.5,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones [Lucas, 2002] It is somewhat impressive, but it just feels remarkably detached. 6.5/10"
"Dec 17, 2015",4,Or the attack of Hayden's Christensen's bad acting? While still boasting an exciting finale and a good fight scene of Count Dooku vs. Team Jedi...this movie suffers from being overlong and slightly cheesy at times. Ranked out of the first six this is clearly 5/6.
"Dec 17, 2015",2,"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is worse than and better than The Phantom Menace. The action sequences were good, but some were strange and unusual. The acting in this is bad and Anakin acts a little weird around Padme. I personally thought it was a mess of CGI and no realistic special effects. And, woohoo, less Jar Jar Binks! So, in conclusion, this movie is a little better than The Phantom Menace, but in some ways, it isn't. It's still a failure of a Star Was movie!"
"Dec 17, 2015",3.5,"Originally, I was going to give it a 7/10, as it is the worse of the six films, but I decided after watching it again  after several years that the last 40 minutes are pretty darn good especially when they show the image of the Death Star and when Yoda brings out his lightsaber!  So I bumped it up to a 7.5/10.  The first half is awfully long and there is some really bad dialog, mostly by Anakin and Padme."
"Dec 17, 2015",1.5,"By FAR and AWAY, the most disappointing Star Wars film of them all. I was hoping for a big surge after Episode I, which wasn't this bad, as it had  some good moments (the Jedi).   Only watch this to get the continuity for Ep.III, Revenge of the Sith. Worst thing of all is that the love affair between Amidala and Anakin is JUST not believable. The dialogue is AWFUL. Natalie Portman does her best to make you believe that she is in love, and almost succeeds (...she can act...), but Christensen cannot seal the deal. He's whiny and annoying. What is it that she falls in love with? I don't get it. This is a central relationship in the story and no one believes that they are in love. I do credit Lucas with minimizing Jar Jar's role. Also, Obi wan improves every scene that he is in. This is a tedious watch. The very end against Count Dooku isn't bad, but not enough to save this film. This could have been so much better. Natalie Portman makes a great Amidala, but Anakin needed to be portrayed by an actor that could evoke a chemistry with Portman."
"Dec 17, 2015",1.5,"I was very reluctant to re-watch this movie because I literally have no good memories with this one, or any memories of it at all. That's the film's biggest problem, you can't recall anything in it, it's kind of just ""there"". Just sitting there, doing absolutely nothing. I feared it would be just as terrible and awful as any other Star Wars fan said it was, but to be honest, I didn't think it was that terrible to sit through. 

Now, don't get me wrong. This film was bad, like... REALLY bad, but the writing was so tremendously awful that I found it really entertaining. It's not like ""Phantom Menace"" where it's sometimes bad and sometimes good. Instead it's sometimes really bad, but sometimes really funny. It seems George Lucas and this second writer (Jonathan Hales) had no idea what the hell they're doing, and it shows... it seriously shows... 

There's barely anything I actually like in this movie. Ewan McGregor still does a good job as Obi-Wan and John Williams' score is alright, but it certainly is my least favorite Star Wars soundtrack.

One scene I like in concept and almost in execution was whenever Anakin finds his dying mother. She ends up saying ""I love you"" and dies in his arms, pretty cliche but it was pretty sad as well. Sadly, it's followed up by two really terrible scenes (one of them very funny). 

The first scene is immediately after Anakin's mom dies, he slaughters all the Tuskin Raiders. Why? It's pretty clear Lucas is trying to show the audience that Anakin is moving towards the dark side with all these terrible things happening to him, but why does he have to kill the sand people? It would of been so much better if he had just snuck out of the camp with his mother's body and went back to Padme and his family members without killing anyone. Have him swallow the sadness like Luke did in the '77 Star Wars. 

The second scene is when Anakin returns to Padme and has an outburst of how he killed all the sand people and how much he hates them, complete with him tearing up about it. It's so damn funny, but I feel really bad for Hayden Christensen (actor who plays Anakin). I get the impression that he's really trying to give a good performance, but Lucas' script is so terrible that it becomes so hilariously bad. 

The digital effects are both pretty good and very bad, mostly suffering by the fact that instead of 20% practical effects it's now around 5%-10% practical, just about everything in this movie is a digital effect. A lot of it looks really bad, especially the greenscreen bits. 

""Attack of the Clones"" is so much worse than ""Phantom Menace"", it wasn't as horrendous to sit through like I thought it would be, but I still think it is definitely the worst Star Wars movie we ever got. I am never going back to watch this movie unless I'm in the mood for watching a movie that's ""So bad it's funny"". 

I'm gonna try to make it my goal to see every Star Wars movie in a movie theater, but when I end up only having ""Attack of the Clones"" as the final movie to see, I hope it's with my friends so that we could have a ""MST3K/RiffTrax"" sort of commentary. That's how hilariously bad this movie is, I'll never be able to take it seriously. 

I didn't even touch on how they gave Yoda a stupid baby sized lightsaber and how that goes against everything he stood for in the Original Trilogy..."
"Dec 17, 2015",3,Much better Star Wars film than the Phantom Menace. Scores big with Count Dooku and the epic battle between the battle droids and clone troopers at the end. Weak love story story between Anakin and Padme keeps Attack of the Clones from being the best of the series.
"Dec 17, 2015",4,"Definitely my least favorite of the prequel trilogy, but enjoyable nevertheless."
"Dec 16, 2015",2,"Like its predecessor, Attack of the Clones still had problems throughout the movie itself. Sure Jar Jar Binks doesn't bother me that much from this movie but Hayden Christensen was a bad choice for the role for Anakin Skywalker. If the acting was fixed just enough, it would've been better than the Phantom Menace."
"Dec 16, 2015",5,"Highly underrated. This is the second darkest of the films after ROTS. 

And the Clone Troopers are way better than Stormtroopers.  

Jango was perfect and I loved the idea of him being the initial template for the Troopers.

And seeing Yoda fight. I remember the feeling in the theater of OMFG! Me and my friends were saying stuff like ""Whoop Dooku's ass!"" at the screen."
"Dec 16, 2015",2,It seems as though it was forgotten that the film did not have to be complex to be good.
"Dec 15, 2015",2.5,"Surprisingly better than its first film, Attack of the clones delivers an action packed amazing special.......but waaaaaaaaaaaay to much CGI. What again makes this movie bad is the CGI. The CGI is overdone and you don't get the same fee as the others because their is no built set pieces, good actors or dialogue, or even enough light saber battle to keep you battling through this. All in all, Star Wars Episode 2 - Attack of Clones is another over hyped bad prequel."
"Dec 14, 2015",4,"en realidad me encanto esta pelicula es increible la historia y todo lo demas es increible pero lo que mas me gusto fue la relacion entre anakyn y padme en realidad me enamore del personaje de natalie porman ok no, en fin la pelicula es buena y alusinante para mi gusto una de las mejores"
"Dec 14, 2015",2,"Episode II richtet sich an all diejenigen, welche die alten Teile kultisch verehren. Man mag staunen über die Landschaften, welche George Lucas entwirft oder über seine Ansammlungen von Aliens. Wer nun aber ohne Vorkenntnisse einfach einen guten Science Fiction Film sehen will, der wird enttäuscht sein. Die grosse Schwäche der Epiode II sind die Dialoge. Obwohl Star Wars noch nie für tiefsinnige Gespräche stand, ist dieser Mangel in Episode II eklatant. Störend wirkt das vor allem durch den Umstand, dass während der ersten Stunde fast unentwegt geredet wird. Ganz so als ob wir uns nicht etwa in einem SciFi befänden, wird über das Für und Wider von Politik debattiert. Die besseren Star Wars Episoden sind vom klassischen Abenteuerfilm inspiriert und kommen voller Energie und Esprit daher. Hier aber wird die Handlung durch endloses Geplapper vorangetrieben. Obi-Wan Kenobi, Padme Amidala und Anakin Skywalker sprechen dabei so steif und formal, dass sie kaum noch als Persönlichkeiten wahrgenommen werden. Der Rest des Films wird vertan mit der Liebesgeschichte zwischen Padme und Anakin. Obwohl hier Natalie Portman als zweifellos grosse Schauspielerin agiert, wirkt diese ""Romanze"" geradezu verklemmt. Liebe wird von beiden als schwere Bürde begriffen, die kaum auszuhalten ist. Vorgetragen als einziges Klichee, woran wiederum die Dialoge schuld sind. Unfreiwilige Komik nicht ausgeschlossen: ""I don't like the sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating--not like you. You're soft and smooth."" (Anakin zu Padme). Besonders schade ist, dass Star Wars so etwas wie ein vorauszusetzendes Publikum hat.

"Dec 14, 2015",1,"¿Cómo superas una película mala? Haciendo una peor, por supuesto.

Ambientada 10 años después de los eventos de La Amenaza Fantasma, Anakin (Christensen) debe proteger a la Senadora Amidala (Portman), quien es blanco de un posible intento de asesinato al mismo tiempo que lidia con visiones sobre el posible destino de su madre. Mientras tanto, Obi-Wan (McGregor) debe descubrir quién está detrás de la creación de un misterioso ejército de clones para la República, hecho a base del mercenario Jango Fett (Morrison), quien trabaja para el despiadado sith Conde Dooku (Lee).

Puesto en simples palabras, éste film es exponencialmente más malo que el anterior. En serio, en increíble. Es como si George Lucas y su equipo hubieran leído todas las malas críticas para luego decir: Debemos hacer lo mismo, sólo que peor.

El film nos presenta a unos Obi-Wan y Anakin más viejos, más experimentados, más... ¿funcionales? Se supone que han pasado 10 años como maestro y aprendiz, traten de mostrar algo de química, chicos. McGregor, tú estás bien, en realidad. El verdadero problema aquí es Christensen. En serio, el gran error de la primera película fue elegir a un niño que no sabía actuar... como Anakin. Y ahora, eligen a un joven que no sabe actuar... en general. Es increíble lo mal que hace... todo. Sus líneas (que de por sí están terriblemente escritas) no son entregadas correctamente, sus expresiones están fuera de lugar, cero credibilidad. Horrible. Y él es el protagonista. ¡¿Me están jodiendo?!
Al igual que en la anterior, en esta película la incomodidad reina en las actuaciones de su reparto. Sin embargo, hay que darles algo. Se ven un poco más acostumbrados a ser mal dirigidos. McGregor se da el placer de experimentar un poco con su rol, y la adición del grandioso Christopher Lee como el villano de turno se agradece enormemente. Algo que no se puede negar del trabajo de Lucas en esta maldita trilogía es que crea excelentes personajes de villano, misteriosos como Darth Maul, imponentes como el Conde Dooku, despiadados como Darth Sidious.

Nuevamente, la historia avanza a tropezones, descuidada y torpe. No hay nada de sutileza ni vistazos de una narración elaborada. Las inconsistencias temáticas, narrativas y de los personajes siguen ahí, acentuándose cada vez más. Algo que se debe rescatar de este film es que hayan tomado nota del odio desmesurado hacia Jar Jar, por lo que su papel (aunque aún ridículo, es un tipo increíblemente torpe e idiota, y es senador) es reducido considerablemente.

Si en la película anterior, un aspecto positivo eran los efectos especiales, en esta es un aspecto negativo. Y es que Lucas hace un abuso imperdonable del CGI, llevando a sus actores a mayores niveles de dificultad sin ofrecer ningún tipo de asistencia. Pocos ambientes se sienten reales. La mayoría de las locaciones para las escenas se sienten como sets decorados por la para nada desapercibida presencia de los arreglos digitales.
¿Y recuerdan a los soldados imperiales? En este film se cuenta sobre su origen, un montón de clones hechos a semejanza del actor Temuera Morrison, Jango Fett. Lo interesante, y algo decepcionante, de esto es saber que para ésta película no se hizo ningún, NINGÚN, traje de clon. Todos son CGI, hechos por computadora. Es un poco descorazonador saber que la esencia de lo que hizo a Star Wars grande, su inteligente uso de efectos prácticos, ya no está aquí.

Pero éste film, al igual que el anterior y el posterior, prueban lo que ya sabemos. Lucas es un gran director visual. Es por eso que las peleas se ven tan geniales. Hay una secuencia en el lluvioso planeta Kamino, donde se encuentra la fábrica de clones, en la que Obi-Wan tiene una impresionante y entretenida lucha con Jango Fett, padre del cazarrecompensas Boba Fett, del Imperio Contraataca y el Regreso del Jedi. Y es que es un duelo bastante equiparado, con dos tipos rudos y experimentados.

Otro punto a favor, y repito, al igual que en el anterior film y el posterior film, es la música. John Williams es, sin ningún lugar a dudas mi compositor favorito en la historia. Porque es capaz de tomar propiedades como Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park y convertirlas en íconos gracias a sus inolvidables temas principales. Y su talento se muestra cuando toma películas como ésta asquerosa trilogía y, aún así, puede infundirles toques de brillantez con su música. Digan lo que quieran de este film, el Love Theme es espectacular.

Lamentablemente, ese Love Theme es parte del concepto de una historia de amor tan fallida como aburrida. Anakin y Padmé. Un amor increíble. Digo, literalmente es increíble. No se puede creer. Es ridículo. Esta historia de amor tiene tanta química como un fanfiction entre mi uña y un caracol baboso muerto. Es lamentable que la escritura de Lucas alcance un nuevo nivel de mediocridad, pero es lo que es. Matizada con subtramas como la muerte de la madre de Anakin y su resentimiento hacia los Jedis, el desarrollo del romance es rocoso y sin sentido alguno.

La estúpida historia nos lleva al tercer acto, donde toma lugar la captura de Obi-Wan, Anakin y Padmé, para su posterior ejecución en una arena que sirve como un show para los habitantes del planeta Geonosis. La escena es mala. Hay que decirlo, muy mala. Malos efectos especiales mezclados con piruetas extrañas de mirar y acción física mal construida.
Sin embargo, ¡aquí llegan los Jedis! Lo reconozco, me encanta esa escena donde podemos ver a todos los Jedis encender sus sables de luz. Esto es lo que queríamos ver. Por supuesto, hasta que todos mueren de formas patéticas a manos de droides que son tan torpes e inútiles como el innombrable Jar Jar. ¡Diablos, lo nombré!
Esto marca el inicio de las famosas Guerras Clones, con el Maestro Windu (Jackson) liderando a los Jedis junto a los clones.
Y luego llega un momento que nadie sabía que estábamos esperando. Digo, luego de ver en La Amenaza Fantasma que Yoda también era viejo antes, nadie creía que lo veríamos en acción. Sin embargo, inesperadamente llega a rescatar a Obi-Wan y Anakin de Dooku, entregándonos una escena de pelea bastante cool.

Okay, entonces la cuenta va así. Escenas de acción: 1 punto. Música: 1 punto. Todo lo demás, simplemente horrible mal cine."
"Dec 13, 2015",1.5,"My gosh, this one sucks! This is the absolute worst out of the franchise because of the overdose in CGI, the perverted lines from Hayden Christensen as older Anakin (""I don't like sand""?! REALLY?!), and for the most part, IT. WAS. A. SNOREFEST.

And somehow, we're bringing back Hayden Christensen in the sequel trilogy?
Whose idea was that? Was someone just being a terrible director in the prequels so he'll do better in the future with a different one to instruct him?

Either way, not a fan of this one."
"Dec 13, 2015",2.5,"Although it benefits with more thrilling action and emotional themes than the original, Episode Two is still cluttered with bad writing, acting, set designs and once again over-use of cgi."
"Dec 13, 2015",3,"WHAT I LIKED: Unlike with the Phantom Menace, this prequel actually has us excited. Thanks to two great plots switching back and forth for the majority of 'attack of the clones,' audiences can actually begin to feel tense or expectant. What's more is there's LOTS more action in place of people sitting and talking space rubbish.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It's just so dragged out thanks to politics that'd baffle any non Star Wars fans, poor writing and one 45 minute explosion of CGI action at the end. Plus why Lucas feels the need for the injection of such awful humor is ridiculous.
VERDICT: Not as dull as it's predecessor, 'Attack of the clones' is fairly good until the third act where it's just senseless action."
"Dec 12, 2015",3,"""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of The Clones"" is a good Sci-Fi movie of 2002. This film is a better film than 1999's ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"". The plot to this movie is that a bounty hunter is trying to murder ""Padmé Amidala"" after this ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" and ""Anakin Skywalker"" are sent to protect her. Later ""Anakin Skywalker"" and ""Padmé Amidala"" travel to her home planet Naboo. Whilst ""Obi-Wan"" attempts to find the bounty hunter. The plot is okay, except that ""Anakin"" and ""Padmé"" discover their love, this took up 30 percent of the movie and it's just boring to watch. It's as if ""George Lucas"" turned a Sci-Fi into a love story for teenage girls. Yet again ""Yoda"" has no humor and looks like an animated character. ""Hayden Christensen"" is annoying to watch, he's a bad actor and wrong for the role of ""Anakin Skywalker"". Other than him the acting is okay ""Natalie Portman"" and ""Ewan McGregor"" are probably the best actors in this film. The music in ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of The Clones"" is good, some music is wrong for certain scenes. This movie was filmed pretty well, this movie had the same problem as the last, in ten years the special effects don't hold up when compared to the original trilogy. This movie was directed pretty good. With this movie it looks like ""Georg Lucas"" actually tried to direct, in the previous film he did nothing. If you are a person who enjoys the ""Star Wars Prequels"" then good for you, I'm not one of those people. I give ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of The Clones"" a 6/10."
"Dec 12, 2015",3.5,"_REWATCH REVIEW_
This is a great improvement over the first episode, though it still has many flaws... The story continues 10 years after the events of the first episode and Padme is almost assassinated. Obi-Wan and Anakin come back to her to keep her safe from the assassin. Soon enough, Obi-Wan is given another task including some betrayals and an army of clones, and Anakin is left alone to keep Padme safe from danger back on her home planet. Anakin, however, gets a sudden urge to find his mother back on Tatooine, so he and Padme to go to Tatooine. There, more stuff happens and so on and so on, I won't talk more about the plot due to spoilers. The acting is much better, there aren't any kid actors (besides Bobba, but he isn't on-screen that many times). Though Hayden Christensen can sometimes be amazingly awkward! He plays Anakin and most of the scenes with him and Padme are so goddamn creepy that it's sometimes a bit a hard to watch. Anakin can sometimes strike you as the ""overly attached girlfriend"". Speaking of those scenes, the dialogue is very cheesy and the romance is ridiculous. The CGI has improved greatly since the first episode and it now looks much better. The direction is also great. This movie feels like it was written/directed by a different person than the one who did the first episode, even though it's all George Lucas. All in all, it's a great improvement over the first episode due there not being Jar Jar Binks that much in it and due to not as many kid actors. The CGI and the battle scenes were more satisfying, as well as Anakin's character development."
"Dec 11, 2015",3.5,Great movie! Although the dialogue could of done better I did enjoy this movie. Rating B-

7.1

""A Star Wars Romance Movie with real emotional moments"""
"Dec 10, 2015",3,"Despite some very cool moments. Attack of the clones suffers from dated CGI, green/blue screens, sloppily written dialogue, and poor acting from Hayden Christensen. At least George Lucas lessened Jar Jar Binks."
"Dec 08, 2015",0.5,"With Only A Small Amounts Of Improvements Over Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones Still Suffers From The Problems Of Phantom Menace And Gives Birth To A Romance That's So Bad, 50 Shades Of Grey Is Looking Good Now(By 9%)"
"Dec 08, 2015",3,"Effetti visivi nettamente migliorati, con una narrazione che si focalizza maggiormente nell'evoluzione psicologica dei vari personaggi, nonostante si perda ancora tempo in questioni politiche noiose e poco coinvolgenti. Si tratta di un deciso passo nella giusta direzione, che ripara in parte gli errori del primo film e ristabilisce un ordine generale per poter proseguire nell'attesissimo finale."
"Dec 07, 2015",2,"This is CG gone wild. Reckless, embarrassing. What's worse is watching 2 people with no chemistry attempt to fall in love. At least the scenery on Naboo is pretty? A combo of script &amp; direction (ok, and maybe acting) fails with angsty teenage Anakin are horrid. The only big upside is the appearance of Count Dooku (worst possible name, seriously) as it leads to a fight with Yoda - albeit a digital Yoda. Also... the Clone Army is cool."
"Dec 06, 2015",3,"Otra película solo de relleno, en realidad no se nota un gran esfuerzo de parte de parte de George Lucas al ponerse a grabar esta película."
"Dec 06, 2015",2.5,"Attack of the Clones seems to favor mediocre CGI lightsaber battles over dramatic story telling, falling flat from the same boring flaws of its predecessor. (D+)"
"Dec 06, 2015",3.5,Great action scenes break up mediocre drama and dialogue. I'm firmly in the camp of some star wars is better than no star wars. paved the way for great Clone Wars TV series.
"Dec 06, 2015",3,"Better than the first. Boring at times, but entertaining especially for the die hard fans."
"Dec 05, 2015",2,"It's not a good movie, because it only depends on action. Worst star wars movie by far."
"Dec 04, 2015",1,"80% of this film is stale dialogue and logic defying decisions. 90 minutes of no clones attacking, and this film has dug so many contradictory plot holes that it seems like I'm watching the lucid imagination of a fan fiction author."
"Dec 04, 2015",1,"For the source material they had to work with, and the budget, this movie couldn't have been much worse.  I think episode I is 2 stars, episode II is 1 star, and episode 3, 2 stars again.  To back that up:
Characters 0 stars
Script / dialog - negative 3 stars 
Effects 0 stars (too much CGI, no realism to setting)
Plot 0 stars - so so boring

This was not the cast's fault.  Most of them are talented they just had nothing to work with."
"Dec 02, 2015",1.5,I am such a huge fan of Star Wars and all the lore surrounding it.  But this...this is just a bad film.
"Dec 02, 2015",3.5,I would say it is the formation of Darth Vader and what's behind that transformation. I really liked the build around that. Well enough balanced with the action buy not forgetting the main core of the beginning of the dark side!
"Dec 02, 2015",3,"That jerk Jar Jar is still in this, thankfully he doesn't say much. Anakin is a horny emo teenager now. WHERE do I get a dress like Natalie Portman's at the beach house?? This ridiculous high school romance is the only thing that's working for me. They kiss and PadmÃ© shuts it down, yet keeps walking around in lingerie. I'm having a hard time looking at Ewan McGregor and not imagining him singing on top of a giant elephant in Paris. Anakin's Mom dies and he is filled with inconsolable, murderous rage. Yoda gets into a light saber fight. Anakin's hand gets cut off and he gets a new robot hand. Anakin and PadmÃ© fall in love and get married back at the beach house. There's some stuff about clones."
"Dec 02, 2015",2.5,"Star Wars : Attack of the Clones is another example of a sequel that's not as good as the original. The Anakin and Padme love story was bad because it felt to rushed. The Han and Leia love story was good because it took some time for them to be in love. Despite that part of Attack of the Clones, I felt like they were trying to hard to make Obi-Wan a badass. Even though he had some awesome scenes, most of them made us want to feel he was an awesome Jedi. To be honest I liked the politics in Attack of the Clones. I thought it was really cool."
"Dec 02, 2015",4,This movie was better than the first. Especially with the dual between Master Yoda and Count Duku/Lord Tyranous. We definitely see the transformation of Anikin going to the dark side.
"Dec 01, 2015",3.5,"While nothing in Attack of the Clones is nearly as awesome as the very best things in The Phantom Menace, as an overall film it works better in my opinion. Still, the film is definitely not without its flaws. The plot is once again fairly solid although harder to follow than the one in The Phantom Menace, and this time Lucas actually manages to inject some personality into the characters of Anakin and Obi-Wan. The banter between them which is one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie doesn't last too long as they split up fairly early into the film. As for the overall narrative of the film, Anakin going off to find his mother comes off as kind of separate from the overall narrative and doesn't make much sense even if I understand its purpose as setting up Anakin's fear of death for Episode III. But that and especially the way C-3PO is written into the movie is so contrived and makes no goddamn sense in relation to the events of the original trilogy.

As for the romance between Anakin and Padmé, as a kid I never minded it because I was too pre-occupied with the action sequences. But now I've rewatched the film. NOW I see what everyone was talking about when they said how shit the romance is. I was laughing my ass off through most of the ""romantic"" scenes 'cause they're so laughably bad - they're such utter shite. Padmé and Anakin have absolutely no chemistry together - the only reason they fall in love is because George Lucas says so. The only good moment is right before the two are taken out to the arena at the end of the film. That exchange and that moment between them was so great I actually got chills watching it. Sadly the build-up to that great moment is utter laughable shit.

Thankfully the romance doesn't take up most of the film though, and there are still lots of awesome things in the film. Jango Fett is awesome because he and Boba are clones, hence one being awesome means the other is too. Sir Christopher Lee is always a delight in everything he's in, and seeing him with a lightsaber is just too awesome. The lightsaber battles at the end of the film are full of great moments too even if not to the level of the previous film - Anakin fighting with two lightsabers, although briefly, and of course YODA WITH A FRIGGIN' LIGHTSABER. I will never let that little kid in me who flips out from Yoda jumping around with a lightsaber die - I refuse to become cynical enough to let that childlike glee in me go.

One final comment regarding the visual side of Attack of the Clones though. While the imagery and the visuals, as in all the prequels, are stunning and gorgeous, it absolutely hurts the film that most of it is CGI because you can tell the actors are in front of a green screen, everything around them looking unnaturally plastic and fake - separate from the flesh-and-blood actors. Visually stunning the film may be, but unbelievably fake-looking and never believable.

7+/10"
"Nov 30, 2015",2.5,"Possbily the weakest installment of the Star Wars series, The biggest problems with Attack of the Clones lie in the acting and over-use of CGI. 

As always the score by John Williams is execellent as usual, even if a lot of it has been reyled from the other films, and Ewen Macgregor, Ian Macdirmind and Frank Oz are great as Obi-Wan, Palpatine and Yoda, with the former getting involved in a mystery sub-plot involving the orgins of the Stormtroopers, and Boba Fett and the latter, despite being reimagined in CGI does admitally get some awesome moents in this film even though his chracter probably should'nt have a lightsaber in the first place.

However these few good elements are let down by the awful desicions made on the screenplay such as having Jar Jar, being the whole reason why the Empire was formed in the first place and Hayden Chirsten's Anakin Skywalker and Natalie Portman's Padme Amidala, sharing the worst screen chemisty ever made until Twilght six years later. Thieer acting is also horrendous, with Hayden coming off as the worst as his whiney prissy nature makes the audience hard to belive that this guy will eventaully become Vader.

Even IlM's visual effects are not that great  despite the location shot scenes still looking great, with  Geonosis looking like a pinker version of Tattoine and the CGI backgrounds, such as  the interior of the Jedi Temple and especialy the majority of the final battle between Yoda and Count Dooku looking like a Ps2 videogame by comparion.

Overall, despite those few psotive elements and some other easter eggs such as Christopher Lee's preformace and more hints towards the origgnal trilogy then The Phamtom Menace, Attack of the Clones, is utinamtely onot only the weakest Star Wars film, but a purely Averege Sci-fi flick, which is hugely disspapinting for something like Star Wars."
"Nov 30, 2015",1,"Complete trash. Painful dialogue, horrible CGI, cringe worthy acting, and overly choreographed and terribly executed action scenes. This is everything that was bad about The Phantom Menace x100. An embarrassment to Star Wars."
"Nov 29, 2015",4,"This Star Wars movie is better than its predecessor, but suffers from bad dialogue especially in the the romance scenes and a little overuse of CGI. The last half hour is one of the most thrilling and exhilarating parts in the saga especially the arena scene. Over better than the phantom menace but suffers from flat dialogue and to much CGI."
"Nov 29, 2015",2,Quizá el peor episodio de la saga.
"Nov 29, 2015",1,a few improvements but still terrible
"Nov 29, 2015",3,The story is better here but the pacing is WAY off. The dialogue is so stale. I'm convinced George Lucas never had a romantic conversation in his life because the Anakin Padme relationship is just the worst. Count Dooku? Jedi Master Sifo Dias? Think we need to know anymore about these guys? Thank goodness The Clone Wars stepped in to help this move out.
"Nov 29, 2015",3,"REWATCH. A massive improvement on Episode 1. Jar Jar Binks had limited screen time so, the only way was up. Only negatives for me, the running time. At least 20 minutes could have ended up on the cutting room floor. Christensen is really wooden but not annoying; McGregor is still badly cast but much better in this than 'The Phantom Menace'. Te highlights are the chase after Zam Wesell involving Kenobi and Skywalker, the Jedifest in the Coliseum would make a dead man cum. As a young kid, I modeled my life on Master Yoda and always wanted to see him in action. The little green dude goes toe to toe with Christopher Lee and doesn't disappoint.The action in the Clone Factory is first class and early on I loved the faint use of 'John Williams the Imperial March' as Anakin begins to lean towards the dark side. The 'Tusken Raiders' are nasty cunts and the groundwork is in place for the Episode III."
"Nov 26, 2015",3,"Although this film impresses with visual appeal and exciting action sequences, ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" faces the same problems as its predecessor, with a vague plot and forgettable characters."
"Nov 26, 2015",3,"This is my least favourite out of all the Star Wars movies. It is poorly written, has some of the worst dialogues in movie history, and is just an overall boring movie, with only one redeeming factor, and that is Christopher Lee as Count Dooku and his battle with Master Yoda. I hate every scene with Christensen and Portman, and also the Obi-Wan exploring shit thing was not enjoyable in any way."
"Nov 26, 2015",4.5,Fresh good fight beautifull all point
"Nov 25, 2015",0.5,"Watch Mr. Plinkett's (Red Letter Media) masterful review and laugh and cry at the same time. This is the movie that would have destroyed Yoda's character (if it actually belonged to the Star Wars saga, which it doesn't)."
"Nov 23, 2015",3,"It's Star Wars so it captures many fun aspects of the original sequel trilogy but my word the clunkiness of how they transition young lil 'yippee' Ani to Vader via broody, tempestuous, overacting, bad acting, Darth Hayden is awful. Add to that the least romantic coupling imaginable it's a wonder how the prophecy (offspring) was ever reached. Once again, like TPM, AOTC is an overly jumpy, convoluted plot, that sets up much and delivers on little. That said, hiding in astroid fields, lightsaber battles and a quality big bad in Dooko bring this to acceptable levels of far flung Galaxy entertainment. Nice little intro to Young Master Fett too."
"Nov 22, 2015",0.5,Worst Star Wars movie ever because of Hayden Christensen and the end fight between yoda and count dooku it is horrible
"Nov 22, 2015",2.5,"I have openly admitted that Attack of the Clones is my least favorite Star Wars film but its still has its moments. Most of those moments ... are at the end of the film. We start off 10 years after the events of Episode I with now Senator Amadalla returning to Coruscant only to be a target for assassination. Obi-wan and Anakin are assigned to protect her and end up chasing a bounty hunter through the city. This first action scene is heavy on the cg and while there are some good sound effects its isn't really that great. We get some peppered in moments of banter between Obi-wan and Anakin and we get a super whiney Anakin which is super annoying. Then Obi-wan is sent to investigate who is trying to kill Padme and Anakin and Padme are sent to Naboo to hide. This is where we get some of the worst scenes in Star Wars history. The dialogue and acting are really bad. There is absolutely no chemistry between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christiansen. Its really hard to watch. Eventually Anakin's continued nightmares about his mother lead him back home to Tatooine with Padme. He finds out his mother has been kidnapped by sand people and he heads to rescue her. He finds her but she dies in his arms and this is the first slip into the dark side for Anakin. This scene I really liked. The music and anger in Anakin's face is awesome but I wish it didn't cut away and actually showed Anakin slaughtering the sand people. When Anakin returns to Padme and tells her what he has done she surprisingly doesn't seem alarmed. I think what Lucas was trying to portray here is Padme keeping Anakin from going full dark side but it just isn't done very well.
 

While all of this going on we get a lot of Obi-wan investigating on the planet Kamino where a clone army is being assembled without the knowledge of the Jedi counsel. He runs into the bounty hunter hired to assassinate Padme, Jango Fett. We get a cool little battle between the two and Jango and his son Buba Fett escape. Obi-wan follows him and we get an awesome space battle in a asteroid field. The sound of the sonic bombs is so freakin awesome. He ends up following him into a droid factory where Count Dooku is plotting a war. He sends a message to Anakin right before he is captured by Dooku.
 

Anakin sends the message to the Jedi Consel and then try to rescue Obi-wan. Both him and Padme end up getting captured and with Obi-wan are put in a fighting pit with some creatures. This scene is okay but nothing really special. All of the sudden Anakin and Padme are deeply madly in love and we get some more horrible dialogue.
 
Then the movie finally picks up. Mace Windu and a ton of Jedi drop in to rescue Obi-wan and Anakin. They are beaten but then Yoda and the Clone troopers rescue everyone. An attack immediately commonsense of the droid factory by the clone and so the Clone Wars begin. The battle scenes while short are pretty epic and then we get a duel between Obi-wan, Anakin, and Count Dooku. The Count easily defeats them chopping off Anakin's arm. Yoda steps in at the end and we getting a pretty cool light saber battle. I can remember standing ovations when Yoda chases off the Count. You can clearly see that he is no match for Yoda.
 

We get a final scene that shows us the Count Dooku is clearly the apprentice of Darth Sidius and Anakin and Padme marry in secret. Overall the horrible dialogue and chemistry between Anakin and Padme almost ruin this movie completely. But the cool action scenes at the end keep it from being complete garbage."
"Nov 21, 2015",2.5,"The CGI does not hold up ,actually ng is bad and the whole thing feels rushed. still has a good soundtrack and a few things not cringe worthy. 2.5/5"
"Nov 21, 2015",4.5,Like the increased emphasis of the creation of the close army and Skywalker's fall.  Finally we know why Jar Jar is there to essentially bring the fail of the republic in his own special clueless way.  As with All star wars movies I say leave your expectations out side and enjoy the ride
"Nov 19, 2015",0.5,"inclined with more wonderment than its ruefully sober predecessor, 'episode ii' is a welcome reversion to star wars vein. the dialogue still fails to illuminate, but the relationships between leads actually proffers real purpose this time, such as a tenable anakin-padme liaison. a droid factory skirmish and the battle of geonosis are imposing, invigorating feats."
"Nov 19, 2015",2,"Attack of the Clones is terrible. When I was younger I actually liked it, but I was skipping the dialogue to go straight to the action. Quite frankly that's a better way to watch the movie. 

The script is lifeless, the CGI is unconvincing and the acting is emotionless. It features the most forced and creepy love story ever told by two incredibly rigid performances from inexperienced actors. 

The only praise this movie deserves is towards its art department, which did a fairly good job creating the alien worlds. But once an actor is bluescreened into the CGI background, they stand out horribly with poor lighting that doesn't come close to a realistic effect."
"Nov 18, 2015",3,"If I had to pick a least favourite film in the entire Star Wars Saga, it would be ""Attack of the Clones"". Much like it's predecessor if not more, suffers from convoluted plotting and some underdeveloped characters. Also in some more broader hindsight the subject matter and themes of the series is better explored and expands the Star Wars Universe in an interesting and exciting way, towards a more pivotal point in the Saga. While the action, spectacle and special effects are fantastic to witness, once some quite dated otherwise still enjoyable for the film's fantasy element. Even upon addressing the issue Hayden Christensen, he's certainly physically adapted to the role of Anakin, though his line deliveries and drama don't contribute to maturing or developing the character to a further extent throughout the film. Nonetheless, its a film with plenty of redeeming qualities, including some good casting with Christopher Lee literally playing my favourite villain in the prequel trilogy, while everyone else both physically and mentally adapts to their roles as much as any previous  film in the franchise. If I had to give it some credit, It would have be opening up the biggest chapter in the Star Wars Lore (Clone Wars), and tends to be explored a lot better than just this film alone."
"Nov 16, 2015",4.5,"Better than the first one, this is a great movie. Getting ready for Star Wars VII"
"Nov 15, 2015",2,"It's soooo BORING...... I thought this was the most boring of the prequels, at least in Episode I, it was.... Laughably bad, this is just, no. Why a love story? People like me aren't going to remember this horrible plot."
"Nov 13, 2015",3,"3/5.  Attack of the Clones has some of the worst moments of the series, all of which involve Anakin and Padme.  But Obi-Wan's story is solid and the actions scenes are pretty fun."

"Nov 07, 2015",3,"""I don't like sand "" pretty much sums up hayden's acting.  It ruined this movie and sums up his acting in revenge."
"Nov 06, 2015",3,Memory told me this was much better than Episode I but in all honestly for me it was only marginally better. Boosted by the late introduction of Count Dooku and finally getting to see Yoda kick some butt!
"Nov 06, 2015",2,"If its a Star Wars movie then i should be giving this a five star rating but overall in all honesty this was the most disappointing Star Wars movie of all time. Bad dialogue , bad ending , uninteresting villain , bad ending , awkward love story , its got The Empire Strikes Back formula but poorly simulated and its like they tried to get another lightning in the bottle but they failed. Star Wars prequels have too many gaps in the timeline. I'll give this movie two stars because of some of the action scenes I enjoyed and because I was interested in seeing a ""Young Adult"" Darth Vader before he turned evil."
"Nov 05, 2015",1.5,"Cringeworthy, and sloopy Romance scenes make this movie feel less like Star Wars and more of a ""The Notebook"" feel. The romance scenes felt uneccessary and unfit for a movie like this. Even with the few good action scenes it is still brought down by what seems to be pointless and poor dialogue."
"Nov 02, 2015",2.5,"Star Wars episode 2 fixes some of the of the issues in episode 1, like having less Jar Jar. But adds on to the bad acting, awful writing, and visuals outdated just 13 years later. It does have a few good lightsaber fights, and the asteroid scene is pretty good."
"Nov 01, 2015",4,"Rating: 8/10

I'll tell you this immediately, Attack of the Clones was my least favourite of the series and I've watched it only once, when I first viewed it about 10 years ago. I was a bit disappointed by this movie when I first watched. But a large part of my disappointment came from the fact that I had too many expectations and I've already imagined the story in my head after having watched Revenge of the Sith first, contrary to The Phantom Menace. But there were few things that I did like about this movie as the scenes in Kamino and the battle of Geonosis. Sometimes, a few years back, I happen to pop my old DVD in my computer and watch those specific scenes and skip all the romantic scenes between Anakin and Padme. But I also used to do that with The Empire Strikes Back by skipping all the romantic scenes between Han and Leia. 

I used to find love stories boring and awkward, not just in Star Wars, but in every movies, when I was a teenager. I remember once, in one of my classes of literature, when we were studying the book El-Cid, which is a French tragicomic drama written by Pierre Corneille, our teacher showed us the movie El-Cid from 1961 directed by Anthony Mann featuring Charlton Heston as the protagonist. And since there were a lot of romantic scenes in the movie, many of my friends around me used to mock it and I was too busy thinking to myself: ""Come on! Come on! Hurry up! Skip! Skip!""

But going back to Attack of the Clones, I've watched this movie two times this week-end in order to clarify my thoughts about it. The first time I've watched it, Friday evening, I wasn't really in a good mood in order to enjoy it during the first half of the movie since I was apprehending the romance scenes which were spoken so negatively during the last 13 years and from which I was embarrassed when watching this movie for the first time when I was a teenager.

But when arriving to the specific scene of the fireplace, when Anakin wanted to confess his love for Padme, something struck me and sounded suddenly familiar. Since I didn't watch the movie in English, I've watched it in French from Canada instead (I understand both English and French), I've realized that it wasn't Lucas' writing and script that were the problem for that specific scene. The lines and dialogue were the same in both English and French, with very few exceptions. The only difference is that the dialogue and the romantic lines sounded much better and more convincing in French than in English.

The reason why those lines sounded familiar to me is because I remember that during my classes of literature we came across many romantic poems and drama plays. The one that came back to my mind was a French play which is still very popular today in France, Cyrano de Bergerac, which is a screenplay made of many poems written by Edmond Rostand in the late 19th century. But even if the play was written in the 19th century, the story takes place in the 17th century, a more classic era in France with the revival of art and literature. The play is very hard to come across, particularly the dialogue, and the lines for the main character are very imposing and it takes a lot of training for the ones who have to act in the theater. I remember when I had to read the book, it was just painful trying to understand the lines and I had to ask a lot of help from my teacher.

So I'm pretty sure that Lucas must have taken its inspiration from those kinds of writings in order to write the dialogue during that specific scene, which, I think, is kind of a good idea and very audacious if you want to illustrate a more classic and civilized era in the Star Wars universe. But the reason, I think, why those lines sounded bad is because of the way they were delivered by the actors, it wasn't the lines themselves. As I said earlier, this usually takes a lot of training for the ones who have to act and say those kinds of lines. I've compared the same scene on the fireplace in both English and French, and the persons who had to do the voice acting in French did a better job in order to deliver those lines than the actors themselves.

But I'll be among the people who acknowledge that the romance does feel forced on the first scene when Anakin and Padme are in front of the lake on Naboo, but also too honeyed and cliché and some parts. And despite what I've described earlier concerning the dialogue on the fireplace scene, it doesn't cover some of the ""questionable"" lines I would say, especially the line with ""sand"" which made me scratch my head a little bit. But I think that you have to keep in mind that the main difference between the romance between Han and Leia in The Empire Strikes Back, and the one between Anakin and Padme is that we are dealing with different characters on two different time period. The romance between an outlaw and a princess in a time of civil war is a very seductive concept, especially for the nerd world, and that might be why it works better. In Attack of the Clones we are dealing with a romance between two people who have both strategic and important roles in a more civilized and classic society, a time period before the war. One is a senator and is responsible to represent her people before the government and the entire galaxy and was before Queen, the other one is the guardian of peace and justice and is also responsible for her protection. With such important roles, I rather think that it should be easy to understand why they are not allowed to succumb to their passion and why this romance may sound wobbly and forced.

With that being said, it could be hard to believe that Anakin and Padme are falling in love for the first time in that movie. However, I won't suggest that there weren't any emotional connection or any care between the two before the events on that movie. And I think that one of the reasons why this romance seemed to have happened too suddenly to many fans and viewers is because many of them have discarded The Phantom Menace previously. There's a key scene in The Phantom Menace, that I haven't paid any attention to it until having watched the movie lately, suggesting that there was already a connection starting to rise between Anakin and Padme. It's the scene after they are leaving Tatooine and Anakin gives to Padme a necklace as a present, and Padme says to him: ""Many things will change when we'll reach the capital Ani. But my caring for you will never leave.""

To conclude about the romantic side of the movie, yes it's not perfect and it's wobbly on many parts, especially concerning the way the lines are being delivered. But you know, I've seen far worst and much sillier love stories in other movies and TV series than Attack of the Clones. The romance scene could have been better, especially when finding that the voice-acting in French was better than the actors themselves delivering the lines, making those scenes more convincing than I originally thought it would be. And with that being said, I think that we can agree that Lucas is at the same the solution and the problem for his saga. He can have many great and ambitious ideas but sometimes it's the way he exposes them that can be problematic.

Concerning the other aspects of the movie I'll get to it immediately. Globally, after facing the fact that the romance and the dialogue weren't as bad and I thought after all these years, I've found that Attack of the Clones was a more enjoyable movie than The Phantom Menace when watching it for the second time. Contrary to The Phantom Menace, the pacing seems to be a little bit faster, especially in the second half of the movie, and it felt to be lighter than the first prequel in which the heaviness of its script leaden its pace. Visually, this movie is stunning and I really liked the color scheme in each different scenes. I liked the atmosphere of the movie being one of doubt and ambiguity and the different color scheme help to translate this atmosphere to the viewer. I enjoyed all the scenes with Obi-Wan doing the detective work and Kamino remains one of my favourite locations in the movie alongside Geonosis and Coruscant during the night. The action sequences and the chase with the speeders through Coruscant are still cool until today. The story told in this movie is more interesting to follow and richer on this time period than the prologue presented in The Phantom Menace,and there's a lot more of things going one.

My favourite moment on that movie is when Anakin decides to go and look for his kidnapped mother on the hot desert of Tatooine and when you hear the Duel of the Fates score playing, another of my favourite score, making it another powerful moment in the saga, meaning that Aankin's fate has already been sealed. My other little favourite moment is the shadow play when Padme goes to see Anakin and he tells her to wait for him. Has anyone ever noticed that Anakin's head, on his shadow, looks almost exactly like the Darth Vader's helmet? I've never listened to the DVD or Blu-Ray comments but was the reason behind the choice of Anakin's hair style for Episode II and to film his shadow instead of him on that scene were the reasons to show the Darth Vader shadow on that specific moment?

My little disappointment is that I would have liked if Count Dooku was given more time on screen, especially since it's Christopher Lee playing the character. The other thing that I've found wasn't right is the CGI in this movie. Strangely enough, the CGI used in The Phantom Menace looked better than inAttack of the Clones despite the fact that the second prequel is a more recent movie than Episode I. I don't know if it's because they were using the digital technology for the first time on this movie and it hasn't been done on any other movies before. Even the CGI Yoda in The Phantom Menace (a more recent version than the first CGI Yoda used in 2002 since the change has been done in 2011) looked better than Episode II, particularly in terms of the textures for his skin. Even the clone troopers seemed to be a little bit too shiny. But the CGI still remained very good for the battle droids, the Geonosians and also the 3 big monsters used in the arena for the execution. The special effects mostly hold up very well, but some adjustments and work might be needed on some of the textures for the CGI. I would also admit that Hayden's acting on this movie isn't particularly good, especially on the scene when he reveals that he has killed the Sand people on Tatooine. It even sounded a bit clumsy even when watching it in French.

One of the arguments against this movie (excluding the romance) that can be discarded is that many people have complained about the speeder chase in Coruscant and the scenes with Anakin and Padme in the droid factory being nothing else than fillers. But you know what? The same thing can be easily said about the giant worm trying to eat the Millennium Falcon in The Empire Strikes Back and the speeder bike chase on Endor in Return of the Jedi. :p 

To conclude about Attack of the Clones: I ended up liking it very well, maybe a little bit more than The Phantom Menace, which I still appreciated it. Who knows? And since this movie went up in my estimation and I no longer let myself be surrounded by all the negativity after having watched it for the second time, my rating certainly has gone up from what I've given previously.

I'll give Attack of the Clones a score of 8/10."
"Oct 29, 2015",2,"While there are glimmers of brilliance here, the movie doesn't feel like Star Wars. The acting is terrible, the story is terrible, the overload of CGI is terrible. This movie is..."
"Oct 28, 2015",1,Hayden Christensen is a pussy!
"Oct 27, 2015",2.5,"I do appreciate that they tried to make the characters more human and tried to bring some humor, even if they might not have always done great. Obi-Wan makes this film a lot more enjoyable to watch. In fact if Obi-Wan and Anakin's relationship was more of a focus I think that this would've been a stronger movie. However it's still Star Wars, and Star Wars is pretty chill."
"Oct 27, 2015",1,"I struggle to recall if i saw this in 2002. I seem to also remember that it was deemed marginally better than Phantom Menace. 

It's not. They may relegate Jar Jar, but it's still a stinker. Ooh Anakin Vader gets hormones and is sad for his Mummy. I hope Natalie Portman never forgave her agent."
"Oct 27, 2015",3,Its a decent/good movie!
"Oct 27, 2015",3,"What I like most:
1. The screenplay has improved much as compared to the previous installment
2. The chase scene with the Fetts and Obi-Wan through the astroids
3. Less Jar-Jar Binks
4. Much more interesting settings

What I dislike most:
1. Hayden Christiensen's acting"
"Oct 25, 2015",1.5,A remember this more favourably than actually watching it again. The use of CGI for basic scenes is awful and it feels like you are watching a computer game cut scene. Alongside that Annakin is portrayed as even more winey than when he was a young child. Whereas the previous film at least kept my attention longer this one I had to watch in 4 sittings!
"Oct 22, 2015",2,"By far the laziest of the entire franchise , with a forgettable story and a stupid script with horrible dialogue. The best part of the movie is Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee that at this point is not saying much !."
"Oct 21, 2015",3,"Better than the first one. Acting is still terrible and characters are boring, but the setpieces are awesome and the arena fight scene is jaw dropping."
"Oct 21, 2015",2.5,"Attack of the clones had a very promising premise, sadly in a lot of ways this film was more disappointing than the Phantom Menace due to the failure to execute that premise in a good way. The story is about an assassination attempt on senator Amidala and the investigation that comes from that. Them trying to find out who is behind it all could have been great, but instead we spend time watching a forced romance that does not work at all. the dialogue is torture at times and the final lightsaber fight was the worst one since A New Hope. Count Dooku was too old in my opinion, Christopher Lee was great don't get me wrong its just that a younger more violent sith apprentice would have been more interesting. The acting of Hayden and Natalie was not good. the gladiator arena battle was the highlight of the film and was the redeeming quality to this film. this is a slight step up from the Phantom Menace but still not a good Star wars movie. 2.6/5"
"Oct 20, 2015",3.5,"The second installment of this trilogy still never soars as high as the originals, but remains fitfully entertaining. Lucas' flaws from The Phantom Menace still remain, such as an undercooked screenplay and an overabundance of bluescreened backgrounds. And Christensen was clearly not the right choice for a character who is meant to display such emotion and internal conflict. This also makes his romance with Portman flat, especially since the writing for it is rather shallow. But it has a climax that delivers to the maximum, and seeing Yoda in full action is undoubtedly the biggest ""fanboy"" moment ever. Samuel L. Jackson's under-usage is unforgivable, but he (and his unique purple lightsaber) steal every scene that he is in. Christopher Lee's demeanor is also a great contribution, even though he has almost as little development as the previous film's villain. All in all, it is a fun blockbuster that makes an entertaining watch, even despite its narrative shortcomings."
"Oct 17, 2015",2,"I don't know what else to say about this movie. Attack of the Clones is slightly worse than The Phantom Menace. I could not care less about this film's plot, and the characters of this film, and there is an overuse of painfully obvious CGI. Most of the acting ranged from terrible to okay, with Hayden Christensen's acting being atrocious. However, there were a few things I liked. There were some action sequences I thought were entertaining, with the fight between Yoda and Count Dooku being a so bad it's awesome moment for me. The film is just as mediocre as its predecessor, and it is not close to being an entertaining film, it is boring."
"Oct 17, 2015",3.5,A Bit Better But Still Needs Improvement
"Oct 16, 2015",1,Nothing could be worse than the phantom menace
"Oct 12, 2015",3.5,Less Jar Jar is good. But still a bit too much awkward CGI.
"Oct 10, 2015",3,"This film benefits from better action sequences, stronger screenplay and dialogue. But the film it too long and still misses the wit of the original series."
"Oct 06, 2015",2.5,"Better than episode 1, but not by much"
"Oct 06, 2015",5,"This is a love story unlike any other, because it takes place in a galaxy far far away. If Episode I was just the beginning, Episode II was a great second act. One thing that makes it better because no one get frozen in carbonate this time and Christopher Lee gave a great performance as Count Doku and Temuera Morrison who we don't see much off these days was amazing as Jango Fett. You don't know what your missing if you don't see Attack of the Clones."
"Oct 05, 2015",3,Some good fights and its better than the phantom menace but that's not saying much
"Oct 02, 2015",2.5,"The worst Star Wars movie by far,Attack of the Clones is nothing but visual splendor with horrible dialogue."
"Sep 26, 2015",4,"Higher quality than Episode I, with more action, more fun, and much less Jar Jar Binks. The arena scene and the Battle of Geonosis was  very exciting."
"Sep 21, 2015",1,"Before there was Michael Bay to ruin your childhood, there was this movie. Hayden Christensen's acting is dreadful, whiny, and unhumorous. The Romantic sub-plot is unconvincing: what does a princess who led her people to victory see in a whiny teenage Jedi with emotional issues? That would be like Queen Elizabeth II dating Justin Bieber. 
What this film suffers from the most is the blockbuster syndrome: superb special effects, pathetic storytelling. Story is three things :Plot, Character, and Drama. Plot is tolerable at best, Character is robotic, and above all drama is missing. 
A pathetic fail to the legacy of a noble saga."
"Sep 14, 2015",0.5,By far the worst of the Star Wars movies
"Sep 12, 2015",1,I was waiting for something to happen and then the credits rolled.
"Sep 12, 2015",2,"Attack of the Clones is the longest film in the series at 2 hours 22 minutes, and is very drawn out and boring.  It is better than its predecessor, but that isn't saying much.  What once was one of the best series is dragged down by their prequels."
"Sep 11, 2015",1,"This one on the other hand, is about as bad as I'd heard.  So baselessly self-important.  Even the special effects appear to've gone downhill since the previous.  About the only half-decent thing about it are its few, ever-so subtle, primitive, yet somewhat-accurate winks at contemporary US politics."
"Sep 08, 2015",5,"A brilliant piece of cinema, if it wasn't for the masterful direction, the film would still be brilliant. I particularly praise the acting from Mr Hayden Christensen, he made this movie what it was, a masterpiece."
"Sep 07, 2015",0.5,You thought it couldn't get worse!! This is absolutely outrageously horrible
"Sep 06, 2015",3.5,"A slow moving film at times but then it moves fast with a few awesome action scenes, but then it leads to an epic large scale battle on Geonosis! We finally see the beginning of the clone wars, that Obi-Wan And Leia we’re referring to in A new hope. It’s great to finally see Ewan MacGregor become the Mentor Obi-wan, while Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker, moves closer toward his dark destiny. Also, Yoda is da man, and you gotta love Mace windu and his Purple Lightsaber!!"
"Sep 05, 2015",3,"This was a mess, That whole love story was totally a snoozefest, Christiansen can't act, and the only time it's interesting is when someone is shooting at something."
"Sep 05, 2015",2.5,"Not many True Blue Star Wars fans hold this film very highly and there is a good reason: Hayden Christensen, Tacky Romance &amp; complete over use of CGI.

The only few scenes that where interesting was Obi Wan Kenobi's travel to the Kimino planet. It's just a frustrating film.

It's very uneven &amp; just really looses the magic of what makes Star Wars so great. Often appeals to the female fans of Star Wars but I always find it a struggle to sit through."
"Sep 02, 2015",3.5,7/10 Not that bad considerig it is a prequel...enjoyed the end Jedi battle.
"Aug 29, 2015",4,"I enjoyed this film.  Like all the Star Wars films it has major flaws, but this was really entertaining."
"Aug 28, 2015",2.5,Not the best movie ever but a lot better than The Phantom Menace
"Aug 25, 2015",1,"Just as The Phantom Menace turned Star Wars into a boring political drama, Attack of the Clones turned it into an even more boring romance story. The writing somehow got even worse, with the politics talk replaced with unbearable romance dialogue, featuring such gems like ""I wish I could just wish away my feelings"". The Phantom Menace gets a lot of (well deserved) flack, and this movie doesn't get enough."
"Aug 23, 2015",1.5,"AWFUL dialogue, forced love story, too much cgi, Dooku fight at the end that destroys Yoda's character, and also a lot of stuff that doesn't really matter, in order to get an army of clones, but does lead to Obi-Wan playing an interesting game of clue."
"Aug 23, 2015",3,"Lots of CGI...fake sets lead to dull dialogue. Story-wise this is the real beginning of Anakin's journey, and we get some great insight into the early darkness of Vader."
"Aug 22, 2015",2.5,"It's tense, visually stylish, and it gradually becomes more of what its series title expects of it; but it's sadly still badly acted, occasionally improbable, and horrifically sour on the writing."
"Aug 22, 2015",2,"If not for the absolutely childish cheesy an unnecessary love story it would be ok. With that it's rather annoying. But still, it's Star Wars, so can't say I hate it."
"Aug 21, 2015",0.5,"I don't like Attack of the Clones. It's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets about everything wrong."
"Aug 21, 2015",3,"the end of the movie, where the clones finally charge into battle with the CIS and the entire Jedi army joins the fight was absolutely great! I love the clone/stormtroopers! But i admit that the biggest part of the movie is average or sometimes even lame, epecially the Anakin and Padmé scenes suck, better writing (and acting) was needed in this movie. Still decent though.

Hayden Christensen also sucks balls in the night for his incredibly bad performance, minus one star simply because of him."
"Aug 20, 2015",1.5,Star Wars Attack of the Clones is the worst thing made by a human...except for the bagpipes
"Aug 16, 2015",2.5,Not much happens besides boring romance.
"Aug 14, 2015",4,Star Wars:Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a fairly good follow-up to The Phantom Menace. It has a good combination of sci/fi-thriller and the visuals are better in this one.
"Aug 14, 2015",2.5,despite the dumb dialogues between anakin and padme and the awfull CGI it'splot is better than the phantom manace due to the begining of the war of the clones and the kickass battle at the end.However the actings of Natalie Portman and Hyden Christensen were disgusting.The special effects were great but in the end this movie is more special effects tha a deep story which the original trilogy had.
"Aug 10, 2015",2.5,THIS MOVIE IS SO BORING THAT I COULDN'T EVEN KEEP WATCHING UNTIL THE ACTION BEGINS.
"Aug 10, 2015",3,"Good action, terrible acting"
"Aug 06, 2015",1.5,"Oh dear, Star Wars continues to get mullered in these prequels.  Finally getting in gear towards the end of the film, perhaps too late to turn around the mess that went beforehand."
"Aug 05, 2015",1.5,"So to start off I want to say this film is no improvement over the last. It's actually worse, surprisingly. Anakin is as annoying as ever, and Jar Jar is as annoying as Heck, everyone is depressed, and this movie is no fun at all. There isn't much to say about this film, it's just the death of the Star Wars series. All I can do is hope the next one will be good."
"Aug 03, 2015",5,Wall to wall action at the end the Yoda seen is amazing
"Aug 03, 2015",3.5,The worst of all but still watchable and has very good moments and is part of the saga
"Aug 01, 2015",3,An improve version of the first one. and more entertaining. However. still lacks attention to detail and a well written story line.
"Jul 28, 2015",3,"5th best installment of the 6 Star Wars films.

Grade = 6/10"
"Jul 27, 2015",5,good starwars movie a great begging of the end
"Jul 27, 2015",2.5,"Better than its predecessor and better than I remembered, though still suffering from wooden, lackluster performances not helped by Lucas' direction."
"Jul 24, 2015",1.5,The film that preceded this film was just as bad as this one.
"Jul 24, 2015",4,This was slower and with very dense characteristics. but engeneral STAR WARS is entertaining
"Jul 21, 2015",2,"Although some parts are better than the first, the absolute worst part is the forced romance, which is the most cringe worthy moments in film history."
"Jul 17, 2015",2.5,"Do to the lack of Jar-Jar Binks, an improvement is made, but it is a cringe fest do its poor scripting and perhaps not the best casting for Anakin Skywalker whom comes off as whiny."
"Jul 16, 2015",3,It was good better then 1 for sure
"Jul 13, 2015",1.5,Not bad but not good
"Jul 09, 2015",4,This second installment in the prequel franchise might've improved well even though it's kinda heavily flawed!
"Jul 06, 2015",3.5,Poor character developing but great effects.
"Jul 05, 2015",3,"Hayden Christensen's performance is cringeworthy along with Portman. The romance scenes drag on too long. Some great action sequences coupled with spectacular effects are the redeeming qualities. Another worthy performance from McCregor as well. Overall much better than Episode I, but still needs that fantastic charm and writing from the originals."
"Jul 03, 2015",3.5,"So much better than TPM, still a bit pedestrian in places. However makes more sense and the action sequences are excellent, still wish Jar Jar Binks got vaporised. Christopher Lee, legend!"
"Jun 30, 2015",3.5,"George Lucas' Attack of the Clones is a slight improvement over Phantom Menace but still suffers from poor character development and interaction.
     The movie cuts down on some of the endless exposition found in Phantom but still has a bit too much. The set pieces are extremely good and the battle scenes remind you of the original trilogy and are in and of themselves wonderful. In general the Force is more alive in this movie than in the previous one.
     The two biggest problems with the movie are still the screenplay and Anakin's story. The screenplay in general is poor. Characters deliver dialogue at strange times with unintentionally awkward pauses. Anakin's story is also poor which really damages a movie that has his and Padme's relationship as one of its central motifs. Their relationship just feels a bit unbelievable. Their love isn't developed in a way that should end in a marriage which is where the movie does end. Anakin is also portrayed as a sort of baby throughout the whole movie. While his childish emotions make a credible path to the dark side his immaturity makes the audience actually not like Anakin. His journey to the dark side could have been full of relatable failures and shortcomings. His journey could have taken us on a path where we can really see the dark side of emotions and attachments. Instead, we just want to yell, ""GROW UP"". 
     While the movie is still enjoyable the poor Anakin storyline really hampers a movie that otherwise would be a very worthy prequel to the original trilogy. I give it a 3.5/5."
"Jun 30, 2015",2.5,"Still a trainwreck of a movie, as Lucas hardly improved his efforts. The acting is below par, with only Mcgregor and Lee doing any spectacular work. Yes, it is an improvement over PM, but only slightly."
"Jun 28, 2015",5,Second best of the prequels. THE best being Episode III.
"Jun 28, 2015",3.5,"Terrible love story. Slightly better acting, worser dialogue. Great action scenes. Overall a better movie."
"Jun 26, 2015",2,Better than the first prequel but still sorely lacking in any sense of story.
"Jun 25, 2015",1,"Utter tosh, what is Lucas thinking?  What is McGregor doing?  What is Portman doing? Why is Christensen even in this film!?  Total destruction of the myth."
"Jun 23, 2015",2,"This is worse than Phantom Menace. The acting sucks. It has a cool story though. In the Phantom Menace, they TRIED to make a good movie. This film didn't even try."
"Jun 23, 2015",2.5,"Tell me Lucas didn't make it. Please. Phantom Menace was bad enough without having this. But loyalty dies hard.
Don't bother, unless you are a Star Wars fan."
"Jun 21, 2015",0.5,"This movies just pretty awkward to watch thanks to Hayden Christiensen, it's just pretty bad."
"Jun 17, 2015",2.5,"Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones.

About the clones and how they get me bad. This is a really generic 5th installment of the series. And get me wrong, I'm a Star Wars fan! I have been since I was 3 years old. But I thought the action and acting was good. But barely a passing grade

"Jun 11, 2015",3,"I thought this Star Wars movie was much better then the disappointing ""Phantom Menace"" we received three years before this film was released. I thought this one had better action sequences and had a better story. It also had some pretty cool new characters as well as good special effects. However, I didn't like that they threw in some more crumby dialogue like the last one. I also wasn't huge on the romance story in this one either. It felt a little forced into the movie. Other then that though, I don't have any major issues with this movie. Decent enough Star Wars movie that fans will enjoy."

"Jun 11, 2015",2.5,Hayden Christensen's acting is bland and boring. The dialogue was pointless and didn't seem to progress the story in any way. This movie's silver lining had to have been the action scenes which didn't disappoint.
"Jun 09, 2015",1,"""I don't like sand --- it's coarse and rough and irritating...and it gets everywhere! Not like here. Here, everything is soft...and smooth."""
"Jun 09, 2015",2,"a cluster f--k of cgi with incoherent reactions from the chracters and failed dull romance and is riddled with implausible situations and the name doesn't even work ""attack of the clones"" it's like if you named ""return of the jedi"" ""the battle of endor"". there has been so much things that have been already said about episode 2 so if I were to describe it in one sentence it would be ""George Lucas's wet incoherent cgi dream"""
"Jun 07, 2015",4,"In alot of ways, This is a much better film than ""The Phantom Menace"". In some ways, This is my least favorite out of all the Star Wars films. And yes, Its because of one thing. The love story is.....sigh. Bad. I know. I know. Look, I love Star Wars. I adore it. So it pains me to admit. The love story is bad. At least in this movie it is. The dialogue is painful and the 2 actors have hardy any chemistry. Hayden Christensen is just not a good actor. Its funny, Aside from that, This movie is awesome. You got a good mystery surrounding the plot. Ewan McGregor is fantastic. The action is great. Much of the effects still hold up. The addition of Christopher Lee is most welcome and it made for one of the saga's best villains, and I still applaud when Yoda whips out that lightsaber. Just an awesome image. It shows, Even at it's weakest. Star Wars is still better than most franchises who desperately wanna be like it."
"Jun 03, 2015",3.5,If you can get past the stupid dialog and the cringe worthy love scenes it's actually a pretty good movie
"Jun 03, 2015",4,"My memory did not fail me, it improves from the last film from the first frame to the last. I was thinking, should I rate this 4 stars for my blog, then flashed by in my head all at once, badass yoda fighting Count Dracula! Obi-Wan fighting Boba-Fett's dad, better effects, epic Jedi vs an Army battle, yeah I can give it some sympathy rating.

I don't completely understand the politics of the film, but I have an average IQ to understand what they are on about half the time. The action is revamped, the special effect are still exploited, twice as much as a matter of fact. Somehow it look's a hell'uva lot better. Hayden Christenson who plays a few grow-spouts older Anakin Skywalker, speaks like somebody has his testicles in a vise, every time he speaks they tighten it. I don't know if that was a performance choose, but it definitely didn't work. The role did suite him well, it was just hard to actually like him, which is fundamental to understand how he becomes, who he becomes.
Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) brings that humor Lucas could not capture in the failure that was Episode 1. McGregor takes over the film easily from Liam Neeson's departure, which is no surprise with a supporting cast that don't have a clue what they are doing with there roles.

The peaceful alliance of the galaxy in Phantom Menace, ten years ago, has fallen apart because of a treaty created by Count Dooku, played by legendary Hammer horror Dracula, Christopher Lee- who gets an awesome showdown with Yoda (Frank Oz) at the end- one of the reasons I give this film a slight-overrating. The Queen and Senator Padme are trying to gain the vote to give the Republic an army to protect themselves from the collapse of over seven-thousand Galactic empires, who are leaving the council. The Queen get's assassinated, that drive's the need for the vote for a Republic Army even more. Anakin takes Padme to her planet of Naboo, while Obi-Won investigates a Galaxy system that is not in the Jedi archives. What will he find? The Clones, just what the republic needed. But whom knew they needed such a mighty army?!


Everyone likes giving George Lucas shit, he screwed up. But once and a while you need to sit back and look at in awe of what come out of his imagination. A whole spectrum of worlds, not just planetary or galactic worlds a massive-undying fictional Multi-Verse. why I choose this Star Wars film to give him credit for what he has created, I don't know, but that's what I felt while watching a lot better sequel-prequel. I cant help but feel bad, that Disney is no longer following his outlines he drawn for them to use in the new film with the contract to sell the saga to them.

Anakin is a moody little baby-bitch, granted. But he nails it in that scene with Padme were he talks about killing the woman and children of the sand-camp. His poor dialogue is suppressed like a silencer on a faulty-Uzi after that scene, really saves the actor a littl from fans or reviewers like me to pin the blame on the un-natural enjoyment of his performance.

Fact is, be it time or skills there is and always will be something missing from these prequels, that were so present in the originals. Be it characters like Han-Solo or Luke- whatever it is, it's only touched in this film, never grasped or captured. If the characters stopped talking in the middle of the great action scene's and let it talk for itself or no cutting away from one good scene to a bad one frequently, if only. A better look at a great set of films, that are really bad."

"May 25, 2015",2,"Star Wars episode 2 the attack of the clones review:
The original cast went south as they changed. Hayden Christiansen was horrible. The chemistry between him and Natalie Portman is awful. Obi-wan is good but the cgi is used on too many characters. There are some really good scenes that are ruined by bad script and acting. 4 out of 10"
"May 23, 2015",2.5,"Better than the first, but not by a whole lot."
"May 23, 2015",2.5,"Hayden Christensen ruined the dearth baser I love, he made anakin a creep and totally ruined the movie, obi wan was great, I actually tolerated Jar-Jar, I hate Jar-Jar, but I hate anakin in this one."
"May 23, 2015",2.5,"This installment is an improvement over its horrific predecessor, but sadly it turns out to be a highly disappointing mediocre movie, with dialogue that is absolute trash, no exciting duels, and actors who makes his or her character crap. There are some positives in this movie like new cool villains, colorful background and effects, the Geonosis battle, the backstory of the stormtroopers and even the stormtroopers back then, and some others. Still this movie isn't that impressive or great at all."
"May 23, 2015",4,"A significant step-up from the previous episode, Episode 2 is a good yet flawed film much like Episode 1. Does have a long run time but it further develops characters, and starts to lead the prequels to their final chapter."
"May 22, 2015",3.5,"Actually quite solid if you ignore, or better yet, skip past, the romance scenes that never seem to end. Quite a lot of things going on here."
"May 20, 2015",2.5,"This sequel-prequel was better than Episode 1: Phantom Menace but not by a lot. There's so much boring dialogue. Obi-Wan and Anakin's relationship is very dull that it doesn't look like they are actually friends. Anakin and Padme's relationship was not good in here. Showing Boba Fett as a kid was really awkward. The action scenes in this movie are great and fun to watch. 
The scene where Jango hires an assassin to kill Padme backfires that it's so laughable. The assassin hires a droid to kill Padme with poisonous worms. Why not a rocket through the window?! Or a gun!? So laughable! 
Overall, so many flaws, but pretty decent."
"May 19, 2015",3,Terrible. Just as mediocre as the Ep 1 if not worse.
"May 17, 2015",1,"""I hate sand. It's coarse, it's itchy and it gets everywhere."" Well, Anakin, that's interesting because your character is coarse and whiny and you manage to get everywhere on my last nerve. But hey, that just means Anakin's personality is consistent with time and two different actors. Bravo. Five stars. Just kidding, I hate this movie."
"May 16, 2015",4.5,"This is the only Star Wars film that I would complain about...its script and acting are very cliched and stale, but the visuals and action sequences are top notch."
"May 14, 2015",3,"Attack of the Clones has great action sequences and amazing plot, and while I couldn't quite understand whose side the Clones were on, the film does have great acting and great character development. AOTC does have a bit of parts that I did fall asleep on, but overall, the film is good.

       Yoda, who is my favorite character in the whole saga played an amazing part, where he saved the day in the end.

       I don't have much to say about the film, but AOTC is a huge improvement over The Phantom Menace. 

GRADE: 6/10"
"May 13, 2015",2,40% on my Tomatometer.
"May 11, 2015",0.5,This is the worst film ever made
"May 10, 2015",2,"Poor acting (besides McGregor), an even worse story, atrocious dialogue (""I don't like sand..""), and a very bad ""romance"". Not even less Jar Jar could've saved it, which is saying a lot."
"May 08, 2015",0.5,"This has some of the poorest acting, a terrible love story and some stupid continuity errors"
"May 08, 2015",4,"Great = 4/5

""Attack of the Clones"" is by far considered the worst Star Wars film yet. well, according to popular public opinion at least. I, however, still enjoy the film to this day, and I personally believe it was even better than its predecessor - ""The Phantom Menace""."
"May 06, 2015",4.5,Lots of action.  moves quickly.  Yoda fighting is hilarious.
"May 05, 2015",1.5,"Like The Phantom Menace, we're presented with a visually stunning movie that offers nothing from the rest of its parts to provide meaning to its setting. The plot itself is full of holes that are widened by boring dialogue and terrible characters. The love story is shockingly vapid because there's no reason presented on-screen for why Padme should be in love with Anakin, who just comes off as a creepy psycho for the majority of the movie. When my own mother is yawning during the romance scenes and asking for laser battles in space, you have officially lost your audience."
"May 04, 2015",3,"While still suffering from inconsistencies and the poor casting of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, Attack of the clones has enough impressive action and high energy (especially in the second act), to make an improvement over Phantom menace"
"May 04, 2015",4,"Better sequel, almost everything is CGI now aside from the actors."
"May 03, 2015",2,"Possibly the worst of the Star Wars films to date, Attack of the Clones forces many of the plot moving devices required for the original movies to take place. This force (get it?) is due, in part, to the aggressive, rough progression of a relationship between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman."
"May 02, 2015",1.5,"The worst Star Wars movie. Almost nothing redeems it, except some funny scenes by Ewan Mcgregor, the best thing in the prequels. Yoda's light saber battle is fun for a split second, but then looks stupid."
"Apr 30, 2015",3.5,"In my opinion this movie gets more hate than it deserves.  The action sequences in the movie I thought were some of the coolest I have ever seen.  I think this episode did what it was supposed to in showing Anikin's dark side.  One flawed performance was Heyden's,  it seemed like he tried too hard.  I didn't buy him as young Darth Vader."
"Apr 26, 2015",2.5,"Lots of CGI and action.
A fresh rating of 66%.
   ""An improvement over Phantom Menace, though only due to its upped action."""
"Apr 26, 2015",2.5,"worst in the series, that's all that needs to be said!"
"Apr 25, 2015",3,This movie is a 50-50 movie. Obi Wan's side of the film is awesome and classic Star Wars.......let's just not talk about the other half....
"Apr 23, 2015",2,"The exposition is redundant, dampering the emotion. The acting cannon continues to be wooden and screenplay is sloppy. Nevertheless, Star Wars Episode II saving grace is they have a well choreographed fight sequence."
"Apr 22, 2015",2,I found this film to be so bad the Jar Jar Binks scene was actually one of my favourite parts.
"Apr 21, 2015",2,"The weakest link in the star wars saga, mostly due to stiff acting and a lack of chemistry."
"Apr 19, 2015",4,Is better than the last one
"Apr 18, 2015",4,I've got the higher ground
"Apr 17, 2015",2.5,The awkwardness between Padme and Anakin is easily forgivable if you just pretend they are nervous. The acting isn't actually as bad as people make it out to be but it still wasn't that good of a movie. Probably the weakest film in the Star Wars saga.
"Apr 14, 2015",3,From my blog Foster as Films: https://fosterasfilms.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/foster-as-star-wars-episode-ii-attack-of-the-clones/
"Apr 13, 2015",2.5,"While the weakest of the bunch, attack of the clones serves to be a highly entertaining film (the last 45 minutes). Other than that, the romance is forced, the dialogue is weak, and it's awkwardly paced."
"Apr 11, 2015",0.5,A true wooden performance handed in by all.
"Apr 07, 2015",1.5,this is another horrible movie! every character sucks! so many plot holes and its a huge mess but the battles are good (the climax battle is really good!!) but this is another one you can force away.
"Apr 06, 2015",1,"Least favorite in the series. The dialog is horrible and, to quote honest trailers, the romance was as soulless as the computer it was made in."
"Mar 30, 2015",3.5,"Es ligeramente mejor que su antecesora, mejora algunos aspectos y otro los empeora. El problema recae al exceso de la subtrama romanticismo sin chispa entre Natalie y Hayden llegando a ser algo forzado su relacion, dialogos algo cursis. Se agardece que hayan minimizado el enfoque de otros los personajes que no aportaban anda interesante (Jar Jar Binks). Aun con los serios problemas que posee la cinta, llega a ser entretenida por la gran mejora de las escenas de accion, el suspenso que trae la historia y en cierta parte el desarollo que le dan las motivaciones del futuro Darth Vader."
"Mar 28, 2015",3.5,It has some cool visuals and actions sequences and in my opinion is a better movie than Phantom Menace but the dialogue is pretty awful. Portman and Christensen are probably the worst on-screen couple in the history of cinema It's a shame that I didn't grow up with the original Star wars but than again I grew up with the greatest trilogy of all time Lord of the Rings. I watched Phantom menace with my father and I saw this one with my friends when I was young and I'll always treasure those experiences.
"Mar 23, 2015",3.5,"Well, this is an improvement over 'The Phantom Menace', showing that George Lucas may have potential with the 'Prequel Trilogy'. However, while the action sequences are fantastic, with the finale being fantastic, the focus on romance drags and distracts from what a 'Star Wars' film should be."
"Mar 23, 2015",4.5,"A fun as hell movie with great action sequences and an interesting story, but some godawful acting is in the mix. Props to Ewan McGregor, who captures a young Obi-Wan perfectly, Samuel L. Jackson, Ian McDermid, Christopher Lee, and Frank Oz, but Hayden Christiansen is as stale as an ancient piece of cardboard. Oh, and Jango Fett is cool. 9 out of 10 GREAT"
"Mar 22, 2015",3.5,"good but not the best star wars movie ever is like the black sheep of star wars franchise but it has his good ones, but i didnt like the personality of anakin he is a fucking perversed stalker of padme and WTF is the fact of 40 percent of the movie are burocratic conversations that no one cares about like ""fuck all that talk just show the lightsaber fights"" its definitly a good/bad movie its good and bad at the same time but fuck it its a star wars movie"
"Mar 13, 2015",3,Yoda fighting was good
"Mar 11, 2015",3.5,"Better than Phantom Menace, but did it need to be made?"
"Mar 10, 2015",1,the only star wars movie I fell asleep watching.....dull and overly shite!
"Mar 07, 2015",3,Algo tiene el ataque de los clones que me sigue encantando y a pesar de esa burda relacion romantica es de mis favoritas.
"Mar 07, 2015",5,Great prequel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Mar 01, 2015",3,"Neat creatures, but the acting skills were questionable..."
"Feb 21, 2015",3.5,"Better than its predecessor for sure, but still has poor dialogue with mediocre acting.  Add some of the very solid action sequences."
"Feb 14, 2015",3,Great action! Ok story kind of slow like phantom menace! Hayden Christian needs acting lessons!
"Feb 09, 2015",3.5,"Decently progresses the storyline.  Good visuals, well paced."
"Feb 09, 2015",2,"Very boring, and Hayden Christensen seems like he was having a very hard time portraying Anakin Skywalker."
"Feb 08, 2015",2,"My least favorite Star Wars film. The love story is horribly awkward and creepy, and it makes no sense. The computer effects look very dated. Just like the Phantom Menace, there’s a huge battle at the end, and just like in that movie, I’m just wanting the movie to end at that point."
"Feb 07, 2015",3,"The movie has its moments, but I'd be lying if I said the whole thing doesn't feel hackneyed.  The climax, where we see Yoda finally unleash his full Jedi awesome-ness, is the high point.  The rest is beautiful to look at, but, ultimately, stale.  Extra points are awarded for the first real scene of Vader rage."
"Feb 06, 2015",3,"Somewhat better than the childish first of the ""new trilogy"" but still should've never been made."
"Jan 31, 2015",3,"The wife is out and daughter is doing her own thing, so Jnr and I took the opportunity to move on to Episode II of the saga as we prepare ourselves for The Force Awakens in December.
It's been quite a while since I've seen Attack of the Clones (First time since I got the Blu Ray box set) and I don't feel HD has done it any favours as the pin sharp picture shows up the artificiality of the CGI world we now inhabit. 
Generally, cast-wise, the film is solid apart from Hayden Christensen's petulant teenager Anakin. If he'd just been sent to his room or had his Playstation taken off him more often then the path of galactic history may have been completely different! 
The love story between Anakin and Padme is necessary and is okay as far as it goes. The political background required to build up to the galactic civil war, yeh,can live with that too. 
Yet, when we finally get to see what we really want, which is a lot of Jedi (including Sam Jackson's Mace Windu) going medieval on some droids asses, it's all looking rather dull. No offence to the multivarious Jedi cast members, but most of them barely seem to know how to swing a light sabre. During the time period that gave us Helm's Deep the start of the Clone Wars was such a non-event. 
On the bright side we do get Yoda kicking Dooku's proverbial...
It probably gets an extra star because it's a Star Wars film...
*sigh*"
"Jan 30, 2015",3,Unfortunately not so good.
"Jan 28, 2015",2,"The film responsible for some of the franchise's worst dialogue, it still has its moments. Full review later."
"Jan 28, 2015",3,"The worst of the new trilogy. The older I grow the more I hate Hayden Christensen. But still, you know, epic lightsaber battles."
"Jan 23, 2015",3,It's always fun to go back to a galaxy far far away but this is definitely the worst of the bunch. A great appearance by yoda towards the end is the only thing of note.
"Jan 20, 2015",3,"La mÃ s romÃ ntica de toda la serie, excelentes efectos especiales."
"Jan 18, 2015",2,"A bit better than Episode 1, still not that good"
"Jan 14, 2015",3,"While the special effects are outstanding, and the mythos is expanded more, this Star Wars film still suffers from wooden acting, too much exposition and a horrible scrip"
"Jan 12, 2015",0.5,This was worse than the Phantom Menace. I wish zero stars was an option because this movie deserves a rating of zero. Fuck you George Lucas Kill Yourself
"Jan 12, 2015",0.5,"Boring, has Jar-Jar, and has a winy Anakin."
"Jan 08, 2015",2.5,"So after the shock therapy of millions of butthurt fans from 'The Phantom Menace', it looked like Star Wars Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones had its chance of improving after Phantom Menace. Hayden Christensen (who at the time was a pretty good actor at his time,) replaced Jake Lloyd, the stormtroopers looked to have a origin, Jar Jar was to be cut down from the film, and even ""Boba Fett"" made an appearance. So after a rewatch of this film and the PT, did it improve from episode one? *Sigh* Barely. So again, as a fellow Star Wars fanatic and even a fan of the Clone War shows, this review is just a subjective opinion. But anyways, while the effects are i guess better detailed when presenting the large scale cities, some wit and humor FINALLY comes back (even if 90% is forced.), Ewan Mcgregor gets some personality with Obi-Wan's character, and some ideas and cool star wars stuff do appear, ...... yeah everything else fails. Attack of the Clones in general suffers from WAY too much exposition (mostly from sitting and talking,) has the most forceful and uncharismatic romance between two characters i've seen since Romeo &amp; Juliet, the CGI, regardless of models used later on in post-production, make the environments the actors are in fake as hell, the odd and weird homage to Empire fails in every way possible, many odd character changes or fights (EX: Yoda flipping around &amp; overabundance of lightsaber fights,) and also the acting of Hayden Christensen playing Anakin Skywalker later turned into the evil Darth Vader, while ironically tries to capture the annoying brat part of Luke Skywalker, it basically fills up 89% of his character instead. Personally overall, SLIGHTLY better but still the worst of the series."
"Jan 07, 2015",4,"Only Star Wars I saw in theaters, so it holds a place in my heart. The romance could've been stronger and there's the usual silly dialogue and an awkward turn from Hayden Christensen, but heck, good lightsaber battles and other great action scenes, it's an entertaining movie. I'd go so far as to say that the negative ideas towards it are without merit and even somewhat bizarre. The action is fantastic and the final 45 minutes are a fun ride."
"Jan 04, 2015",1,I give up with watching this crap!
"Jan 02, 2015",1,"This movie consists of actors standing in front of a green screen for 95% of the movie, need I say more?"
"Jan 01, 2015",4,love me a political drama. even better when it's in space
"Dec 31, 2014",1,"""It's all Obi Wans fault! He's jealous, he doesn't understand! Waah, waaah!"" Oh, for Gods sake Hayden, SHUT THE HELL UP YOU LITTLE CRYBABY!! Dear George, this was not Anakin Skywalker from the original trilogy. What were you thinking!? Oh that's right, you didn't think, you suck at writing! Expectations for ""The Force Awakens"" are high, and it better not disappoint! As for this one, don't waste your time!"
"Dec 30, 2014",3,"Review In A Nutshell:

After the disappointment that was The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones redeems the trilogy with a decent entry that delivers more character development and a simplistic storyline. The film is a balanced screenplay that juggles back and forth between the romance of Anakin and Padme - which also covers the deeper development of Anakin and explores more of how he became who we expect him to be, while the other covers a larger story of internal corruption and cultural genocide.

The film holds its ground fairly well with its two storylines, ensuring accessibility and entertainment, but it is still far from the amazing efforts brought by the original trilogy. The romance of the film may be essential to the subsequent entries of the saga but it is heavily sentimental and manipulative, paired with an at times cringing performance by Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker. 

Both storylines eventually converge into a climax that rivals the one shown on the Phantom Menace, elevating the scope of the battle and displaying the peak of computer generated imagery at the time. It also features a great duel between Count Dooku, but sadly he wasn't as compelling or as graceful as Darth Maul from the previous film.

Attack of the Clones brings the prequel trilogy back on a positive track, correcting many of the mistakes that were found in the previous film. I hope the upward trend continuous onto the next film."

"Dec 25, 2014",0.5,This is truly an abomination on film.
"Dec 25, 2014",1.5,Only a bit more to be had from this one that Episode 1. The Clone Wars animated series has far more body and soul than this.
"Dec 24, 2014",3.5,"Continuing ten years after The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones is an fair enough follow up. Certainly more action this time around and a romance blloms between Anakin and Padme. The actors do well enough in their parts and everything seems to fit nicely. Showing the start of the Clone Wars which would lead The evil Palpatine to power is done well."
"Dec 23, 2014",3,"While it is one of the more action-packed films out of the series, Attack of the Clones is still the weakest of the Star Wars saga. Yet, despite its flaws, Lucas delves deeper into the conflict that would eventually bring about the Republic's fall and concludes the film with a satisfying, 40-minute long third-act that sets things up for darker events to come in what would be the best of the prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith.

"Dec 22, 2014",2,"It's very close between Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, but the lack of Binks and abundance of action makes it marginally better. However, It loses the entire essence of what Star Wars was supposed to be about with eye-burning CGI, most inexcusably evident in the freak-fest planet of Coruscant. Christensen is not as bad as everyone says he is; he is at least convincing at portraying Anakin's raw anger and frustration. One of the film's major issues is its failure to decide upon a leading protagonist, causing us to be catapulted to and fro between the boring dialogue between Padme and Anakin and Ewan Mcgregor attempting to act next to entirely computerised figures."
"Dec 19, 2014",3.5,Once the film kicks into high gear we finally see glimpses of the Star Wars we all have come to know and love!
"Dec 16, 2014",2.5,"Improved upon the first one with amazing CGI effects and action scenes, the second entry in the Star Wars prequel gave what fans have waited for as a Star Wars film but quite frankly suffers due to a miscast protaganist, terrible dialogue between its love couple and a misleading title to the movie."

"Dec 06, 2014",3.5,"George Lucas seems to enjoy casting bad actors. Hayden Christensen's acting skills are exceeded by R2-D2. Unlike Nicholas Cage, we do not laugh with him, we laugh at him. 

George Lucas relies on CGI too much in the 5th installment in the Star Wars series, and it hurts him. At the films climax, when the heroes are threatened with impalement, evisceration and other fun ways to die, we laugh. We laugh, because the monsters, who would dare to harm our beloved Jedi, look about as real as a Narnian dictionary. I would have preferred the puppets used in the original series. Although, I would not wish to see the blue colored, keyboard thumping, elephantish creature, from Max Rebo's band. 

This film is much more intelligent than its prequel. The political aspect of it is engaging. It feels realish.

Why does Padmè like Anakin. He is stupid, immature, and about ten years younger than her! That's all I have to say about that.

After the Deus Ex Machina, Yoda, arrives, to save the heroes from an early death, at the climax. Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobi pursue Christopher Lee's Count Dracula Dooku. If they do not catch him, he will do more bad things. Annie and Obi need not worry about all of the battle droids who are killing the other Jedi. Dooku hurts Obi Wan (he doesn't kill him, because this movie is rated PG), and Anakin is left to save the day. Unfortunately, Anakin's arm gets chopped off, and Dooku kills both of them. KIDDING! Yoda comes in and saves them, just before Dooku can slay them. Somehow, Dooku escapes and lives to swash his buckle another day. This part of the film feels ill conceived. The lightsaber duel/brawl is anticlimactic (where is Darth Maul?). A particularly lazy move was letting Yoda prance in and save them. He's already done that! Why do they get to play that card twice?

The film ends with Anakin and Padmè tying the knot. 
Roll credits! 
Directed by The Force. 
Produced by Walt Disney

Overall, the film improves on its predecessor. I regret the casting of Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Still, he did better than Jake Lloyd who got the role because Daniel Radcliffe was busy.
Han shot first!"
"Dec 04, 2014",2,It bores even when there is action in screen and it's awful dialogue will make you cringe.
"Dec 04, 2014",2.5,"A small improvement over Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones is fortunentely a bit more focused on its storytelling, even if it's not a really great story to begin with. Some action set pieces are fun and well realized but there's just way too many cringe moments and silly things to make this barely tolerable. Add an unbearable romance and the worse actor imaginable for a young Vader and the Force is completely gone on Lucas on this one."
"Nov 29, 2014",1,This movie wears the crown of worst Star Wars movie ever made. 
"Nov 28, 2014",2,"It is better than Phantom Menace, but still not worth watching. Maybe some hardcore fans liked it, but I didn't."
"Nov 17, 2014",2.5,"Everything has gotten a bit better from Episode 1, and I'd say Attack of the Clones is a worthy popcorn flick. 53/100"
"Nov 14, 2014",2.5,"too long with stiff performances and wooden dialogue, it retains some of the Star Wars charm thanks to CP3O"
"Nov 11, 2014",2.5,"I hate Attack of the Clones, it's coarse, rough and IT GETS ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!"
"Oct 30, 2014",3.5,"Continuation of the prequel trilogy, Attack of the Clones sees teenager Anakin Skywalker in action. Better than the 'Menacing' that came before, this prequel makes the basis for Revenge of the Sith. Set mostly in dry and arid worlds, it can soon become little too torrid for the viewers."
"Oct 29, 2014",4.5,The second in the prequel trilogy suffers from a few awkward moments but otherwise provides a great adventure with stunning visuals and a fascinating story with plenty of action to get you thrilled for the next installment.

"Oct 09, 2014",4,"I am a fan of the  Star Wars  series, but even I was disappointed in The Phantom Menace.  With many of the industry's well-known critics slamming this movie, my expectations began to lower.  Yes, I was still excited, but I was preparing myself for another flop-ola.  So what happened?  I'll tell you what happened.  I saw a film that brought back the magic of the first trilogy.  I saw a film that never had a dull moment in its 2:30+ in duration.  Do you have to be a  Star Wars fan to enjoy this movie as much as I did?  Maybe, because I cannot understand what these other critics missed.  So instead of spoiling the movie by giving away all its twists and turns, this review is for those who saw it, liked it and are confused.  This review will be a comparison of reviews from other critics to help give the reader a perspective of the ""type"" of person (in the best way possible) who did not like this movie.

Before we get to the critics, let me make one short statement.  Movie critics were not prevalent, as they are now, in 1977 when the first A New Hope  was released.  Since critics can, at times, be very harsh, I doubt A New Hope would have been the hit it was in 1977 had critics broken it down piece by piece.  As dead-on as these critics are sometimes, everyone needs to remembers that they are just critics.  They are just giving their opinions.  Since most of them are fans of film as an art, they critique films as such and their opinions are derived not from how entertaining the film is, but rather how successful the movie makers artistically expressed the film as a whole via the story, the dialogue, the acting, cinematography, etc.  Now, you may be saying, ""uhm, Jeff, all you are doing is giving your opinion.  Why should I listen to you?""  Well, good point.  But if you will notice, I write my opinions (at least for movies) based on how I would recommend them as entertainment value, specifically for families since I tend to see a lot of family movies with my kids.  And in the case of Attack of the Clones, I will be writing and comparing other critics' opinions based on the  Star Wars' FAN's point of view, as well as a family recommendation.  Either way, I'm not going to get carried away with the ""art"" of Attack as a cinematic masterpiece.  In fact, I love that the fact that Attack does not satisfy the artsy-fartsy movie critic, yet is still a FAN's movie and broke $100 million in its first weekend.  Since the original  Star Wars  trilogy was so huge AND had an established fanbase before critics were prevalent, it makes   Attack  bullet-proof to the critics.  Let's remember that fans loathed The Phantom Menace, while many critics like Roger Ebert, gave it a near-perfect rating (see his 1999 review here).

Now onto the critics...

Let's start out with the Grand Pooh-bah of movie critique, Roger Ebert:

First of all, after reading his review of The Phantom Menace, then Attack of the Clones, there were a couple of lines that were hypocritical.  

In the The Phantom Menace review, he wrote, ""The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained ""Julius Caesar."" I wish the ""Star Wars"" characters spoke with more elegance and wit (as Gore Vidal's Greeks and Romans do), but dialogue isn't the point, anyway: These movies are about new things to look at."".  

However, in the  Attack  review, he wrote, ""But as someone who admired the freshness and energy of the earlier films, I was amazed, at the end of ""Episode II,"" to realize that I had not heard one line of quotable, memorable dialogue.""  While at another point he states, ""

Hypocrite...

Frankly, the dialogue in the  Star Wars  movies has always been a little weak.  And, yes, I can completely understand that there is an element missing from this second trilogy so far that is the cynic, the skeptic, like Han Solo was in the first trilogy.  However, these movies are pre-destined.  We already now the RESULT of these three movies.  We want to know HOW it gets there.  The Phantom Menace was boring in many aspects (though not really as bad as everyone thought--our expectations would have NEVER been satisfied), but there had to be a start.  There had to be a beginning to it all.  I'm pretty sure that Lucas could have done a little better, but not much.  Building those characters and setting the tone for the future had to be done and with Attack, you can tell why Lucas did what he did.  Yes, he eats some crow in the movie by displaying the biggest fan-favorite character, Boba Fett, and limiting Jar-Jar's lines (yet maximizing his impact to the overall storyline).  However, Lucas did a superb job in getting the story moving toward where we know it will end up.

Across town from Ebert, the Chicago Tribune gives their version.  Mark Caro, who gave Attack 2 stars as Ebert did, writes: ""For such a visually oriented filmmaker, Lucas commits an unpardonable sin: He tells instead of shows.""

I can actually agree with this.  While the dialogue did not impress me much, the dialogue is not why I go to  Star Wars movies.  It's the story.  Granted, like The Phantom Menace, Lucas is packing a lot of story into the allotted time,  Attack is more exciting, has more interesting twists and, frankly, is setting us up for a what should be an incredible third movie.  However, as Caro wrote, to help pack more progress into this film, Lucas does end up ""telling"" a lot without showing the progress in visuals.  The exception is when Anakin goes to Tattoine and begins descending to the darkside once finding his mother.  The way that part of the story progressed was very visual and lead-up-to via the many references to his recurring bad dreams.

So is it a bad thing that Lucas has to tell us rather than show us?  Well, since it does not impact the overall amount of action in this movie, I would say no.  Is it different for Lucas?  Absolutely, but not necessarily a bad thing.  I think Lucas is trying to get himself out of the rut he put himself into by starting the story with Anakin as a child in The Phantom Menace.  In the first trilogy, the story seemed to flow better because there were not as many time-delays.  Luke was an upper teen in A New Hope and ended as a twenty-something in Return of the Jedi.  Lucas should have avoided trying to bring in new children fans and started Anakin out that way as well.  

Mark Caro's co-hort at the Chicago Tribune, Michael Willmington, is more of a fan focusing on the fan's appeal to this movie.  He gives the movie 4 stars and writes: ""Nothing in the first four movies quite matches the continuous visual bravura of this one, which is almost as much a digital age marvel as the '77 ""Star Wars"" was of an earlier era of miniatures and models. For most of its 2-hour span, the movie keeps topping itself, not dramatically, but with one pure, explosively delivered, ripely detailed action set-piece after another.""

I could not agree more.  When I was a five year old watching A New Hope, my interest in the movie was not because of the intricate storytelling, the relationship of the force to modern religious beliefs, the contrast of Han's cynicism to Luke's desire to believe it all.  No, I like how cool the Landspeeder was.  Man, it was a FLOATING CAR!  And I liked the Millennium Falcon.  Hyperdrive was cool!!  Lightsabers?  AWESOME!  And the X-Wing fighters flying through the corridors of the Death Star to find that one little hole that will make it blow up?  Oh yeah, baby.  THAT was what the movie was about.   Carry that interest to  The Empire Strikes Back when there were the cool snowspeeders on Hoth, the dual-cabined Cloud Pods on Bespin, Boba Fett's cool costume, Luke and Darth's first encounter, etc.  Then carry that yet again into Return of the Jedi, where there is an all-out, free-for-all fight extraordinaire when the second Death Star was going to be destroyed.  Have you ever seen so many Tie Fighters??  And those Biker Scouts were cool!!

See what I mean?  Ebert had it right when he reviewed Phantom.  Dialogue is secondary (if not even LESS important) to the cool visuals, the overall story and the action!  Lucas remembered that this time and that is why Attack is so good.  Hayden Christensen is an absolutely horrible actor.  I thought that throughout the film.  But does it ruin it?  Not at all.  You see more and more of where the story is going.  And to top it off, what you THINK is going to happen doesn't.  Despite how many trailers were released, you DON'T know what's going to happen.  As much as they showed you, you have not prepared yourself for what you will be seeing.  

So go do it...now...many, many, many more times over the summer.  Ignore the critics.  Go see Attack of the Clones today and form your own opinion.  If you are a   Star Wars fan, you will love it"

"Oct 06, 2014",3.5,"The second part of the Star wars prequel has a good script, better VFX and CGI, a good casting, and a great Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's performance as Anakin and Padmé, but it has a lot of drama and it results with a ""something's missing"" sensation at the end.

Also, less Jar Jar, which is always great to see. The clones are, while looking like cartoon characters, a great idea, and the end battle with them is a brilliant piece of cinema. Despite all this praise, the film does suffer from past problems, which includes political bullshit, which just bores the viewer. And not to mention, an even worse script: the love story arc is possibly the worst thing about any Star Wars film. But overall, a good movie."

"Sep 27, 2014",2,"Anything to do with Obi-Wan is awesome, anything to do with Anakin, is terrible, simple as that. It also just goes to show that Obi-Wan should have been the central character of the prequels, and then have Anakin be the overarching character of the entire series."

The film was quite a large amount better than it's predecessor, The Phantom Menace.

"Jul 30, 2014",3,"Grade:Higher 6/10

Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones is the second of the Star
Wars prequels and one that in my opinion, just about beats that of it's
previous film in the series. The story is upped quite a bit from
Phantom and much more is going on here and there and everywhere
throughout the galaxies, with much more fight scenes, an interesting
mystery running through the film and of course, more lightsabers.
Overall I felt it was just about an OK movie, and here below is why.

The story is fast paced, lots goes on in a quite long movie though and
so the film truly gets what it wants to get out in the right amount of
time. The thrills are also more abundant than Phantom and rival any of
the Star Wars for true thrilling action and big battles. I wasn't to
keen on the quite rushed ending though and there are parts of the story
which could have been done much better with more added depth and at
times, not enough is going on then suddenly lots is happening. 

From an acting perspective it isn't so bad this but also not the
greatest, Ewan McGregor is OK as Kenobi again and is in a much more
major role this time around, dealt well McGregor does. Hayden
Christensen is not the best person they could have got as Anakin, sure
he can do the action scenes fairly well and any fast movements, but his
acting is poor here and much work is needed on the character of Anakin.
Natalie Portman is much better this time around and the entire
supporting cast are fairly good in there roles, even a welcome sight of
a CGI Yoda.

Lucas and his writing skill suffer once again in this one, it never
quite harms the film to such an extent but it does mean certain scenes
are left awkward and just strange. His directing is good for this one,
he does seem to have worked a little harder for this one and the scenes
where his direction is most needed are worked out very well. The
effects are shall we say, over used, yet they are pretty good for 2002
and this film will always be known as a turning point in special
effects technology.

The main criticisms don't just lie in the writing, it's the effects too
and of course acting. The dialogue is fairly stingy and Lucas seriously
shouldn't have written this second or for that matter the first. I said
about the special effects but one major point is there is just too
much, the colour can make you feel a bit dizzy and it can seem near
every set is made from green screen or has been digitally done. And on
to the acting, it isn't just Hayden, not everyone is so comfortable in
there role, but I guess that is what you get with such an epic space
drama.

For Star Wars fans they should prefer this to the Phantom Menace but
compared to any other of the movies, they may feel bitterly
disappointed, It is a satisfactory film but for the true fans, maybe
not so. If you are new to the franchise then I feel you will like it
although watching it years after does not help the effects used and can
seem as if the producers were pretty lazy. This for me is the Star Wars
most kids should enjoy, it has a lot of fighting and big action
sequences, not to ruin any but they are spread well across the running
time.

Overall I give this a higher 6/10 meaning it is Just About OK in my opinion, many
will disagree but some will say it is better, that is for you to
decide. I have to admit from watching this when it first came out I did
like it much more back then but you see in time what is just about
wrong with the movie, but you also keep what is good about it. One more
thing, I may criticise Christensen but he shouldn't ruin the movie for
you, for the most part he is competent in the role as Anakin Skywalker."
"Jul 29, 2014",1.5,Hayden Christensen is such a bad actor.
"Jul 28, 2014",3,"Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) is plagued by nightmares of his mother whilst he attempts to protect Senator Amidala (Portman) with master Obi Wan (McGregor) investigating the assassination attempt on her life.

16 years after Return of the Jedi was released George Lucas returned with The Phantom Menace, arguably the most anticipated film of the 20th century. Quite right to as the Star Wars franchise had generated millions of fans world wide with it's out of the world colossal stories and brilliance. Critics and fans were left in dizziness when a long tongued creature called Jar Jar Binks stepped onto screen followed by an odd looking villain with a doubled ended lightsaber and a rather poor action hero Qui Gon as a leader. Not to mention the plot was all political with the battles oddly insignificant.

Nevertheless that didn't stop fans queuing around the block to see the second episode and in many aspects it seems the legend that is George Lucas sadly did not learn his lesson.

Thankfully that badly spoken Binks is missing for the vast majority but the essence of the plot remains intact as the plot is politically driven and whilst we see perhaps more action and new creatures, it does not prevent the fact this is in reality hardly a reflection of what predeceased it in the late 70's.

Attack of the Clones is what you might call a third party seller. The t-shirt of Manchester United that you don't see in Old Trafford.

It is easy to criticize considering how the previous 3 releases were all bravado and we had no clue what was around the corner. These films are building towards something and there clues are dropped with the eventual outcome easily noticeable. The suspense has disappeared also with the droids easy pickings and the eventual war come the end barely a blip on the radar.

Attack of the clones also seems to have a problem establishing its characters. Anakin is the exception as we know his fate and with Christensen's charm we see his temper bubbling with delicious vigour, even if the romantic scripting wears thin. McGregor's Obi Wan can be too controlling for comfort but the wise sayings of Yoda and Master Windu let the side down as everything feels stated rather than spontaneous and flowing as it should obviously be.

This 2002 release isn't all doom and gloom. There is no denying the effects are spellbinding and the lightsaber duels are as ever exciting. The final showdown with Dooku is good, if strange to see Yoda so lively.

As with all other Star Wars pictures you want to like it, and the idea of life on other galaxies is exciting and the temperature does rise in the second half. It's a let down but given the marvel of the originals there was never any competing. Worthy watch as Revenge of the Sith generates some unanswered questions."
"Jul 28, 2014",2.5,This movie was almost as terrible as the first
"Jul 28, 2014",2,"Viewers could be forgiven for thinking that everyone besides the irritating Jar Jar Binks were the clones that the hopelessly corny title is referring to; they are stiff and bland and their dialogue formulaic and uninteresting, merely there to advance the plot. The action sequences are for the most part, as a result of cgi overload, equally as bland."
"Jul 25, 2014",0.5,So THIS move got 67% but Man of Steel got under 60%? Unreal. Anyway - this may be one of the worst successful movies I've ever seen. There's nothing redeeming about it to me.

"Jul 22, 2014",3.5,"A bit of bad dialogue and acting, redeemed by good effects and some really good action."
"Jul 18, 2014",2.5,Definitely better than Phantom Menace. The battle scenes are cool. Better story.
"Jul 18, 2014",3.5,"A little better than The Phantom Menace, but still not amazing. It has some fun action sequences, but it's pretty boring sometimes."
"Jul 17, 2014",3,"What I got to say about ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is that it's a much better improvement from the first one. The performances in this one are little bit better. The directing George Lucas is good. The screenplay by Jonathan Hales has a lot more story-line for my opinion. The score is outstanding. And the effects are great. ""I got to say that I really enjoyed the second one little bit better because it has a little story-line to it for my opinion."" Well done!!!"
"Jul 14, 2014",3.5,"Once again, Star Wars proves to be a shadow of its former self; Episode II is victim of some dire dialogue, but the defining visuals and political theme help to mix things up. And it can always be relied upon for a good few duels."
"Jul 09, 2014",0.5,"Just awful! This movie delivers nothing to the big picture, it's a bunch of pointless action and pointless dialogue. The dialogue between PadmÃ¨ and Anakin is just bad. These two have no reason to be in love. The plot and story flawed and rushed by George Lucas. Thank God that it was fixed in Revenge Of The Sith!"
"Jul 08, 2014",5,"The saga continues, great entry... Classic battle action"
"Jul 06, 2014",3.5,Obi-Wan storyline = good.  Anakin &amp; Padme storyline = boring.  Clone battle sequences and Yoda kicking butt elevates the rating 1/2 a star.
"Jul 05, 2014",2.5,"The script and actors fail to produce even a single believable or likable character, rendering even the most brilliant of action scenes completely moot."
"Jul 04, 2014",4,"This 2002 blockbuster is actually really good. It has been ten years since the events of the phantom menace, Anakin is reunited with Padme and the jedi council after training with Obi Wan. Jar Jar Binks is toned down in the second film which for some fans was a huge relief. The action is packed into several really memorable scenes. Acclaimed actor Christopher Lee joins the cast as the villian Count Doolu. The CGI improves over the first. The only thing that could have been changed is Anakin. Anakin is a really important character in the universe of Star Wars. After all, he is pretty much the star of all of the movies. However, in this movie, Anakin likes to get upset and wine, yell, and really just complain about everything. It's not intolerable, but it doesn't seem like Darth Vader as a kid would have done that. Overall, this fast paced action flick does justice as a prequel to one of the largest science fiction epics of all time."

"Jun 24, 2014",1.5,"This film is utterly awful.  The ""romantic"" scenes between Anakin and Padme made me look away in embarrassment, especially for Natalie Portman since she is a higher-caliber actress than this movie would have you think.  The film is devoid of cool main villains; Jango Fett is kind of cool but of course he's simply a rehash of Boba from the originals so he doesn't count.  Speaking of count, Dooku is just the most boring of the Sith and Maul was much more exotic and interesting.  The ""Banking Clan"" is just a bunch of wimpy little geriatric aliens of no consequence.  The final battle involves a myriad of respected Jedi flying into a stadium and virtually throwing their lives away battling endless waves of droids.  I lost respect for Yoda, as he's now just a fighter bouncing around with his mini-saber.  The clones are just Jango Fett copies.  So we have a war pitting these copies vs. droids.  Who cares?  The Geonosians, too, are just identical bugs.  At least in the originals soldiers were individual people and when you saw a Rebel getting shot, you could actually feel something for him.  Now we have a war that's just about who can crank out the most soldiers from machines.

The overused CGI takes the spirit out.  The models in the originals were awesome and beautiful and appeared to actually be there.  There are some cool war weapons here like the AT-TE (the six-legged vehicle), but nothing outdoes the infinitely cool Super Star Destroyer, epic AT-AT, and even the creative AT-ST.  

I make a lot of comparisons, but you have to.  This is Star Wars.  And just for that reason I recommend a view anyway."
"Jun 24, 2014",3,"I always remembered Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones as being my second-least favourite of the series, and upon seeing Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes back with a nature mind it sunk to the bottom. But to he certain of where it sat on the list, I had to go back and see it again. 

Rotten Tomatoes deems Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace to be the worst film in the series with a rating of only 57% from critics, while Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is deemed superior with a score of 67% I will never understand this because although Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is an imperfect film with a weak script and the presence of Jar Jar Binx, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones has an even weaker script, less action and the presence of Hayden Christensen. 
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is clearly the worst film of the series, and I say that as a person who grew up with my life in debt to how much I love the Star Wars series. No matter what, Star Wars will always be the greatest movie series of all time to me for its entertainment value, it's stories and the fact that it has been influential to so much cinema, literature and video games. So to see where it hits a low point with Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is hard to face.
Everything wrong with Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is the problem with Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, only slightly worse, with the exception of the fact that this time Jar Jar Binx receives very little screen time. It takes no time before all the issues in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones are clear.
The first line in the script is Captain Panaka deeming that the journey he and his crew have taken proved to be safe with no real danger. Instantly after that, there is an explosion and death. After that single line, I knew that the script in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones would be poor form. The timing of the first line is generic and proves that George Lucas has decided to take a predictable angle on the story. But I could not predict just how pathetic the script in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones would end up being, even though I'm well aware of how poor it was in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The dialogue is consistently tacky and poorly conceived, relying on generic Star Wars language, lame jokes and more. But nothing in the script hold a Gungan's head to the poor quality of the romantic dialogue in the film. 
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones puts most of its focus on establishing the relationship between Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidalla. The dialogue is full of lines memorable for how cheesy they are, lines like ""I truly...deeply.. love you."" or when the two converse for the first time in years. I'm going to have to cut an except out of the script to reveal how poor quality it is:
""Padme: Ani? My goodness, you've grown.
Anakin: So have you, grown more beautiful I mean... for a senator, I mean.
Padme: Ani, you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.""

Imagine about 60 minutes of this and you have essentially a full understanding of that to expect from the romantic theme in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. The dialogue in many of the other scenes is poor as well, but nothing is equal to the lacklustre romantic scenes in shoddy quality. And the problem isn't just that, but the chemistry between the two romantically linked characters is, to quote a friend of mine ""like the chemistry between two chairs."" There feels like no passion is brewing between them, so it is hard to find their relationship the slightest bit compelling. I saw no hint that either of them were interested in each other at all, and when they first kissed you can clearly see just how awkward everything was. It's like neither of them are able to acknowledge that the other person is actually in the room at the time. This is problematic as it is one of the central themes in the story, but I cannot feel the love tonight. It is enough that an excess of romance is misplaced in a science fiction action adventure film, but to top it off Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman lack chemistry, although it is clear that Natalie Portman is trying and her natural charisma has its moments. The fault is mostly in Hayden Christensen who went from being the talented and Golden Globe nominated actor from Life as a House to the cringe worthy Golden Raspberry award winning actor from Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. Hayden Christensen is an actor I remember enjoying for his performance in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. And in the many years since I have last seen the film, I have heard people tell me about a terrible he was playing Anakin Skywalker. Looking at it now, I can completely understand why. It is clear that the script is poor, but at least the other actors manage to make it feel genuine. Hayden Christensen has to force it from his own throat as if he is choking on poor dialogue. Before most of his lines you can actually see him shake or twitch, as if he is being given an electro shock to remember that it is his turn to say something. When he says it, there is no emotion and he completely falls flat. This is much more serious a problem than you would think as he is the main character in the film, receiving the most screen time of any cast members. But he has the least talent of any of them. Although he is handsome enough and he has the youth and mobility to make him convincing for the part, the acting is something completely different. Hayden Christensen could be a good generic action film star or a decent dramatic actor in small scale films, but in one where he has to combine both personas and hold up the entire film on his shoulders he fails to do so. Anakin Skywalker does not seem to be the chosen one in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, because he does nothing but make mistake after mistake, and that is one of the few convincing things that Hayden Christensen is able to do unfortunately. While the character is clearly poorly sketched, Hayden Christensen offers nothing to save the part and leaves viewers wondering just how he can't share a good chemistry with Natalie Portman. I mean, the actress is an Academy Award winner. She is a beautiful woman and one of my all time favourite actresses, and even in a weakly sketched character she manages to do just enough to pass. But Hayden Christensen can feel nothing for her or even pretend to for the sake of the movie, and so he seems like nothing more than a self- obsessed awkward teenager with a lightsaber. That doesn't sound to me like someone who should bring balance to the force. To put it blankly, Hayden Christensen has zero charisma in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and he doesn't seem like he is even trying. A bad character for a bad actor, they seem to be a match. But neither of those things are a match for a Star Wars film. The only props I can give him are the fact that in some of his more emotionally tense scenes he projects anger well enough. But those are brief, too brief unfortunately. As harsh as it is for me to say this, Hayden Christensen is essentially Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones's answer to Ahmed Best's role in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, although more cringe worthy and less annoying.
So the script and the performance of Hayden Christensen are two of the primary issues in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. But George Lucas just refuses to stop there.
The first action scene in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones has Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker engaged in a hovercar chase through the Courascant city, and it is bereft of thrills or exhilaration. I mean, Obi-Wan Kenobi is a wise Jedi Master, and out of nowhere when he sees a hover droid outside the window in the sky he jumps through it and grabs onto it regardless of the fact that he is extremely far above the ground. There is nothing sensible in this scene whatsoever, and it reveals that the writers of the film have degraded the sensibility of the character Obi-Wan Kenobi from being the ambitious warrior who got retribution for the death of his master Qui-Gonn Jinn by defeating Sith Warrior Darth Maul. Frankly, the entire scene is nothing but reminiscent of a mix of the X-Wing Fighter trench run in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and the podracing scene in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. It's not as cool as it sound though, and it simply feels derivative of Luc Besson's science fiction film The Fifth Element which had memorable flying car chase scenes. If there was more of this and less terrible romantic scenes, then Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones could have least been ok. But considering that this is the only action scene for an extended period at the start of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, it just is not pleasant. 
The next flaw in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones proves to be the quantity of the action. Although Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace didn't have enough action to support its excess of poor dialogue, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones has even less. Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace had a versatile mix of lightsaber battles, racing and chasing scenes, big scale war battles as spaceship combat. Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones has little in the way of versatility, and less in the way of quantity. Like I said, the first action scene is derived from The Fifth Element, and the wait for the next one is worse than the wait for the first one because the action theme has been introduced and could actually be capitalised on, but instead the film just wastes the viewer's time by making them wait around through poorly conceived political ramblings and thinly sketched characters until finally something happens. Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones waits until more than 100 minutes in until the clones attach, and the last 40 minutes of the film are the best moments of the film. But the problem is having to wait for things to actually happen. Viewers have to wait around through a lot in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and the action quotient has gone on a serious decrease since the last film. Most of the film that isn't senseless dialogue is just George Lucas showing off scenery, a lot of footage of characters standing on sets as the green screens behind them show off what kind of financing he has secured. But it gets boring fast, and the scenery is very repetitive and fails to overshadow the lack of plot dynamics. As beautiful as Naboo looks and as nostalgic as the sights of the Lars home on Tatooine is, it still is not enough to overshadow the poorly conceived script and lacklustre pace which gets dragged out for 142 minutes of running time. Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is the only film in the series not to end on a sufficient lightsaber battle scene. While the final lightsaber duel had some moments, it was way too brief and too many of the shots in the battle between Count Dooku and Anakin Skywalker are depicted through shots that are excessively close where you can't even see the lightsabers clash, you can only see the light from them reflecting on their faces. So even the lightsaber duels have gone down in quality, and that is a serious problem.
Plus, although Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is so focused on how planets are pulling away from the Galactic Federation and joining a separatist movement, it's story is too small in ambitions. Despite galaxy of political upheaval, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is too focused on the smaller picture to actually capture what it is trying to say. Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace revealed how the corrupt actions of the Trade Federation is affecting the people in the political world, as well as the inhabitants of the planet Naboo. Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is too focused merely on the romance between Queen Padme Amidala and Anakin Skywalker as well as the mishaps of Obi-Wan Kenobi's journey to actually grasp the bigger picture. Despite attempting to tackle politics, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones fails to even go beyond its small group of characters. It tries, and it puts a lot of characters in there, but it only touches upon most of them as if they are meagre subplots in a bigger picture without showing us what the bigger picture is. Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is a significant drop in scale since it's previous film and focuses mostly on its characters, but it doesn't supply itself with enough thoughtfully conceived characters to anchor the spectacle.
And lastly why the hell Jar Jar Binx came back after such critical backlash is way beyond me. He is cringe worthy during his few brief scenes, and the fact that he is given the role of Queen Amidala's proxy in the senate while she goes into hiding truly befuddles me. I can't understand why George Lucas felt a need to torture his fans with more humour which is about as funny as watching a mentally disabled child falling down the stairs. The force was clearly not with George Lucas when he conceived half the ideas in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and I can't think of any sensible reason why he gave Ahmed Best any more lines. More like Ahmed Worst.
So Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is clearly the worst of the series, and while critics and fans are out giving flack to Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, at least it had a big scale to its story and a lot of versatile action scenes.
But for many reasons, including the fact that Star Wars is my all time favourite movie series, I have to say that Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones was still a decent film.
Although the story in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is not perfectly told, it is an interesting one. Despite the focus on the hammy romantic drama, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones also benefits from the fact that it introduces the theme of the clone wars to the Star Wars series. Revealing how politics doesn't work when one side wants full power, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones tells a story about how even heroes are seduced by corruption and power which leads to war. The character Count Dooku isn't given enough depth or background, but as he was once a Jedi Master who had turned to fear at the death of his Padawan Qui Gon Jinn, he is the symbol of political corruption and how fear manifests itself into the path to the dark side. As Jedi Master Yoda commented in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace ""Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate... leads to suffering."". Although the story does not show Count Dooku as he transitions into Darth Tyrannus, it presents an interesting point in his life where he has become so obsessed by power that he leads a war against the Jedi, the people he once belonged to. The political concepts in the film are not the most entertaining, but the general themes that they cover are handled better than the ones in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in terms of subject matter. That film was more focused on the way that people who controlled the international import-export exchange became greedy and attempted to overthrow a planet by plunging it into a state of war which is pretty ridiculous considering that it is all based on trade routes, while Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  is more focused on separating society and segregating people into causing intergalactic warfare. Although the action quantity and quality in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  is seriously insufficient, the fact is that it goes for a lot with its political agenda and while it has to flip back and fourth between multiple perspectives of that as well as a cheesy romance story, it does manage to serve as a decent film in the end because of how it starts off the clone wars before the years of conflict which would come to a new awakening in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Frankly, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones has a pretty big story, and while a lot of its elements are poor form, as a whole it does the job of being a lacklustre but nevertheless sufficient enough entry into the series.
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones comes to difficulties in terms of action scenes because of the fact that there is very minimum and what there is primarily lacks the elements which made the action exciting in the preceding Star Wars films. Like I said, it feels more influenced by The Fifth Element than by western and eastern films. But all in all the thigns all look cool. While Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  is a lot more reliant on visual effects than it is on well choreographed action scenes, the fun of a hovercar chase through the city can be felt, and while the final lightsaber battle is not the most exciting due to a poor execution of visual style in the scenes, the moment when a CGI rendered Yoda engages in battle with a well choreographed Christopher Lee is memorable and entertaining. The highlight of the film is when the titular Clones make their first action focused appearance and engage in a big scale climactic battle showing off their skills with weapons and the kind of technology they have been assigned. The big action finale of the film is pretty entertaining, if a little short. So the fact is that Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones has a lot of promise and plenty of entertainment value, even though it is not precisely as powerful as it should be. At least it does show off just what kind of visual effects can be offered to films in this day and age which is pretty good, because the movements of all the characters and vehicles in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  feels very organic and looks awesome.
Plus, the one good thing that Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones does is returning to its western theme. The entire planet of Geonoissis is a lot more reminiscent of the old west than the other planets covered in the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. While it does not have the same kind of structure to society where everyone has their own power, it presents a more dystopian themed western setting where the violent have learned powerful and overthrown their own culture. Not to mention that visually, Geonosis has all the dry scenery of the old west and constantly feels gritty in a way which is reminiscent of Tattooine. So Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones does have minor elements which present a step back to what made the original trilogy relevant to western cinema. Plus the obvious fact that Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones actually goes back to Tatooine and reveals the kind of life that Anakin Skywalker had left behind back there and the was that things have changed in the many years since.
But back on the visual topic of the film, as well as the magnificent visual effects that are presented in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, it makes the universe feel flawlessly believable with awesome scenery which reinforces the general feeling of the planets very well in an atmospheric manner. From a technical perspective, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  is just unforgettable. I mean the scenery can be a little repetitive at times, but as a whole it is powerfully convincing and gives the film the glamourous science fiction image that it needs in many scenes, as well as the tranquil serenity in others. The mood of each scene can essentially be defined by how it all looks, and then the musical score just adds to that. The one thing which is still consistently excellent and on par with all the other Star Wars films is John Williams' musical score. As well as capturing many of the old themes that he has crafted for all the Star Wars films, he really knows where the heart of the music lies and give is enough so that it is both epic and atmospheric. The new musical elements that John Williams incorporates into Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones are brilliant and present the one aspect of the film which is really lacking in any conceivable flaws. John Willliams is the one person involved in the Star Wars films who never lost sight of what was crucial, and so in actuality what he contributes to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is the best quality element of the film. The entire auditory experience of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is great because of its musical score, not to mention the iconic sound effects of the film and the way they are edited so perfectly into the timeframe of the film. 
The other excellent visual aspects of the film are the costumes which have a lot of versatile colour, as well as the makeup applied to many actors to present that they are of different species. Everything in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  looks and sounds legitimate, so it soars up high in terms of technical qualities.
And when it comes down to the cast, although they are burdened by  a Golden Raspberry Award winning script and the fact that Hayden Christensen is one of the actors, they manage to contribute their part to the success of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones fairly well.
While the general script in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  is poor form, Ewan McGregor manages to deliver his lines surprisingly organically. I was astounded, because half the time when he speaks you can tell that what he is saying is bad dialogue, and yet it is hard to care because of how well he says it. A lot of Obi-Wan Kenobi's lines in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  are comically themed, and while they are not so consistently funny, Ewan McGregor delivers them with the kind of charisma that is really necessary for them to succeed. In contrast to his much younger appearance in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Ewan McGregor has adopted an appearance more suited to his developed character as it gives him a sense of wisdom which is important as he has now reached the status of a Jedi Master. And his skilful handling of a lightsaber is matched by the pure strength of his line delivery as his emotions are always suiting to the scene very well. Ewan McGregor intergrates his line delivery with his physical stature into Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  very well, and it ends up being a fairly strong leading performance. Honestly, I'm a sucker for the actor because I have loved him since childhood and feel that he deserves an Academy Award nomination for something, but even with that the simple fact is that he is great.
Natalie Portman's performance in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is a much criticized one, but I found many aspects of her performance that were still great. Although her chemistry with Hayden Christensen is terrible, at least she makes an effort. She really wants to succeed in the part and despite some terrible writing she is forced to speak, she manages to put enough charisma into the part so that she is likable, admirable and entertaining above all. Natalie Portman is underrated for her performance in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and she honestly fits the part really well  because she captures a certain charm through mixing the elegance of a princess with the determination of a warrior which has her paralleling Carrie Fisher who played Princess Leia Amidala in the original Star Wars trilogy well. Natalie Portman is no Carrie Fisher, but she stands up and is determined to succeed which she is admirable for.
Newcomer Christopher Lee is great as Count Dooku. His eyes suggest that he has a certain darkly power that surrounds him and it fits the atmosphere of the dark side of the force which reinforces his character, and his line delivery it a certain deep booming tone which cries manipulation as his most powerful strength. I was impressed with his ability to engage in choreographed fight scenes so well, and he has not kicked so much ass since he played Dr Fu Manchu many decades ago. Christopher Lee is perfect for the role of Count Dooku as he wields his lightsaber with true strength and delivers his lines with the perfect darkness to say that he has become overwhelmed by the dark side of the force. As a Sith Lord, Christopher Lee serves as an example of perfect casting in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.
Samuel L. Jackson is also seriously great in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. Returning to the same role he played in the preceding Star Wars film, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones actually shows Samuel L. Jackson getting involved with the action and kicking a lot of ass in the process. He wields his lightsaber with indescribable power and flails it around with powerful choreography, and he delivers his lines with such power that it is intimidating. Without going into a stereotypical character or embodying the Samuel L. Jackson archetype, he makes Mace Windu a powerful figure who stands out on his own while still maintaining the natural charisma that Samuel L. Jackson brings to every role, and he manages to create intimidation which echoes the effect of his Academy Award nominated performance in Pulp Fiction. Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones doesn't show Samuel L. Jackson standing up as excellently as he did in Pulp Fiction, but his performance is still excellent and he deserves praise for it.
Ian McDarmid also makes a powerful supporting effort in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. Delivering his lines in the role of Senator Palpatine, he shows a true dedication to the material and emvodies the role of a politician really well as well as capturing the perfect darkness of his alter-ego, Darth Sifious. Ian McDarmid does an excellent job of being two-faced in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and he brings more energy to the cast.
Australian actors Rose Byrne and Joel Edgerton also make good supporting figures in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.

So Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is my least favourite of the series due to its slow pace, its tedious length, the lack of action and lack of versatility in what action scenes do actually exist and the performance of Hayden Christensen. But the rest of the cast make up for it, and the story is decent enough to pass while the technical qualities of Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones continue to amaze and astound me without difficulty."

The dialogue and acting are just as awful as the first, but the effects and the sheer scope of the Star Wars universe keep the film from being downright unwatchable."

"Jun 06, 2014",3,"Far better than The Phantom Menace but still miles away from being any good compared to the originals. If Anakin and Obi-Wan had more screen-time together, I would have been more forgiving. But instead we had to sit through painful romance scenes between Anakin and Padme. Scenes that I suppose were necessary, but didn't need as much focus. Anakin comes out as too unlikable, which should be the opposite. We're supposed to like this character so that when he eventually turns to the Dark Side in the next film it's more tragic. Jango was a cool addition but he only seems there for fan-service rather than amounting to much in the plot other than being the one who donated his DNA to create the clone army. Christopher Lee is the highlight of the film for me, but he doesn't show up until halfway in the film.

"Jun 06, 2014",3,"Hayden Christiansen's abysmal performance puts the Anakin story in freefall, and the rest of the film is dumbed down for its obvious target audience of children.

It's better than the previous film, but that's not really saying much."
"May 28, 2014",2.5,"Although it is a vast improvement from the previous installment and offers some extremely important metanarrative, Episode II still suffers from awkwardness, joined this time by an extremely doushy main character.

- Details Breakdown -

The Good: As with Episode I, the metanarrative here is far more impressive and important than any of the characters' storylines. The plan of the Sith has finally come to light and it is a rather impressive one. It is not an easy task to turn a galactic republic into a galactic empire and this movie shows how it managed to be done as well as show the slippery slope of certain kinds of political actions. We see even more factions and galactic political struggles in this movie than in the last and it makes the universe feel more complete and the weakness of the republic more realistic. The audience is given one of the largest battles in Star Wars history and the scale alone puts things in perspective and really puts the ""wars"" in Star Wars. The beginning and end of this movie are really where it shines because during these times it focuses on the big picture, rather than on the small stories of the lead characters that nobody likes or cares about. While Obi-Wan is searching for Camino or Count Dooku is in talks with the various clans and factions making up the separatists, you can lose yourself in the bigger picture and really see how the universe in Ep. 4-6 came to being. Also, we all get to see Yoda fight like a badass for the first time ever and that scene alone is enough to make any fan happy. This movie is a major step up from Episode 1 in every way possible and it fixed the audio issues, poor editing, and Lucas finally stopped using the first take of every shot and worked his actors a little bit for better performances.

The Bad: Everything to do with Anakin and Padme bogs down the story and makes you want to bang your head into a wall. The acting is bad (although not as bad as Ep 1) and the characters are extremely unlikable. Anakin is arrogant, whiny, and super duper creepy the whole movie and you just want him to get stabbed in his creeper face. Padme is less annoying, but the fact that she somehow falls in love with a doushe when she is a super hot senator with probably loads of options across the galaxy incredibly weakens her character. Lucas' sexism comes out in this movie because even though he started with a strong female lead character, he felt the need to belittle her and just make her another damsel in distress in this movie. While characters constantly say she can take care of herself, she is in constant need of saving and it gets old real quick. The jokes and puns are more than groan worthy, they are an abomination. While Jedi die in the arena to try and save the galaxy, Lucas has C-3PO spouting off moronic lines that just make you think, ""who gives a sh*t?"". Life is not even close to precious in Lucas' world and nobody is even remotely sad when their friends die around them. Anakin starts slaughtering the Geonosians as soon as he lands on the planet and doesn't even try to talk to them. Of course they're going to execute you, you're a raving psychopath Anakin. People are gunned down in the streets like it is all fun and games and Lucas doesn't even have the JEDI, the protectors of the peace and the ones that are supposed to value life the most, stop to give a crap. Just like in Episode 1, the enemies are mostly just droids and the heroes rarely face off against their actual opponents, making the battles hollow. Although the end battle is great, having a bunch of clones against a bunch of droids is not particularly interesting since Lucas made it extremely clear that both sides are very expendable. There's no emotional connection the any of the factions or even any of the characters. Anakin is the only one that even has emotions and his emotions just turn him into a serial killer one minute and a little baby the next. No wonder the Jedi banned emotions, in the Star Wars universe emotions are a rare occurrence and when you do have them, they are wild and off the charts crazy. Although a lot of this movie is important for the bigger picture, it could have easily been combined with Episode 1 into a single movie. Cut out all of the Padme and Anakin scenes at the lake house in this movie and almost the entire battle of Naboo, and have the two of them get to know each other better on Coruscant and not in a creepy way, problem solved."
"May 27, 2014",3.5,"The second episode of the Star Wars saga-2002's Attack of the Clones-doesn't elevate the standards of the material to a more meaningful experience, but still delivers what its predecessor didn't; being a fun adventure with an intriguing script, plenty of memorable scenes, and filled with (some) of the magic that worked for George Lucas in the past. Gone is the indifferent and adolescent tone from Episode I and all that came with it (as in adolescent humor). It is evident Lucas took the (many) criticisms to heart and it shows (even reducing characters that would have surely served a bigger role if not for the backlash). All is not perfect with Episode II though, in that a majority of the script is devoted to a star-crossed love narrative (in which Lucas brought in Jonathan Hales as co-writer for) that feels forced, hammy and (worst) artificial. Swapping the television soap opera program of Dallas to the space opera of Star Wars, Hales' contribution to the dialogue in these scenes is steeped in melodrama with no nuance or subtext. It leaves the performers reduced to saying awkward lines and Lucas's stiff camera movement and direction doesn't help. The perfect pairing for all the artificial dialogue and performances comes in the form of Lucas (again) relying too much on CGI to carry out the action, leaving the film feeling bloated and (again) superficial. Against all of these negative aspects of the film, Attack of the Clones does have plenty of positives. The main plot of the picture is mystery-driven and does a decent attempt to make you care (or interested) in what is going on and the main set pieces are all fun (and are unapologetically inspired from the 1940 TV Serial's that initially inspired Lucas to the whole Star Wars idea). Although there are many factors hindering the viewing experience of Episode II, the film still manages to be a worthy entry into the Star Wars saga."
"May 24, 2014",2.5,"Only slightly better than TPM. It feels like a incomplete work. How can you have great character actors like Christopher Lee and Sam Jackson and squander their screen time like this? The only good things about this is the interaction between Anakin and Obi-Wan and it's great to see how the infamous Clone Wars started, but other then that not a whole lot to like about this. Another misfire I'm afraid. 5 / 10"
"May 24, 2014",1.5,"The entire movie feels like a big joke. Even the legendary Christopher Lee gets a laughable fight scene with Yoda on crack. If the awkward romance between Christensen and Portman won't make you laugh, it will make you hurl. The exploration of new planets in our beloved galaxy far, far away is the only thing that makes this entry worth watching."
"May 19, 2014",1.5,Eh this movie was really boring and the acting was good but this movie kinda sucked.
"May 17, 2014",3.5,Three and a half stars.
"May 16, 2014",3,"Moderately interesting when compared to the previous instalment, part two of this trilogy still suffers under the weight of the same problems of the previous movies flaws.
AOTC has a perfect idea working for it, this is the point where that single crack appears that is going to doom the whole building and there's nothing to stop it any more. If we could have seen the proper consequences for the events in Episode 1, something like an basic armed guard on all transport, something akin to air marshals on planes in the US today, or any hint that paradise was being corrupted without anyone even batting an eyelid at it other than a few, to portray the separatists as the unfortunate scapegoats and doomed heroes trying to save the Republic from destruction rather than an evil organisation of cookie cutter bag guys who broke away from the Republic just 'cuz. Maybe a brief heated argument between a senator from planet (X) and three from planets (Y) (Z) and (0), (X) stepping forwards and claiming the reforms that Palpatine is doing is only making things worse, while the rest are portrayed as ruthless Zealots who rally most of the senate behind them with words like ""Patriotism"" ""Loyalty"" and ""For the Greater Good"", culminating in having (Y Z and 0) have their personal guards force (X) out of the senate at gun point, with a possible note of tension as to whether he's even alive still. 
We've got the base line for that with Padme, but her involvement in the anti-war message is lost within the first minute of the movie, her ship explodes and all reference to a true anti-war message is lost among finding her attacker and learning about the clones, etc, etc.
Anakin's character was written badly wrong for what tone Lucas seemed to be shooting for. He's a prodigy whose natural talent has him getting things far quicker than the norm, who wants to rush ahead and get to the finish line without waiting. There are two ways to do this, 
to have him eager to test himself at every encounter and feel both ashamed and thrilled every time he's just done something he shouldn't.
or he can be petulant about it, showing no concern for anything but himself.
One is meant to make you root for him, one makes you despise him and for the life of me I can't figure out why Lucas chose to write Anakin as a prissy, whiny little brat in this movie ""as well""
As with the last review on this trilogy, I spoke about the sound and visual effects and I intend to do the same here.
The scene where Jango Fett is trying to kill Obi-Wann with those space mines near Kamino was ridiculously loud and offensive, even at home if that scene is on I tend to cringe with the levels that the sound editor and Lucas pushed it. Again I know that he was going for a tone here, but making the explosion sound more ear bleedingly impressive than the destruction of ""both"" Death Stars combined shows a mistake there. I am not taking about the visuals either, this is entirely sound related.
Bringing characters back for no reason other than to have them in the movie and to have contrived explanations as to why characters do the things they do make this a less than perfect movie in an already lacking triogy of films.
That I won't watch unless marathoning Star Wars."
"May 13, 2014",1,"Not only the worst of the prequels but the worst of the Star Wars franchise as a whole. What drags this movie down is the heavy handed, awkward romance between Anakin and Padme. What made the relationship between Han Solo and Princess Leia so great was the fact that there was development and flirtatious banter. You actually had a connection. Here there's just no development. Prior to them actually confessing their love for one another all that's happened is Anakin's stolen food off of Padme's plate with the force, awkward touching, ridiculous dialogue, and Anakin throwing a fit like a toddler. This movie is paced terribly, acted even worse, and directed with extreme conviction that blinds him from it's flaws."
"May 13, 2014",4,Good Follow Up..............
"May 12, 2014",3,"Despite some very cool moments. Attack of the clones suffers from dated CGI, green/blue screens, sloppily written dialogue, and poor acting from Hayden Christensen. At least George Lucas lessened Jar Jar Binks."
"May 12, 2014",3.5,"Stronger than its predecessor, though not by much, this movie suffers differently than Phantom Menace.  Where Ep. 1 had no clear direction, the problem with this movie is that the direction is too focused on the painfully bad love story of Anakin and Padme.  This weighs the movie down considerably.  Ewan McGregor, as always, steals the show in every scene he's in.  His storyline was actually quite interesting and felt more akin to the original trilogy than the rest of the movie.  Nonetheless, the action is good (not great) and the effects are awesome."
"May 11, 2014",1,"In my opinion the worst of all the Star Wars pictures. I remember being very disappointed leaving the cinema after it. There aren't any improvements on Phantom Menace in this film. The action sequences are also far over the top. The dialogue is incredibly boring and poorly written. Lucas also decided to keep the much hated Jar Jar Binks in it. Not only that but he gets promoted among his people in to some position of power which is farcical. To be honest I would've added another star just to see him killed off! 
  The problem with the prequels is they have very little of the things that made the first trilogy so great. Lucas seems to think putting a few light sabre scenes in is enough to make a good Star Wars film, it isn't!"
"May 10, 2014",2.5,"Most redeeming qualities about this film are completely overshadowed by it's weak lead performance and atrocious script.  Ewan McGregor does the best he can, though, and i guess that's worth something."
"May 10, 2014",0.5,"Worst Star Wars ever. No good plots, acting, or even suspense. And the CGI is terrible and confusing. Rapes the originals and replaces it with card board cutouts with no emotion."
"May 10, 2014",4,Anakin's arrogance annoys me but I must admit that his character made this film more energetic and interesting.
"May 07, 2014",3,"It's 10 Years After The Events Of Episode 1, Padme Amidala Is Now A Senator Of Naboo, While Anakin Is Developing Into A Young Man &amp; A Somewhat Good Jedi Knight. The Three Main Characters Are Thrown Together For The First Time Since The Trade Federation Invasion Of Naboo When The Senator's Life Is Threatened By Political Seperatists. The Choices Made However Will Impact Both Their Fates And The Destiny Of The Republic. With The Forbidden Love Theme Running All The Way Through It's Plot And The Start Of The Clone Wars, This Is A Highly Charged Sci-Fi Action Thriller That Has Some Romance Scenes &amp; Some Slightly Dark Scenes. This Is An Enjoyable Film And Features A Great Cast With A Considerably Better Script. This Film Doesn't Drag On As Much As It's Predecessor, This Is Because Most Of The Politics Were Adressed In The Previous Film &amp; Also For It's Massive Clone Wars Scenes Which Can Easily Divided Into A Four Part Battle With A Healthy Run Time."
"May 05, 2014",2,Does anyone remember this movie? I mean even the phantom menace had one stand out scene but this just doesn't. It may be better than phantom menace but its still not good.
"May 05, 2014",2,"I got to see this movie twice during it's theatrical release. And while it seemed exciting at the time, this movie didn't age well in my mind &amp; in the minds of many old school SW fans. I didn't want to hate on it, but I just wasn't a big fan of Hayden Christiansen's performace as ""Anakin Skywalker"". Perhaps because the character might have been written as ""creepy"" towards Padme. It also didn't help that people in theaters laughed when he had nightmares. The climactic lightsaber battle was cool. Audiences cheered &amp; we were shown how ""Yoda"" is a true badass. His victory over Dooku should have been a sure thing. At least they toned down Jar Jar's presence despite endorsing the man who would corrupt the Galaxy for many years. It was a step up from ""Phantom Menace"", but it lacked in any of the magic given to us by the movies of the Original Trilogy."
"May 04, 2014",2,my least favorite star wars movie... till the last 1/2 hour and battle scene otherwise it was pretty lame.
"May 04, 2014",4.5,"Less Jar Jar = a better rating than TPM, but man some of the droid scenes are gooofy."
"May 04, 2014",3,"Better than Phantom Menace but not by much. Impressive visuals in places. Of course we do get to see Yoda in battle, which prompted fanboys across the country to mark out when this came out in theaters in 2002."
"May 03, 2014",2,"Slightly better than the first, but it has sucky dialogue and jar jar binks."
"May 03, 2014",2,Worst Star Wars in series. Ages 7+
"May 02, 2014",4,"Great movie and much better than episode one. The love story between Anakin and the senator was very good and there were many memorable scenes. The battle scenes were amazing, including yoda's scene at the end. It was cool to see Anakin slowly turn to the dark side. 4/5"
"May 01, 2014",1,"You'll never find a greater hive of scum and villainy than this atrociously boring sequel to the Phantom Menace. Cringe-inducing Christensen had me pining for the glory days of Jake Lloyd, who at least did not have a lame romance with Natalie Portman to suffer through. Nearly unwatchable in its incoherence."
"Apr 29, 2014",1.5,"A lot of people enjoy the prequels, and I respect that. If you love the prequels, awesome. This is just my opinion. Attack of the Clones comes tied up with the Phantom Menace as the worst Star Wars movies. The overabundance of CGI, corny dialogue, boring characters in this movie is disturbing. I really didn't buy into the romance between Padme and Anakin. It felt really forced an dull. The Shakespearean inspired dialogue really made me and friends crack up as we watched it preparing for the release of The Force Awakens. ""You are in my very soul. Your kiss haunts me."" That's actual dialogue from the movie!! The CGI once again was a disappointment. A bunch of digital clones vs. a bunch of digital droids just didn't buy it for me. I miss it when Storm/Clone troopers were played by actual people. What i can say about the movie that was good was the action sequences. I thought that  most of them were exciting and well done. That's about it. Overall, I really, really disliked TPM and AOTC. Possibly some of the worst movies ever."
"Apr 29, 2014",3,"Though, lacking in plotline, original storytelling and reasonable dialogue,  'Attack of the Clones' makes up for this with action, entertainment and imaginative visuals."
"Apr 28, 2014",1,"As a die hard fan of Star Wars, its not fun to say a movie in my all time favorite series sucked so bad. The terribly written dialogue and the overused CGI were the key elements of what made this such a failure in one of the most successful franchises ever. Not only was the film boring, the characters were very unlikable, everything about the plot was sloppily written along with the terribly written dialogue with lines like ""I don't like sand"" and Anakin's rant saying he killed women and children. It was not Hayden Christensen's fault like all the shit he's gotten throughout the years, its just that his character was so terribly written in a painful way. Ewan McGregor is a very talented actor and he was wasted in this film just like in Episode I. The scenes that were supposed to be funny such as when C3PO's head was placed on a droid's body were so unfunny that they made Jar Jar Binks look like Will Ferrell. 95% of the film was filmed in front of a blue screen and the action scenes were extremely overrated. It's an embarrassment for a shitty film like this to be considered a part of the same series as masterpieces like The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi."
"Apr 27, 2014",3,The last 15 minutes sort of makes the rest of the film worth sitting through. Would've benefited from less of the whiny guy we're supposed to believe will turn into Darth Vader.
"Apr 24, 2014",1.5,"In my opinion, even worse than The Phantom Menace."
"Apr 22, 2014",3.5,"Attack of the Clones is a worthy addition to the Star Wars franchise. It doesn't have the power Episode IV did, but it's definitely a good movie for fans or non-fans."
"Apr 21, 2014",0.5,Ruins the Star Wars series. Should be taken out of the Star Wars canon. Enough said.
"Apr 20, 2014",2,"Al igual que su antecesora, se centra en exceso en una subtrama. La diferencia es que, mientras que la primera resultaba fructífera y en cierto modo influenciaba en la trama, la de esta es puro relleno y se excede. Además, los motivos de los personajes protagonistas de esta (la parejita) son sencillamente absurdos. Vale que la película haya mejorado en la acción y muestre cierta intriga y suspense (ejem) en la historia, además de mostrar la parte emocional de Anakin, pero sinceramente, se me hace excesiva. No equilibra y, como contraste a lo anterior, mucho menos exprime todo el potencial que tiene, menciónese los villanos. Para acabar, las actuaciones son olvidables, siendo la de Hayden Christensen la más mediocre. La recomiendo únicamente como espectáculo de efectos especiales, pero no hay nada en concreto apoteósico, digno de mencionar, y el filme no deja de ser un fracaso a mi parecer."
"Apr 15, 2014",3.5,It had large improvement from the last film but lacked what the original trilogy or episode three captured.
"Apr 14, 2014",3,"A little better than episode 1, not much though"
"Apr 13, 2014",4,"An improvement on The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones had a much better cast, good use of CGI and a good storyline. Ewan McGregor was the perfect choice for Ben Kenobi and he fills the role perfectly. What better actor to play the antagonist than Sir Christopher Lee, pure acting genius. The action scenes are a vast improvement on The Phantom Menace including some impressive lightsaber duels. Overall, yes, it was better than its predecessor, but not quite up to the standard of the originals."
"Apr 12, 2014",2,Not the actors fault... its George Lucas and his hatred for fun and sand...
"Apr 12, 2014",2.5,"I experienced Star Wars much later in my life, and I don't think it's as bad as I had always heard. You take young actors and give them miserable writing with terrible direction and this is what you get. Plus of course the blinding CGI everywhere..."
"Apr 11, 2014",2.5,"At times this us the most entertaining new Star Wars, but the whiny excuse for acting and script ruin it."
"Apr 08, 2014",2.5,"The visual effects and action at the end somewhat make up for the ""meh"" dialogue and somewhat stilted acting."
"Apr 08, 2014",2.5,"Attack of the Clones's digital effects are very beautiful to look at, but the weaker writing and Hayden Christensen's poor performance make it the worst Star Wars film to date."
"Apr 03, 2014",2,Worst romantic subplot to ever be put in a movie
"Apr 02, 2014",3,A lot of fun and it's easy to see the intent in everything but bland performances and over abundance of CGI makes it not as easy to enjoy
"Mar 28, 2014",3.5,An improvement from Phantom.
"Mar 27, 2014",3,"The magic's still not back, but Attack of the Clones is more cohesive and entertaining than The Phantom Menace. Technically speaking, the film is excellent, and the action sequences, while mindless, are far more purposeful than before."
"Mar 27, 2014",2.5,"Maybe even worse than Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones once again is another disappointing Star Wars prequel. (C-)"
"Mar 24, 2014",3,"While this movie is nothing special, it was definitely better than the Phantom Menace. While George Lucas has phenomenal ideas he can never really make some work on the big screen. This movie wasn't bad enough to have a negative rating, but it sure was on the edge. This movie did have some great characters but lots of these characters were not presented out in their full potential.  George also brought in a variety of new ships and characters that many Star Wars geeks wiuld recognize. Well most of these characters didn't talk that much and didn't have much of a part it was still good to see them in this movie"
"Mar 22, 2014",2,"Less fun than its predecessors, overlong and poorly acted.
One suspects the filmmakers are biding their time until the next instalment, that this film only exists to tick the obligatory trilogy checklist."
"Mar 18, 2014",1.5,"Easily my least favorite of all the Star Wars films. When I saw it in theaters as an 11 year old, I found it boring. Now that I'm older, I still find it dull, tedious and unengaging - and yet, without the appealing maturity of the original. That's the worst crime a film could commit.
Just to drill in the point even more, I've seen this multiple times and I still can barely tell you what it's about. I've seen Star Wars Episode III *once* and I can give you a reasonable synopsis."
"Mar 15, 2014",3,"An improvement over episode 1, but not as good as the original trilogy."
"Mar 15, 2014",5,"4.5 stars.  

Amazing!"
"Mar 14, 2014",3,"There's no denying that it's better than the first of the prequel trilogy, but it's still not up to the standards of the original trilogy. There's little action and a slightly better plot, but this doesn't mean it's any less pointless."
"Mar 13, 2014",3.5,"When I saw this, I wasn't much of a fan of the Star Wars Saga; in fact, I hadn't even seen the original trilogy, but overall I liked it!"
"Mar 13, 2014",1,"This has to be THE WORST Star Wars movie ever made! What's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING!!! Like its predecessor, it has no clear main character, the dialogue is even worse in this one, the action scenes were nothing exciting, and nothing in it made any sense at all. This movie should have been the perfect time to show Anakin and Obi-Wan's friendship at its best and show what Obi-Wan was talking about in Episode IV. But this movie shows that everything Ben Kenobi told Luke Skywalker in A New Hope was A LIE! From Vader killing his father, to being a good pilot, to being a 'cunning warrior', to being a 'good friend'. All Anakin did in Attack of the Clones was just bitch about Obi-Wan behind his back and hangs out with Padme on this forbidden romance. It was also never explained why the Jedi couldn't get married. IT JUST MAKES NO SENSE! Obi-Wan, meanwhile, goes on these boring missions that are pointless to the ultimate conclusion. The only positive things I would say about it are: John Williams' music score was good, ...um...Natalie Portman's midriff(?), and there was less Jar Jar Binks, but even then (as everyone pointed out), it's all Jar Jar's fault that the Empire was created. FUCK JAR JAR!!! My overall rating is a 2/10. THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!"
"Mar 12, 2014",3.5,Attack Of The Clones is STILL not as good as the original trilogy but STILL does give the excitement Star Wars fans need. And see Yoda fight for the first time
"Mar 12, 2014",4.5,"Remember the happy parade at the end of the previous movie? Where everyone is happy!? Well turns out the Republic forgot about the slaves on Tatooine and this movie is exactly about dealing with this fallout. Maybe the movie could had done a better job at explaining that, but I feel that the point was that everyone but Anakin was too arrogant to admit it.

In a way you could see that Anakin's marriage and fall, is in part due to the guilt of no one caring for the third world Gangster dominated planets like Tatooine.

Obi-wan in a way becomes a Jedi council tool and forgets all of Qui-jon's teachings (along the third world planets, though he does help that drug dealer sorta, but on the Capital Planet). Count Dokuu is introduced as Qui-jon's fallen turned evil Jedi Master and Yoda's former pupil, which explains Qui-jon's defiance towards Yoda and the Jedi council in the previous movie (with Qui-jon being the best of both perspectives).

Of course part of the reason people criticize the movie is that though all this is implicit and meant; the movie doesn't really have time to explore it. And instead leaves it to the imagination. Lucas is too ambitious for his own good.

The most major criticism people have is the clunky cringe romance. But I feel that somehow that is what Lucas meant."
"Mar 09, 2014",3.5,"'Attack of The Clones' is another example of George Lucas's recent attempts of basic storytelling. The vast amount of dry, forced and bad expositions (and dialogs) are one of the film's worst aspects. The characters often have to express and explain their feelings and exactly what they're thinking, even in situations where there's no need for that because we already understand what they're going through. The romance between the main antagonist; Anakin, and the senator of Naboo; Padmé, are at some moments somewhat okay presented, meanwhile in other scenes total rubbish. Romance should be relatable, understandable and wonderful; not forced and non-existing like in this flick. The problem is in the script, it's not the actors fault that for example; the romance didn't work out in a better and more ""The Empire Strikes Back-ish"" way. And speaking of the actors performance's; the cast is very good even though they'aren't perfect. Nathalie Portman has improved in a more nuanced way than in 'The Phantom Menace', where her performance was way too one-dimensional. It's a bit the same with Ian McDiarmid, who continues to impress on the big screen as Palpatine! The main protagonist Count Dooku is a somewhat wise and of course menacing villain, but there's no feeling nor any real depth to him. But is it still a somewhat okay film? That depends strongly on how well you can notice and embrace the flaws. It does have a lot of eye-candy though; like stunning cinematography. Other great aspects are excellent (but sometimes vague) CGI, great scenes of action and intensity, intriguing music and even some artistic moments here and there. But there's still not that much of what the film is supposed to be about; the attack of the clones. Because we continue to see our heroes, sitting in circles, talking with dry and forced dialogs. 

I grew up to this prequel-franchise, and I still enjoy to watch it from time to time. But the flaws are so awful and obvious so my critical viewpoint is overly mad about this flick! 

Personal rating: 70/100 
Critical Rating: 40/100"
"Mar 08, 2014",5,The best from the prequel.
"Mar 06, 2014",0.5,this isn't Star Wars
"Mar 02, 2014",4.5,"A movie that is clearly the most underrated Star Wars movie ever and could be on the list of most underrated movies ever. I see the lack of dialogue and quite bad acting from  Hayden Christensen. Though the characters are fresher than episode one and action is better. The annoying characters have taken a step back and the acting is great. Though this movie would have been a hell of a lot better if they would take out most of that romance shit. Unlike the originals, it was boring and the dialogue was just shit. 
The good thing it does is show yet again a funny C3PO and R2D2, which gives new life in the series. It also establishes themes of the original movies and this shouldn't be taken lightly. Mostly everything about the movie was great and showing Jango Fett was rewarding. My second favorite movie of the series and a clear 9.0/10 for me."
"Mar 02, 2014",3.5,One of the more fun SW films. The Clone Army was excellently rendered. Ignore the romantic scenes. Swallow and move on.
"Mar 01, 2014",3,"Entertainment Monthly: 72% 7.3Though it still suffers from an overabundance of exposition, the action quotient is upped considerably in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, which makes it an improvement over The Phantom Menace."
"Mar 01, 2014",3,"while it improves upon some aspects such as action and story, it weighs it down for me with an annoying romance, an unlikable main character (i just hate anakin as a character, not only because of hayden christensen's wooden performance) and more of jar jar binks. it's got jango fett though, and i have to admit kamino was awesome in this movie. im giving it 3 stars simply because i cant give it 2.75 on rotten tomatoes, however it does, ever-so-slightly improve from the phantom menace."
"Feb 28, 2014",1,I hate this worse than Anakin hates the sand
"Feb 28, 2014",4.5,"Better then the first but still not as good as the 4,5,6"
"Feb 27, 2014",1.5,the worst movie of the series with the most pathetic light saber fight ever seen
"Feb 24, 2014",3.5,a bit better than the one before
"Feb 19, 2014",3,Uneventful but great memory of queuing with my grandma for hours.
"Feb 16, 2014",2.5,"I remember this movie being really boring. I wanted to enjoy the parts with Jango Fett and Boba, but it felt too forced and fake. The whole damn thing feels fake. Hayden Christensen is at his worst here, as is Natalie Portman. I really loved Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. He is pretty damn sinister but it was all just not enough."
"Feb 16, 2014",2.5,"The dialogue is laughable, and the film itself is simply alright, but the Jedi battles elevate the film to an alright level."
"Feb 16, 2014",2,"Spoilers 

After the disappointment that was the Phantom Menace fans were cautious going into Attack of the Clones and well this film was even worse. Attack of the Clones is a terrible movie. The acting is in someways better and in a lot of ways worse. Ewan McGregor is so much better in this film, he has a lot more to do and is quite possibly the best part of this film. Natalie Portman is again okay, her character is very flat and uninteresting but Portman does an okay job.
While Jake Lloyd was really bad, he was a kid so it wasn't really his fault, however Hayden Christensen is absolutely terrible. His line reading is absolutely awful, the scene where he talks about his hate of Tuskan Raiders is painful to watch. His sand speech is also terrible. He does this weird accent in parts, it's so weird. While Hayden Christensen is absolutely awful, no one except for a couple do a particularly great job. Samuel L Jackson is a brilliant actor but here he's so unbelievably bad. He puts no emotion into his peformance, talks and does nothing, then he turns up at the end with his purple lightsaber, beheads Jango Fett and has the creepiest serial killer look on his face. Then you have Christopher Lee, one of the best actors ever, to play the villain and he's barely in the film. He's introduced about an hour in and does virtually nothing. The rest of the cast like last time are all wasted. This film is written and directed by George Lucas and he did a really bad job. The direction in this film is awful, it feels like George Lucas was more interested with cgi than making a good film.
The writing is dreadful, the dialogue is so bad, like I mentioned earlier the sand scene is terribly written as is all the romantic scenes. Speaking of which the romance in this film is one of the worst movie romances ever. Why the hell did Padme fall in love with Anakin? He touches her up, creepily stares at her, then acts like a dick, then he brings a dead body home and tells her how he brutally murdered men, women and children. It such a shit romance and the lines are so corny and made me cringe. The action in this film is also a huge letdown. The chase scene at the start of the film is okay, I like a couple aspects of it but for the most part it's this very glossy overdone cgi mess. There's no tension in this scene as Obi-Wan and Anakin looks so bored and that's because it's all infront of a blue screen. The best action scene in the movie is the Obi-Wan and Jango Fett fight as it's more gritty and doesn't rely on Obi-Wan using his lightsaber. The conveyer belt scene is awful, it's just Anakin twirling around his lightsaber at fake cgi bugs while Padme is in a barrel. The action scene with all the Jedis in the arena should have been amazing and I loved it when I was younger but watching it again it was extremely underwhelming. The fight is very overly cgi and all the actors look very bored as they are all standing infront of a blue screen swinging at cgi droids. The end fight also with Anakin, Obi-Wan and Count Dooku is awful and quite possibly the worst lightsaber battle in all of Star Wars. The fight is very overly choreographed and it's painfully obvious that a stunt double with a cgi Christopher Lee face on is fighting, then Yoda turns up with his mini lightsaber, starts flipping round like a ball, it's just terrible. The action in this film is very underwhelming and that's because there are too many lightsabers, every action sequence has to have someone whip out a lightsaber its so boring, less is more! The cgi in this film is appalling. This film came out in 2002, the same year we got Gollum and wow do the effects in this film look shit. The many cgi characters look awful in this film, especially in the scene where Count Dooku is sitting at a table with lots of alien characters, that scene looks awful. The action scene with the clones vs the battle droids also looks awful. There is so much blue screen in this film and it looks terrible, there are many scenes of characters walking and talking in a blue screen and it all looks shocking. Just like the Phantom Menace this film is really boring, there are just so many long dull scenes that make this film a slog to sit through, this is the longest Star Wars film and it drags, by the time the film ended I was glad as this film is so hard to sit through. The comedy in this film is also dreadful, I think I laughed once at the death sticks scene, which is awful considering the amount of jokes in this film. While this film is terrible there are some good things in the film. The cinematography in the film is great, the shot of Anakin on the speeder bike is beautiful, as is a lot of this film, except for the shots of Anakin and Count Dooku fighting in the dark while twirling their lightsabers around, that looks really bad. The music is great but it's Star Wars, of course the music will be great. Without a doubt though my favourite scene in the movie is when Anakin finds his mother at the Tuskan Raider camp and she dies in his arms, causing him to let his rage get the better of him and kill all the Tuskan Raiders, that's a brilliant and very emotional scene, the only problem is it's too short. Overall Attack of the Clones is a boring and terrible film. I hate it and I don't want to watch it for an extremely long time. D+"

Attack of the Clones suffers a lot of the same problems that plagued the previous film, despite neat special effects that some asshole rendered on his computer. I wouldn't say Hayden Christensen is miscast, and he certainly can act (see Shattered Glass), but given the material in the script and shoddy direction from Lucas, you can definitely tell that he's trying. Ewan McGregor is also well-cast, but again, he too is weighed down by convoluted plotting and shitty lines of dialogue."
"Feb 14, 2014",1.5,"dull, dull, dull and then a green smurf on acid goes nuts for 5 mins (smurf gets 1 star film gets half)"
"Feb 10, 2014",2,"While a slight improvement over Phantom Menace, George Lucas fails again to deliver fans an interesting film. Instead we get a movie with a muddled plot, bad pacing, and antagonist who is not quite fleshed out, even if Christopher Lee does a good job acting. But by far the worst thing about this movie is the extremely wooden acting of Hayden Christensen. Every time Anakin attempts to be romantic or caring it just comes off cringe worthy. The rest of the cast does their best job they can with the script but without good dialog there is only so much they can do. Very disappointing."
"Feb 08, 2014",5,Amazing sequel to the prequel trilogy amazing technology for 2001 to 2002 it still looks amazing today the explosions the action the beginning of the CLONE WARS! Good film with a with mix of romance and war!
"Feb 08, 2014",2,"While it still doesn't live up to the original trilogy, Attack of the Clones is certainly an improvement over The Phantom Meance."
"Feb 05, 2014",3.5,BOOOOOORING Unconvincing romance scenes that just make you stare at the clock mixed with amazing action scenes make this film a mixed bag.
"Feb 03, 2014",3,"The action I do like, but the romance fell flat."
"Feb 03, 2014",2.5,It was good but not the best
"Feb 02, 2014",5,Really awesome movie it's like AWESOME!!!! I LOVE STAR WARS AS HECK ITS MY FAV MOVIE IN THE WORLD
"Jan 30, 2014",3.5,This was a better film over The Phantom Menace because I knew the characters more then the first one and there is once again some wonderful special effects sequences
"Jan 28, 2014",3,"1999's The Phantom Menace had mediocre story, good effects, and mediocre acting, and no really memorable characters. Episode II Attack Of The Clones has even less story, acting, and no memorable characters, but the effects, it has more of. Typical of Lucas."
"Jan 27, 2014",3,The movie was not perfect and there are many flaws that everyone notices but after watching it again many years after the first time I watched it I realized it is a much better movie the story sort of goes all over the place but it makes sense and hayden christisan wasn't as bad as everyone says he is he seemed like a bratty punk but wasn't that the point?
"Jan 24, 2014",4,"Despite suffering from stilted acting and a cheesy love story, Lucas' ""Attack of the Clones"" proves to be a far better film than ""The Phantom Menace"", bolstering with better story elements, more exciting lightsaber battles, and even cooler villains.  What more could Star Wars fans ask for?  A film that harkens back more to the heart-stopping thrills of ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Still, this'll suffice for a'while..."
"Jan 24, 2014",3,The love story never gets off the ground and the dialogue is extra cheesy but impressive visuals and enough fan service keeps this from falling flat.
"Jan 23, 2014",1,"This was always my least favorite. While some things are SLIGHTLY better than the last one, this feels like George is just patting himself on the back."
"Jan 23, 2014",2,The weakest of the Star Wars films is not without any entertainment value but a dull script with uninteresting dialogue combined with a troubling lack of direction make Attack Of The Clones a quite ineffective installment of this great franchise
"Jan 22, 2014",2,"Although people may say this movie wasn't as bad as Episode I, I still rank it with the same problems and also developing new issues as it can be boring, vague, and again focusing on characters that appeal to a completely different crowd, but it is also not a bomb of a movie either, it still pays off with intense and fun aspects..."
"Jan 21, 2014",3,"Star Wars has changed, but it isn't such a bad thing."
"Jan 21, 2014",2,This movie is the purest example of how much of a sellout Lucas had become and only backtracks in the advancement of the prequel trilogy becoming anywhere as good as the originals. Phantom menace was more interesting and Revenge of The Sith improved upon most of the flaws in this film. overall it is the blandest of the films.
"Jan 18, 2014",4,"Pretty cool movie. A lot more action than the first one. (As in, Star Wars Episode I.) Anakin is very emotional in it and you really get to see a lot more of his personality. Lot of flirting and love as well between him and PadmÃ (C). Cool new characters and action with older ones as well as new ones. Get to see how the Clone Wars start and and battles between the clones and the droids. Pretty cool lightsaber battles with different people like Anakin, Obi-Wan and Yoda. Also get to see a lot more Jedi fighting in general with monsters, bounty hunters and droids. It also seems more emotional than the first episode. Obi-Wan is also shown a lot more as a leader and a great Jedi doing a lot of different things and having a lot of new challenges. Anakin's anger is also starting to show having to do with his mother and PadmÃ (C). A pretty good second part to the saga."
"Jan 18, 2014",3.5,"Oh, the plot holes..."
"Jan 18, 2014",3.5,Amazing.Not A Classic But Still Good.B
"Jan 16, 2014",3.5,"*UPDATED REVIEW* Beings my original review was so short, I figured I should elaborate. While yes the Anakin/Padme love interest can be a little cheesy at times, the action sequences are great and the effects are superb. It also serves as great buildup in making Anakin a true tragic hero. I still don't believe it deserves all the hate it gets, but that's how I feel about all the prequel films."
"Jan 14, 2014",0.5,"Story: On one half, Obi-Wan has a bad add story of hunting down Jango Fett. On the other hand, the romance with Anakin and Padme is godawful. Holy shit snacks, I've seen more chemistry between a pine cone and a chair. 
Acting: Ewan McGregor tries his best to make the best out of an awful script. Hayden Christensen blows goats. Natalie Portman is still weak and underdeveloped. 
Visuals: Probably impressive for its time but now, everything looks like it was shot on a Soundstage."
"Jan 13, 2014",0.5,"Half a star is harsh you may think but honestly this film has no redeeming qualities at all. Some the worse dialogue dribbled out of actors who are actually competent performers but here seem to be hit with a full frontal lobotomy and have received a hand inserted to a forbidden area to induce the facial muscles into action, scenes of such chaotic CGI that you simply lose the will to either care or tolerate, a generic plot that's such a cop out for Lucas because of the backlash to  Phantoms coma inducing story and yes that line about disliking sand. Much maligned already I should know better but it should be seen as the sum total of the entire trilogy,A VERY BAD AND POORLY EXECUTED BRAIN FART. Dear oh dear can we be spared the next trilogy?"
"Jan 12, 2014",4,In my opinion I enjoyed this movie! The story and characters are all great. I give this a 4 star rating.
"Jan 12, 2014",2,It's a bad movie that I want so much to love. The romance is wretched. The logic of the story is wretched. Yoda is cool. At least I don't hate it any more.
"Jan 12, 2014",0.5,The worst star wars movie and one of the most boring movies ever!
"Jan 06, 2014",4,"After the first chapter that didn't convince me too much, I liked more this second one. The characters are better delineated and the plot development starts to become clearer also to the ones who doesn't know the story. Also the final battle is of a superior level from the one in the first chapter."
"Jan 04, 2014",2.5,"The issues with the first film are still present in this disappointing sequel. The romance is tedious, the dialogues are awkward and out of place, and Hayden Christensen's acting is laughable."
"Jan 04, 2014",3,"Leggermente meglio del primo, i difetti diminuiscono, ma la storia complicata e poco ritmata rimane. Le scene più' belle (a mio avviso) rimangono le sequenze finali con l'attacco da parte dell'esercito dei cloni e le battaglie a colpi di spada laser."
"Jan 03, 2014",2.5,The Attack of the Phantom Edit is a vast improvement over this version.
"Jan 03, 2014",3.5,Great visuals especially towards the end.
"Jan 03, 2014",1.5,The worst Star Wars movie. The love story between Anakin and Padme single handedly ruins it.
"Jan 01, 2014",5,Replay value   (13)   OWN VHS
"Dec 30, 2013",4,"While it still lacks character development. Attack of the clones is an improvement over The Phantom Menace, thanks to an increase in the action sequences and impressive effects."
"Dec 29, 2013",2,"In this second prequel, Anakin Skywalker is now a young man sharing a forbidden lova affair with Padmé, while the Jedis discover a secret clone army crafted for them. Praised for its technical aspects, shot on digital film and in fact the first major film to have been shot in that style, and with undeniably great special effects and overall visuals. Nevertheless, one cannot forgive a lack of emotional depth in this film. The characters are as two-dimensional can be and thus the performances too end up being cardboard. It's also a little testing to see Jar Jar get so much screen time, after his introduction in the previous film had been bad enough. Arguably the worse in the saga, seems made to upset the original Star Wars fans."
"Dec 27, 2013",2.5,"Attack of the Clones is much more exciting than Phantom Menace, but it's still too long and poorly written/acted."
"Dec 25, 2013",3,The magic has definitely been recaptured.
"Dec 24, 2013",1.5,makes me want to vomit in terror. D
"Dec 23, 2013",3,"On assiste au rapprochement d'Anakin vers le cote obscur, s'en suit le combat final avec les clones. 
Malgre la relation amoureuse Anakin-Padme, le film s'en tire bien mieux que le premier."
"Dec 23, 2013",1.5,"(*1/2  )  (Warning, I've included a few spoilers in this review but I tried to keep them clearly marked.)  Simply the worst movie in the Star Wars franchise, but still a decent stand alone adventure.  First let me address my problem with the title, ""Attack of the Clones.""  Unlike any other of the Star Wars movies, this title does not at all describe what happens in the film.  It misleads the viewer to think that the movie will be about the Clone Wars, when in fact it only sets them up.  SPOILERS --&gt; The clones are the good guys in this movie.  They only appear at the end and are on the side of the Jedi. &lt;-- SPOILERS.  In Empire Strikes Back, the first major part of the movie is the Empire striking back.  In Return of the Jedi, the first scene is the return of Luke to Tattooine to save Han.  This movie leaves all the dirty work to the last and best of the prequels, Revenge of the Sith.

I came back to watch this movie after being so underwhelmed by it as a twelve year old that I never watched it again.  The dialogue between Anakin and Padme which was once boring to me is now just sickening.  They have poorly written lines which Hayden can't even seem to say with any sort of human quality, leading up to some of the most awkward ""romantic"" kisses ever put to film.  Very little happens in this movie at all, aside from pointless action sequences leading to the necessary plot developments Lucas needed to get where he was going in the next movie.  In the end, it feels like it ends in the middle of two acts rather than the end of a film, leaving the viewer with surprise and frustration.  It's just easily the most boring of the bunch.

That said, there are several redeeming qualities.  There are a couple of very good action sequences.  One is where Obi Wan pursues Jango Fett into an astroid belt around a planet, with some really cool sounds and visuals.  The other is the revelation of Yoda's badassery when he arrives to face Count Dookoo.  Some of the plot revelations were also interesting at the time, such as the first look at the coming Death Star plans and finding out the origins of Boba Fett.  Also I applaud Lucas for allowing the audience to decipher the true purpose of the coming Clone Wars by themselves, rather than having an explanation slapped in their face by a villainous monologue.

One more complaint I have is the overall attitude of Anakin in this movie, with every word he says grating on me like salt in a paper cut.  His personality is somewhere between his confident child persona and his evil adult persona, so he's just cocky and annoying, SPOILERS --&gt; with one small flash of evil in the form of his revenge on the Tuscan Raiders. &lt;-- SPOILERS

Overall, this movie lacks what is good in the other two prequels (awesome lightsaber duels and ACTUAL dark, dramatic scenes), but trumps both of them in pointless time-filling action which gets us no where other than into the third movie."
"Dec 23, 2013",3.5,"A huge improvement from the first film due to the increase of action and less on establishing the universe of Star Wars. Though the plot may be cheesy, it did reflect on the old trilogy and bringing new mythology into the saga."
"Dec 21, 2013",5,"Aside from some hammy acting and that awful C3PO ""comic"" relief bit,  the film is a groovy Star Wars romp."
"Dec 19, 2013",4,"One of the weaker entries, but worth watching."
"Dec 16, 2013",1.5,"Once again, it is a fair movie on it's own, but it just doesn't feel like Star Wars, and the love scenes and dialogue make me want to kill someone. But Samuel Jackson, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee don't disappoint."
"Dec 14, 2013",0.5,"Oh J.J. Abrams and Disney, please do a much better job with Star Wars than fox ever could, I mean I know Lucas meant better but... Please just do better than them."
"Dec 13, 2013",3,"Just like the original, there are moments I like and hate. But this one had a little bit more enjoyable momments than the first film had."
"Dec 12, 2013",2,"This movie was almost a disaster.  The plot is unnecessarily complex and difficult to actually care about.  So much hinges on the main character Anakin, yet Lucas decides to put in a lightweight like Christensen.  He is one of the worst actors I have ever seen.  Completely unconvincing as a Jedi.  The character comes across as a whiny spoiled brat with zero redeeming qualities.  The romantic aspect is a flat out dud as the actors have ZERO chemistry, which I fully blame on Christensen.  Even the terrific Natalie Portman cant save it.  There's no way that this film can convince anyone that the level headed intelligent Padme would waster her time around a simple minded dullard like Anakin.  Horrible.  So, the film basically meanders around this weak story until you get to the predictable big battle at the end.  The effects are terrific though."
"Dec 11, 2013",0.5,By far the worst of the Star Wars films. This film is so poorly written that everything that could have been cool about it is just so heavily weighed down by dialogue that makes me want to punch a wall for ten hours. I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate this movie!
"Dec 10, 2013",0.5,At least Phantom Menace had Liam Neeson and a few minutes of awesome at the end.
"Dec 08, 2013",2.5,"Attack of the Clones is a bit better than the last installment and has great action, but still never delivers any story. Christensen was terribly miscast as Anakin, delivering as much personality as a chair. Same goes for Natalie Portman, who generally is a good actress, just not here. The love story was tedious, and the dialogue was poorly written. The effects are good and the final fight between Yoda and Dooku is impressive. Unfortunately, the film crawls along at a snails pace. We have somewhat of an improvement in the story department, but I still couldn't help but feel like the plotting was terribly rushed. The CGI is impressive, but it's almost as if Lucas wants to shove as much of it into one frame as possible. This second prequel is a bit better than the first, yet not still not very good. Star Wars: Episode || - Attack of the Clones gets 2.5/5 stars (C)."
"Dec 08, 2013",1.5,You hear that.........crap.
"Dec 07, 2013",2.5,"The first half of the movie wasn't terrible, then it all crumbled away. The battles at the end are underwhelming, partlyy due to the grandness of their scale. And it didn't help that C3PO was spouting off one-liners throughout. 5.5/10"
"Dec 05, 2013",1,"This movie is horrible. The dialogue is leaden, the narrative is jaded and haphazard, the love story is utterly lacking in nuance or indeed romance, the acting is appalling and the special effects have no physicality. Definitely the worst Star Wars film."
"Dec 05, 2013",3.5,I am a huge Star Wars fan and while this one was better than Episode I it still isn't close to the originals.
"Dec 05, 2013",4,An equally grand movie that depicts the vision of Lucas. I just felt in love with this film series.
"Dec 04, 2013",1.5,"a confusing, rushed plot, pathetically unrealistic duels, and Hayden Chritensen;s note card reading performance. A complete George Lucas mess"
"Dec 01, 2013",1.5,Very poor focus in the wrong spots George was asleep while making this wake up and see your mistakes
"Nov 30, 2013",0.5,"The only good thing about this movie, is that it was better than the first one, which isn't saying much. It would actually be a good film if it had writing, character development and a plot. I love Star Wars and was very excited to see this one. But the forced exposition, the way over-used CGI (a CGI Yoda), and the lack of depth in storytelling left me little to be roused about. The action sequences and the special effects are all top-notch, but because of the tepidness in which they're told you find yourself very uninvested in the outcome."
"Nov 30, 2013",3,"A mix between hardcore action and stunning
CG with ridiculous writing and laughable performances."
"Nov 30, 2013",0.5,"Attack of the Clones has few redeeming qualities to distract from the awkward(ly hilarious) directing and horrible, sloppy writing.  Already protracted sequences linger for pointless reasons, noxious acting poisons every scene, and painfully uninspired plot contrivances riddle the movie like acne on a 13-year-old's face.  Whenever he has an opportunity to liven things up, Lucas instead slows the proceedings to a painfully grinding halt with soap operatic melodrama (which reeks of faux-eroticism to boot) and boring inter-galactic politics.  What's more, Jedi often forget their force abilities whenever the continuation of an action sequence demands it of them.

Anakin's attempted rescue of his mother and the ensuing encounter with the sand people stands out as the movie's one good scene.  The rest of the film lacks any measure of discipline or pragmatism- Lucas just chucks it out the window in favor of covering everything in his Lucas-juice.  Put bluntly, Attack is plain awful.  

It gets a half-star and a *triple snort*."
"Nov 25, 2013",3,"Stronger than the first installment, Attack of the Clones features better character development and an improved story. But that's about it."
"Nov 24, 2013",3,"Better than the first, Portman and McGregor are good, Christopher Lee is a bonus. A solid movie ."
"Nov 21, 2013",2.5,The romance doesn't even remotely live up to the romance in Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.
"Nov 17, 2013",3.5,"Se le puede considerar a esta cinta como el más MEDIOCRE episodio de toda la saga. Abuso de efectos especiales, historia que pudo ser un poco más interesante si no se hubiesen enfocado en tanto romanticismo ridículo, y actuaciones algo bajas de calidad. Sin embargo, al igual que su predecesora, sigue siendo un filme de acción y aventuras bastante fresco y entretenido. Mejora algunos detalles de la primera peli, pero decae más en los suyos."
"Nov 17, 2013",2.5,"Although, its visual effects and its action sequences are gleefully delightful, soppy romance that doesn't even try being realistic or at least interesting and a lead character that whines and complains through half of the film cannot even save the second instalment from total catastrophe."
"Nov 16, 2013",1.5,"It has the same pros and cons that Phantom Menace had, with good action sequences and special effects, but the cringe-worthy dialogue, bad acting, and poor plot bring it down."
"Nov 15, 2013",5,"""Attack of the Clones"" was the first Star Wars film that I ever saw in theaters and was the film that really got me hooked on Star Wars as a kid.  So it is with some bias that I say it is one of the best  of the saga, and is my personal favorite.  Why?

First of all, the action and visuals in ""Attack of the Clones"" are phenomenal and some of the best in the entire saga.  There are so many great, engaging action sequences, all of which have some nice comedy thrown in.  Another great thing is the tone of mystery.  This film is surrounded with mysteries.  Finally, the character development in this film is great, possibly the best since ""A New Hope"" and ""Empire"".  Anakin and Padme especially get a lot of dramatic, emotional moments on Naboo and Tatooine.

The cast of this film gives us spectacular performances.  Ewan McGregor is again fantastic as a mature Obi-Wan Kenobi.  McGregor brings to this trilogy the same kind of charm that Harrison Ford brought to the original.  Hayden Christensen is often cited as the film's biggest problem, but he's not that bad.  He is a bit stiff in the role, but he also gives us a dark, brooding Anakin Skywalker.  Natalie Portman has really grown into the role of Padme, and she and Christensen have great chemistry on screen for the most part.  And even Yoda gets an upgrade in this film, from a puppet to CGI.  As much as I loved the puppet, this was long overdue.

""Attack of the Clones"" is the sum of the best qualities of both Star Wars trilogies.  This movie corrects a lot of the errors ""The Phantom Menace"" made and renews a lot of the fun and humor that the Original Trilogy had.  This is a visually impressive epic that does an astounding job of laying the foundation for future events in the films.  If you are a fan of Star Wars, you will thoroughly enjoy ""Attack of the Clones""."
"Nov 14, 2013",3,"The interactions between Anakin and Padme are horrendous. Still, Jango Fett and the clone wars redeems it for me. But there's still Jar Jar, dang it...oh Star Wars 1-3, what are we going to do with you?"
"Nov 14, 2013",2.5,"The worst executed of the Star Wars movies and the biggest opportunity missed.   I consider this episode and the previous to be bad productions of a fantastic story.   And the prequel story really is far more interesting and dynamic than the story told by the original trilogy, it's just, unfortunately, not told very well.  Anakin Skywalker, the child prodigy of the previous film exploited by the repressive Jedi Order in order to fulfill a prophecy, now has to deal with the inevitable and egregious amount of shame and guilt attendant with the very fact that he has raging hormones.   Rather than teach Anakin to deal appropriately with feelings of attachment and jealousy that often attend loving relationships so that they don't get in the way of his duties and training, the Jedi Council simply forbid the relationships altogether.   This creates within Anakin unnecessary feelings of guilt whenever his natural need for his mother and a female companion assert themselves.   He can't turn to the Jedi to help him free his mother from slavery, because they look down on his ""attachment"" to her.  He can't turn to the Jedi to help him with his relationship with Padme for the same reason.   His last words to his mother as a boy before he was ripped away from her was a promise to one day free her.   When she dies, he sees her death as a failure on his part, and promises at her tombstone not to fail again.  Padme is the only one who lets him know he's just a human being.  She's the only one who talks to him like a human being.  The self-hatred engendered by the Jedi restriction against relationships is ultimately too much for him, so he decides to disobey them and marry her anyway.  This is all set against the backdrop of a galaxy torn apart and on the brink of civil war.  It sounds fantastic on paper and I would love to see that movie.  Unfortunately it was plagued with bad writing, directing and editing.   The music is still fantastic (as always) and the visuals are gorgeous, with some pretty excellent action sequences, even if the final battle was a tad over-saturated (which could have been fixed in the editing).  Ah well, they can't all be gems."
"Nov 11, 2013",2,This movie makes me wants to throw up.
"Nov 10, 2013",1,"By far the worst of any of the franchise including the First Episode, just a bad feeling movie overall"
"Nov 02, 2013",3.5,Yoda vs Count Dooku was epic. I hate seeing the clones. Their existence doesn't make sense.
"Oct 28, 2013",2,"There are some absolutely beautiful effects and some great action sequences but much like Episode I it falls flat in the story and acting departments.  The ""romantic"" scenes between Anakin and Padme make one sick to their stomach with how awfully forced their lines are, there is no chemistry between them whatsoever.  A bit of a shame to see a remarkable actress such as Natale Portman give such a poor performance but even her performance is leaps and bounds above Hayden Christensen's performance which is void of any real emotion or energy.  We can see why Obi-Wan claimed Vader was more machine than man by watching Hayden act as if he were a robot unsure of how to portray human emotion.  Ewan McGregor is excellent as Obi-Wan and does an amazing job of portraying a known character while adding new flare to him.  The addition of the great Christopher Lee was a nice touch but sadly like Darth Maul in Episode I his screen time is very limited. Lucas has a habit of creating interesting villains and then refrains from using them, or he just kills them off without building any character.  Dooku was an interesting character from the information we gather in the film, although his name could have been better.  This film could have been cut down to an hour and a half after cutting out many mindless spaceship flying/landing/taking off scenes, as well as a majority of the stale romance between Padme and Anakin."
"Oct 26, 2013",4,An improvement over The Phantom Menace. Hayden Christensen is annoying is this one though.
"Oct 26, 2013",4,"One of the best in the prequel trilogy. It brang alot to the table with the origin of Boba Fett, the clones, and Anikans dark side. This one is surely one of the greats."
"Oct 24, 2013",2,"F-computer animation they should of used puppets and models like the original star wars, which look far more realistic."
"Oct 19, 2013",5,And again this is also the best movie in the Star Wars Trilogy. And all of the Star Wars movies are good except for Star Wars: The Clone Wars which was a computer animated one and it's kinda stupid because all of the Star Wars movies are distributed by 20th century fox but this one is distributed by Warner Brothers that doesn't really make sense to me.
"Oct 18, 2013",0.5,"Really Really bad movie. Bad acting, bad dialogue, silly."
"Oct 13, 2013",3,"It doesn't have the Star Wars feel to it. It feels like something new, whether that something is a good thing or not will be decided in the next film."
"Oct 12, 2013",1,"All it's got going for it is more jedi backstory and Natalie Portman. I do like Natalie Portman, however."
"Oct 07, 2013",2,"Visually abundant and colorful, ""Attack of the Clones"" marginally surpasses it's crestfallen predecessor, but it still gets lost in some terribly cheesy dialogue and hollow performances."

"Oct 04, 2013",3.5,The least memorable Star Wars movie but still decent because it improves on the first film.
"Oct 01, 2013",3,"I have a tough time deciding whether or not this movie is better than The Phantom Menace. On one hand, I feel like the plot was easier to follow and made more sense in the over-arching story of Anakin Skywalker becoming Darth Vader. On the other hand, this is some of the worst romance ever portrayed on camera. So watching this film now as opposed to as a kid, I now notice the overuse of CGI, the action doesn't impress me as much as it did, the plot made a little more sense but I also was able to truly see how corny and un-romantic the love scenes between Anakin and Padme are. Again, this is a Star Wars movie. A part of my favourite film franchise. For that reason, it's enjoyable to watch. If this was just a generic sic-fi movie that stood on it's own, it would fall flat on it's face."
"Sep 29, 2013",2,"Do I have to say ""anachronisms"" again? Ugh! Why did George Lucas continue to rely on CGI? Besides that, I have to say that the main reasons why I don't like this film very much is because Anakin got ""too angry"", especially when he kills every Tusken Raider (including women and children) in the campsite where his mother died; and I totally disliked the Droid Factory because the machines looked more ""modern"" than the ones in the Original Trilogy. Even though I disliked that part of the film, I loved the part when C-3PO does a ""high-pitched"" scream as the flying robot drops him onto the assembly line."
"Sep 29, 2013",3,A huge improvement over The Phantom Menace.
"Sep 28, 2013",1,"Attack of the Clones is a horrible movie. It's even worse than The Phantom Menace. The effects have improved and it's pretty impressive, especially CGI Yoda (which is better than the puppet in The Phantom Menace but not better than the one from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi). But just like in The Phantom Menace, when real people are in the movie, it looks fake considering the fact that every scene is shot with a blue or green screen around the actors. The score is great as usual (Across the Stars). The biggest problem is the story. The ""LOVE"" story. The love story is horrible. HORRIBLE. It's very unrealistic and stupid. The final battle has so many lightsabers and effects and everything that even though it's enjoyable, it makes your eyes hurt. And the acting... Every character from this movie is very boring and stupid. Even Mace Windu. Obi-Wan has improved, but that's minor. If the characters were written better and smarter and more enjoyable, the actors would be much enjoyable. Except Hayden Christensen. He acts horribly in this movie. He sometimes talks like he's reading when bored.  Even if the movie was written better, Hayden would still suck."
"Sep 25, 2013",3,"The first of the prequels was not a hard act to follow, but does this installment in the prequel trilogy make up for the tremendous train wreck that was the Phantom Menace? For the most part, yes. I say for the most part because I feel like the only way to make up for Episode I in most Star Wars fans', including my own, eyes is to stage a public execution of the floppy eared monstrosity that was Jar Jar Binks (a.k.a. the ""He who shall not be named"" of the Star Wars franchise). But considering that is much more than likely, now that Disney owns the franchise, never to happen, this prequel sequel does the job just fine. I'll start off by saying this is a much darker film than any of the Original Trilogy films and, very thankfully, the precursor to this Episode. This is probably because George Lucas did a bit of over compensating in the mad dash to regain his adult Star Wars audience, i.e. 80% of it, but I certainly can't complain. I definitely needed to see some (SPOLIER) vengeful Sand People beheadings (END OF SPOILER) after the unholy creation of ""He who shall not be named."" There is far more frantic action and adult-themed mystery, such as shadowy Sith influences upon the Separatist rebellion leader, assassination attempts and one laughable forbidden love story spear headed by the gorgeous Natalie Portman and the unbelievably dull Hayden Christensen, who plays the young Anakin Skywalker a.k.a. Darth Vader, which is a rather important role considering these prequels are essentially the story of his rise to greatness and fall to villainy. Christensen is, in my opinion, one of the few draw backs to the second and third prequels as well as the fact that some CGI designer apparently literally put Mr. Lucas' family jewels in a vice to force him to continue to include ""He who shall not be named"" in the films. One of the monumental improvements in this film is the addition of CGI Yoda, who was one of the only CGI characters I thoroughly enjoyed, especially when he puts the green lightsaber to work in one of the most comically thrilling and enjoyable parts of the movies. The main villain this time around is (SPOILER) Count Dooku a.k.a. Darth Tyranus played by Christopher Lee, who does a fine job in the role (END OF SPOILER) Ewan McGregor and Sam Jackson as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu respectively are back to strike, this time with far more well deserved screen time and the lightsaber fights are as good as ever. I'm giving Episode II a 3/5 simply because one of the main characters is played by a brick wall, I mean fine young actor with merely a few missing bits in the talent section and the fact that ""He who shall not be named"" made his cringe-worthy return. Other than that, it's a fine film. For Slightly More Appeased Star Wars Fans United, this is The Truth You Can't Handle, signing off."
"Sep 23, 2013",1,"Underwhelming, to say the least. It would be utterly forgettable if not for the Star Wars name."
"Sep 22, 2013",3.5,"Just like Phantom Menace this one was a bit lackluster in the story, but the action scenes, especially the end scene, were amazing.  It was awesome to see Yoda finally fight! The Kamino City looked amazing and so did the other settings of the movie but it was not enough to place it up there with the great Star Wars films."
"Sep 21, 2013",2,"I have determined that the prequels are all failures because they are one film dragged out over three movies. Hayden Christensen is awful, the romance between Portman and Christensen lacks chemistry, and the plot is sub-par. The only redemption is the film's artistry in set design and costumes, which continue to please while the script continues to flunk. Rent it, don't buy it, and if you're under twelve with no expectations from movies but lasers, you'll love it."
"Sep 19, 2013",3.5,great movie not so sure about 3D though
"Sep 15, 2013",3,Hayden Christiansen's lousy acting and clunky romance story detract from an otherwise engaging film.
"Sep 11, 2013",3,"The story goes on, but not the magical movie experience. It got it's tense moments intact and it's an entertaining ride. Sadly the earlier funny stuff fails and it gets rather silly at times. Anakin is looking like a Justin Bieber of some sort and some fighting scenes are a bit overkilled. Portman looks smashing but this film is not about the pretty stuff. Now I just hope that the (so far) last film will make some sort of completion, that the last one will leave me a bit happier. This film is not crap, it's Star Wars, but not Star Wars at it's best.

6.5 out of 10 Star Wars."
"Sep 09, 2013",2.5,"Slightly better than I, it is must see from the standpoint of the story ark. Like I it is made in a grand epic cinorama style, which means timing of certain elements seems slow and at times clunky. Jar Jar has a diminished role, thankfully,  but is still an occasional disruptive element and Annikin is frequently whiny, which is wearing."
"Sep 09, 2013",4,"I know everyone says the prequel trilogy sucks, but this was actually entertaining, and was an improvement over The Phantom Menace."
"Sep 09, 2013",1,"Attack of the Clones is a boring, bad-scripted, awfully acted light-saber stravaganzza looking to make ties to the original trilogy so HARD it's borderline ridiculous."
"Sep 08, 2013",2,"Although it may be more funner than its predecessor in just about every aspect, it tends to get lost in romantic relationships and loses a great sci-fi story value of previous Lucas flicks."
"Sep 08, 2013",3.5,"Yes! This is so much better than Phantom Menace, but after the Original Trilogy, this doesn't even scale anywhere near as close. It is disappointing, but also a very good film. I think the best thing about this film is that we see Anakin begin his turning into Darth Vader. Very clever scripting and writing there."
"Sep 07, 2013",3,The better of the prequels.
"Sep 05, 2013",5,One of the best movies of all time.
"Sep 05, 2013",1,Just a wreck of a movie. The 3D will only make it worse
"Sep 05, 2013",2.5,"Attack of the clones is a better film than Phantom Menace, but still suffers from the same script related difficulties"
"Sep 04, 2013",2,Better the Episode I but still does not match the original. Love story was forced and silly.
"Sep 04, 2013",2,"With slightly better management over its pacing and execution and a small improvement on its storytelling, Attack of the Clones still underperforms with a very forced and materialistic romance, illogical plot structures and dialogue, a bloated third act, and characters with shifting traits."
"Sep 04, 2013",3.5,"There's absolutely no chemistry to be found between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman: too many scenes are devoted to them which don't benefit the film, or the audience, in any way. All that aside, Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a very entertaining movie."
"Sep 03, 2013",4.5,The Yoda fight at the end is worth the admission price alone.
"Sep 03, 2013",2.5,"An improvement on the previous film, though not by much, Clones still suffers from most of The Phantom Menace's problems. Although thankfully there's no Jar-Jar or child Anakin, more Senate scenes and Anakin moaning to Padmé (an agonising secondary plot, despite this supposedly being a trilogy about Vader's origin) make it mostly slow and uninvolving. However where this film does succeed (as do the other prequels) is showing the vast scale of the galaxy in the way Lucas always intended, and this is most obvious in the Clone Wars - thousands of clones in battle is entertaining, but you have to sit through the rest of the film to see them.
Mediocre."

"Sep 02, 2013",3,"Again, guilty pleasure for the action."
"Sep 02, 2013",1,"Ugly-looking, awfully-acted, and terribly written. Star Wars: Episode II takes all the hideous and boring parts of Phantom Menace and somehow makes them the entirety of the film, while simultaneously making it all worse. The lightsaber duels are cool, but far too over-choreographed and have no sense of weight to them. And then there's the obnoxious and nearly unforgivable overuse of CGI. All around a bad film, and the worst the Star Wars series has to offer."
"Sep 01, 2013",4.5,This movie was exciting full of action great special effects.  Everything I expected from a star wars movie.
"Aug 31, 2013",2.5,"While 'The Phantom Menace' is generally considered the chink in the chain, I have to disagree, and instead point that accusation at this one.  Firstly, however, I do still like this film - it's Star Wars, after all - but when putting it up against the other five (yes, even 'Episode One'), this is definitely my least favourite.  It has an awesome beginning - with the unexpected assassination of Padme's decoy; and then the overblown but entertaining chase through the underbelly of Coruscant.  The final battle is also magnificent, starting right at that point when the Jedi reveal themselves in the crowd amongst that giant amphitheatre - that part gives me shivers every time.  Unfortunately, its literally everything that happens in between these widely separated parts.  I don't know if anyone's noticed, but George Lucas isn't very good at making riveting drama.  And especially when both Christensen and Portman give such bland performances, the fact that 80% of this film centres around their budding romance is, ultimately, what kills it.  Perhaps 'Attack of the Clones' is a little darker, a little smarter, a little more ""grown up"".  But at least stuff actually happened in 'The Phantom Menace'; at least that one had a sense of adventure and mysticism; at least it wasn't as goddamned boring as this long-awaited sequel turned out to be."
"Aug 31, 2013",0.5,Easily the worst movie I've ever seen.
"Aug 29, 2013",2.5,"I have a hard time deciding whether this or Episode 1 is worse. The first 2/3 of this movie are pretty rough- romance scenes with Anakin/Padme are so horrendous I had to cover my ears and close my eyes, the acting and dialogue are unbearable. The side quest with Obi-wan investigating is interesting and much better than the Anakin/Padme storyline. Still, that story thread never resolves or goes anywhere (Syfo Dias ordered the clones? But Tyrannous hired Jango? The Kamino people were expecting Obi-Wan's arrival??). The final act of this movie is superior to the Phantom Menace in every way, the arena beast battle is pretty cool, and then the entire Jedi order showing up to fight together is easily the best part of this movie. The subsequent clone/droid battle is also cool, but the Obi-wan/Anakin vs Dooku battle is horrendous, with almost nothing but close ups of Christopher Lee or a poorly concealed body double. Yoda vs Dooku is really cool, although a bit cheesy. One thing this movie does well is leave you excited for the next chapter. All the pieces are set in motion- Palpatine is more powerful than ever as Chancellor, the Jedi are clueless to him being a Sith Lord, Anakin is shown to have dark/violent inclinations, and the massive army is introduced that answers to Palpatine. But along with Phantom Menace most of it still feels like a placeholder for the real story to happen (Revenge of the Sith). Although this movie has many more cool moments than Menace, I find the Anakin/Padme drama even more unbearable than Jar-jar."
"Aug 27, 2013",0.5,"How does 3D'ifying it make it any less awful? Now we get to suffer through the horrendous ""laughing merrily in the flowery fields"" scene but in 3D. Let's assume that 3D is the only 'depth' to this ""love story."""
"Aug 25, 2013",4,Complain all you want about this movie but in the end I will still like it. Sure it's a little cheesy but the plot really isn't that bad and the last half hour of the movie is pretty fantastic.
"Aug 23, 2013",1.5,"If you ever wanted to see a romantic movie in the Star Wars universe, this is it. Otherwise it's just a reminder how low a franchise can fall..."
"Aug 22, 2013",5,It was awesome. 1b or whatever they call themselves they are obviously going in the wrong direction as a ******* gay boy band.
"Aug 22, 2013",0.5,Lucas on Crack take 2.
"Aug 20, 2013",3.5,"I have mixed feelings about this. I'm an avid Star Wars fan, and own every movie on VHS, DVD, Blu Ray, and saw all 6 in theaters at some point. This is a story that can't be missed by fans, but it is so horrible in the writing and acting department, that you'll own it, but it will never have any replay value except for action scenes. Hayden Christiansen comes off as whiney, know it all, and hardly resembles a Jedi Knight even as far as apprentice. This is a disservice to the Darth Vader character, and if any friend or family wants to see a Star Wars flick, you'll probably take out A New Hope or Empire and rewatch those fifty times, then Jedi, then say, do we really want to see the trilogy again. Needless to say, its required reading for a fan, and is at least enjoyable."
"Aug 19, 2013",3,"Good movie, great action, and epic visuals. George Lucas does great job of of bringing these movie to life. Not the best in the series but it is still very entertaining."
"Aug 16, 2013",2,"Do you know what I would have liked to see from &lt;i&gt;Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones&lt;/i&gt;, the fifth film in the franchise? Something entertaining. This is the first of the series that was dull, and I have no idea why. So much of it was made with computers that it almost feels like an animated film. And yet, it seems the creativity is all but gone for most of the experience. As a result, we have people sitting around fake-looking rooms talking about nothing of importance for the vast majority of its running time. Boring.

&lt;i&gt;Attack of the Clones&lt;/i&gt; begins a full decade after the last film ended, apparently because there's no need to rush anything. Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is now the apprentice to Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and the pair act like a couple out of a buddy cop movie. In fact, the initial chase sequence -- one of two highlights we're provided -- plays out like a less daring &lt;i&gt;Rush Hour&lt;/i&gt;. The pair crack wise, don't listen to one another, but succeed in their aims. It takes place in a magically rendered city.

They're separated soon after. Obi-Wan is tasked with tracking down someone who tried to kill now-Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman), while Anakin has to protect the woman who was so nice to him when he was a wooden little child. Of course, you could have predicted in &lt;i&gt;The Phantom Menace&lt;/i&gt; that he and Padmé would eventually fall in love, and so they do. They play out a terrible romantic drama for a good 45 minutes or so, which is where much of the tedium in this &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; comes from.

All the while, the Jedi council, which apparently consists of a now full-CGI Yoda (voice of Frank Oz), Master Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), Obi-Wan and nobody else of importance, meets and tries to decide what's best for everyone. There isn't even a villain or even a great danger until about the last third of the film; people just sit around, ominously talking about things that may or may not ever happen, and then we get a relatively exciting final battle scene to wrap it all up.

The pacing is off, and for the first time in the franchise, I was often dozing off while it was playing. It doesn't help that the only interesting character, Obi-Wan, is the only one who doesn't get a whole lot of dramatic moments. He's off chasing a bounty hunter named Jango Fett (Temeura Morrison), and therefore doesn't get to do anything as a character. Anakin and Padmé talk a whole lot, but they're so underwritten and underperformed that nothing they talk about is worth listening to. The Jedi council would be fun if they had reason to meet, but it seemed to be there mostly so the non-puppet Yoda could be shown off as often as possible.

This is also the first time I thought that there were too many special effects, and that the focus was more on them than anything else. Seemingly everything in the movie was created digitally. Sets that would have been actually made years earlier were whipped up in a computer, and the technology hasn't advanced enough for that to always work. At times, it looks fake -- fake enough to draw your attention away from the movie and onto its craftsmanship.

Some more world-building does happen in this film, and a few more incidents and characters are set-up for the ""main"" trilogy, but there's absolutely no reason for it to all be this boring. And there isn't even a whole lot that is established in this one that we didn't already know. Why Boba Fett gets involved in later years is brought up, and we see that one of the characters has plans drawn up for a primitive Death Star, but these take a few moments, not more than two hours.

&lt;i&gt;Attack of the Clones&lt;/i&gt; also starts to show us how Anakin descends into darkness. Although that's not really what happens. There's a bit of that, but mostly he's just shown as disrespectful and more like a teenager than a young adult. He feels Obi-Wan is holding him back, and sure, that might be the case, but the way he disregards orders and does his own thing just makes him so unlikable. We're supposed to be rooting for this guy at this point, right? I found that difficult.

It's not helped that he's been played by stiff actors for the last couple of movies. You can kind of excuse it the last time around, as Jake Lloyd was really young. What's Christensen's excuse? Does he have no grasp on the character? Was he given no direction? Many of the actors are poor, so I almost think that might have been the case. George Lucas directed this installment and seemed so transfixed on the special effects that, to him, it might not have mattered what the actors were doing.

&lt;i&gt;Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones&lt;/i&gt; is the worst of the &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; franchise for a few reasons. It looks fake -- even more so than the original which was made in the '70s -- it is dull for the majority of its running time, it has no characters worth following or caring about (despite giving them a ton of time to sit around and talk), and it has actors who look lost in front of the green screen behind them. The effects are the focus and they're not good enough, for the most part, to be the spectacle that is needed to make them the star."
"Aug 16, 2013",1,Worst movie in the series. Seriously when I was younger I at least kinda liked 1 and 3 but even then I knew this one sucked.
"Aug 15, 2013",1,Shows what would of happened if Ed Wood would of had an unlimited budget
"Aug 15, 2013",2,"Better than the Phantom Menace but has some terrible script writing. Boring wooden characters. No one you can relate to, and a bunch of symmetrical references to the original trilogy."
"Aug 12, 2013",2.5,"This one almost made it to my list of decent films.  After the travisty that was Episode One, I expected more of this film.  Instead I only got more of the same.  Bad acting, unbelievable relationships, inconsistancy in the lore, mediocre swordplay and the inclusion of characters for no other reason than the fact that they were popular in Episodes 5 and 6.  Never the less, the worst thing about this movie is anything that tries to show a relationship between Anakin and any other character in the film.  Without those scenes it would at least make my list of decent films...but still not make it above Episode 3."

"Aug 06, 2013",1.5,Awful. Just awful. It's like George Lucas threw a bunch of fanfic scripts in the air and then turned in the first 100 pages he picked up as the script. I'm going to watch Empire 200 times in a row in an attempt to purge my memory of this abomination to the Star Wars franchise.
"Aug 06, 2013",1,The boy is a whiny bitch
"Aug 06, 2013",3.5,"This was a pretty good one. Though I wasn't the biggest fan of making all the Clone Troopers CG and felt that hiring a couple hundred equally tall bodybuilders would have been cheaper, I see it as a big improvement over its predicessor and it has aged better.

"Aug 01, 2013",2,"I know a lot of people Love  to point their fingers at The Phantom Menace for being the worst of the series for obvious reasons, But you know what it did at least have some redeeming factors to it. 
Now if you ask me, I say the Worst of the series is Attack Of The Clones.
 With exception of a few memorable performances by Ewan McGreggor &amp; Christopher Lee, And John William's Great Music. Redeeming Qualities for this one are very few. 
The CGI &amp; Blue Screen Effects have Aged Worse then the Effects in its predecessor, the so called ""Acting"" and Dialog is at an all time low, and even as A Kid I hated the Anakin / Pademe Romance ( I can Tolerate Jar Jar just fine). 

In The End I by no means Hate this Movie, I just don't think its Held up well At All, Unlike The Amazing Originals.

"Jul 22, 2013",5,"For me this probably the weakest Star Wars movie but I love for my own reasons. First of all, the story is very modern relating with military and politics like The Phantom Menace.

"Jul 18, 2013",2.5,"Bad dialogue, no classic Star Wars feel, but this time Lucas added bad CGI and a green screen. At least the action is more entertaining."
"Jul 17, 2013",3.5,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones, improves greatly over The Phantom Menace, but it is still very far away of the rest of the episodes thanks to a very slow and boring pacing."
"Jul 17, 2013",3,"lots of of love.i like retun of the jedi better
bu still good"
"Jul 16, 2013",3,"Overall it's an okay movie. Apart from the John Williams score, it didn't even feel that much like Star Wars. Anakin's acting is terrible, CGI is over used and the dialogue is very mediocre."
"Jul 16, 2013",3.5,"I love starwars!!!, all tho this is my least favorite of the current 6 it was still an amazing movie"

"Jul 14, 2013",1,TRASH...makes me so sad.
"Jul 14, 2013",3,"Better than The Phantom Menace but very far from the successes of Revenge of the Sith, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Introduces aspects that are featured in the original trilogy such as Stormtroopers, the moisture farm on Tatooine and Boba Fett."

"Jul 14, 2013",5,The 3rd best movie of Star Wars that I love
"Jul 13, 2013",3,The weakest film of the trilogies.
"Jul 11, 2013",2,Esta secuela toma los pocos aspectos rescatables que tenía su predecesora... y los elimina. También toma lo malo de la anterior... y lo vuelve peor. El peor episodio de Star Wars.
"Jul 11, 2013",0.5,"How could this possibly be worst than Episode 1!!! Perhaps the worst movie of all time, Episode 2 makes episode 1 look like...Episode 4!!!"
"Jul 10, 2013",1.5,The worst of the prequels. This movie is boring and the acting is unbearable. The only good thing are the few well crafted action scenes but there aren't that many.
"Jul 10, 2013",2.5,Thankfully a lot less Jar Jar but unfortunately there is Hayden Christensen carrying on the tradition of a dreadful actor playing a major role.
"Jul 10, 2013",2.5,"Star Wars Episode II is a decent Star Wars film, but you just have to get past Hayden Christensen's Zombie-like acting."
"Jul 09, 2013",2,Ok it is not the best star wars move but its ok
"Jul 08, 2013",2.5,Further needless story expansion that is not as interesting as some would think.
"Jul 06, 2013",4.5,Hayden Christensen did really good
"Jul 06, 2013",3,"If you cut out the Anakin and Padme parts, this is great."
"Jul 06, 2013",2,"Grade - C-
Probably the worst of all the prequels, 'Attack of the Clones' has terrible performances and cringe-worthy dialogue; even if it does contain some fun action sequences."
"Jul 06, 2013",3.5,"16 years after the release of Return of the Jedi, George Lucas brought Star Wars back onto the screen with The Phantom Menace. Though it unsurprisingly made a boatload of money, the movie was met with a lukewarm response. While it did introduce the Star Wars universe to a new generation, it alienated a large portion of the series existing fans. 3 years after The Phantom Menace, Lucas offered audiences Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. While there definitely are some glaring problems with this sequel, it is an improvement over the last movie, and it sends the series in the right direction.

Roughly 10 years after the events of The Phantom Menace, a Separatist movement against the Republic has sprung up. The movement is headed by former Jedi Knight, Count Dooku. Padmé Amidala is now a senator, and she has returned to Coruscant to vote on a plan to create an army for the Republic to assist the Jedi against the Separatist threat. Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and his now young adult apprentice Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect Padmé. When Obi-Wan leaves Coruscant to investigate a planet called Kamino, Anakin and Padmé travel to back to Naboo for safety. While Obi-Wan discovers a shocking secret on Kamino, Anakin and Padmé fall in love.

Let me get to negative aspects out of the way first. The romance in this movie is laughable. Lucas doesn't write anything close to a legitimately romantic line. If anything, the dialogue between Anakin and Padmé is straight up creepy. The movie is full of these creepy, ""romantic"" lines but this exchange takes the cake:

Padme - ""Please don't look at me like that.""
Anakin - ""Why not?""
Padme - ""Because it makes me feel uncomfortable.""
Anakin - ""Sorry my lady.""

The dialogue is awful in these scenes. But so is the whole romantic subplot really. The rest of the story in this movie is very interesting. But sadly, the movie repeatedly cuts away from the meat of the story to show us Anakin and Padmé falling in love in a beautiful meadow in Naboo.  This is definitely the weakest element of the movie.

The other thing that bugged me was the ridicules action scene in the coliseum with Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Padmé fighting gigantic beasts. It's just a CGI overload where the characters take a back seat to the effects. It's a shame, because the other action in the movie is very strong.

But in most ways, this movie is surprisingly strong. I love the visual aspect of the movie, especially the scene on Kamino. The whole design of that world is stunning. The action is very solid in this movie. Right out of the gate, we get a very entertaining chase through Coruscant. The next highlight is the action scene in and around Kamino. Jango Fett proves to be an awesome character, and is given his best moments in this scene. The last action scene in the movie is also spectacular. The lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan, Anakin, Yoda, and Count Dooku may not be as good as the duel from Episode 1, but it still is impressive. It's a treat to finally see Yoda unsheathe his lightsaber.

Ewan McGregor returns as Obi-Wan Kenobi. He takes up some of the characteristics that Qui-Gon Jinn left behind. This is a closer incarnation of the 1977 character. McGregor is a constant in this entire trilogy. You can always count on him to deliver a solid performance. There are moments in this movie where McGregor is absolutely wonderful as the wise Jedi. And in the next movie, he really comes into his own.

Hayden Christianson picks up right where Jake Lloyd left off at the end of last movie...in that he is pretty terrible.  All things being considered, I think Christianson's performance here is worse than Lloyd's. It was unfair to expect anything more from Lloyd, but there no excuse for Christianson's performance. As I mentioned before, the romance is terrible. He delivers his lines in this obnoxiously whiny manner. While there are some hints at a good performance scattered throughout the movie, Christianson is largely horrible.

Natalie Portman is stuck with terrible material, and therefore a fairly terrible performance. If her character wasn't the focal point of the appalling romantic plot line, then her performance would have been much better. It's a shame to waste Portman's abundant talent with terribly written dialogue.

The supporting cast members all perform admirable. Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Ian McDiarmid round out the cast with solid performances. 

John Williams returns to score his 5th Star Wars movie. He once again provides excellent music, new and old. The Imperial March is finally used in full, right after Anakin's dark deed on Tatooine. He provides a new theme, a love theme for Anakin and Padmé. It's a gorgeous piece, but it is a bit overused in the movie. While it's not William's best Star Wars effort, it's certainly solid.

Attack of the Clones is a confident step forward for the Star Wars franchise. It fixes some of the issues from The Phantom Menace, but also introduces a few of its own. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, outside the romantic subplot (which is sadly quite large). I understand the importance of establishing Anakin and Padmé's romantic connection, but the execution is very poor. But the whole Clone, Jango Fett, Count Dooku aspect of the story is very well done and entertaining. About half of this movie is better than empty thrills of The Empire Strikes Back, but the other half does weigh down the story considerably. A step in the right direction? Yes. But still a work in progress.

""Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me?"" 7/10"
"Jul 04, 2013",2.5,George Lucas took a giant diarrhea shit all over his art.
"Jul 02, 2013",1,"Terrible(shaking head), just terrible."
"Jul 01, 2013",3,"This is better. For the most part, Episode II: Attack of the Clones, is more satisfying and enjoyable than Episode I, even though there are still some big problems with it. First, the good stuff: Ewan McGregor comes into his own as Obi-wan Kenobi and is starting to feel a little more like Sir Alec Guiness and his older Kenobi from the original trilogy. Free of all the makeup and rigid dresses and dialogue from Episode I, Natalie Portman here is able to be a real person, a rarity in the prequels thus far. And finally, newcomer Hayden Christianson does his best with a feeble script and embarrassingly bad romantic dialogue between him and Portman. And that's the bad: the written dialogue of this movie is sometimes so bad, it makes good actors look bad, which is unforgivable. Also bad is the ridiculous scene where my beloved Yoda, now a digital effect instead of a real and believable puppet, gets into a lightsaber duel with Christopher Lee's Count Dooku and starts bouncing around like a rubber ball. Everytime I watch this scene, I can visualize the Yoda I knew from the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi facepalm and shake his head sadly.
And that's the general tone of not only this film, but all the prequels: it's hard to see the forest for the CGI trees."
"Jun 30, 2013",3.5,"Regardless of what many say about summer blockbusters and their purported inability to reach the higher realms of movies, one thing they are quite successful at where other types of movies generally fail is in leading up to a superior sequel. Following the release of the first entry in the Star Wars prequel trilogy (no more comments need be made on that) the wait began for its inevitable sequel, which was released after a 3 year production. Needless to say, the general reaction was lukewarm at best and even stirred a rather amusing debate over which of the two prequels is more inept. What I found was something that not only improved on ""The Phantom Menace"" but also helped me understand some important things about sequels. 

As reluctant as I am to admit it, this is the installment that actually rejuvenated my interest in the Star Wars franchise. From the moment I saw the first teaser trailer, which I consider one of the best ever, I had great anticipation for this movie and was motivated to learn all that I could about the premise and characters beforehand. This was the first time I really got excited about a sequel. 

Regarding the story of the film, we are all familiar with it so there is no reason for me to waste time summarizing it. Very much like its predecessor, ""Attack of the Clones"" tells a rather simple one, but in its own line this is probably one of the more involved narratives, with a heavier focus on political agendas and things of the sort. Many have reviled it for this on the grounds that, again, such things do not belong in a Star Wars film, which I will admit is a valid concern. However, there are two things that I feel need to be pointed out. First, it is quite difficult to imagine this part of the story being done in another manner, given that one purpose of this trilogy is to chronicle the transformation of the old system into the Empire from the original films. These elements had to eventually be included because the story is told from the point of view of the old system. The original films did not need this because they were told from the perspective of the rebels, and it is easy to accept rebels not concerning themselves with these types of things, especially against a dictatorship. Second, there are some unique things to appreciate. For example, I liked how there is a sort of murder mystery likeness to it, with Obi-Wan investigating the attempted assassination of the Padme character. It plays out in a manner not seen in any of the other films and leads to some intriguing developments. 

Placing a large time gap between this film and the previous one was a good move, as it fully conveys to the audience that many things have changed. A new crisis has arisen and some distrust between the jedi and politicians is revealed. Beyond that, it also helped just seeing how much the 3 key players had changed over the course of 10 years. Even though they are played by some of the same actors as last time, they come across as much older and more mature, one example being obvious and the other two more subtle. This I think is one of the simple delights of sequels, to just become reacquainted with familiar people, although I found it to be done particularly well here. 

But, the part of the story that inspired the most ire is the romantic subplot. George Lucas, as he has admitted, is a weak writer of dialogue, a fact made worse when dealing with a romance. Many of the scenes between Anakin and Padme lack the spark that was present in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", dragged down all the more by uninspired lines and remarks, admittedly bringing about some unintentional chuckles. It is all sincere and honest, traits that are severely lacking in more modern romances, but is not presented very competently. It does little more than what it is supposed to do: show why something like this ended up happening. Even so, there are a few things here that I did appreciate. For one, it is nice to see Natalie Portman be given more to do and overall show a more proactive side to her character. There is actually a nice moment, right before the group sets off to save Obi-Wan, when she takes control of the situation and Anakin gives her this look that might as well say, ""And that's why I married you"". Sure, they are not a couple at this point, but you know what I mean. I even liked a few of the exchanges they had, especially the brief one during the arena battle that referred back to a conversation they had earlier. Beyond that, Lucas should be given credit for devoting time to bringing substance to this. Sure it is has many faults, but at least there is something to it. When the three films are seen together, it is kind of neat to see how the relationship between the two pertinent characters evolves, as opposed to the romances in the Lord of the Rings trilogy that were mostly static and unsubstantial. Regardless of what anyone says, this is not one of the worst romances brought to the screen; I have seen much worse. Take a gander at ""Mean Girls"", ""Watchmen"", ""Failure to Launch"", ""The Fantastic Four"", ""The Graduate"", ""Transformers 2"" or ""Can't Hardly Wait"", just to name a few. 

The rest of the cast continues with their mostly stiff performances, on average delivering their lines with arguably less enthusiasm than in The Phantom Menace. Combining this problem with the greater emphasis on political matters robs the movie of some of the excitement and dramatic elements that are expected from a film in this franchise, but thankfully this fault is less prominent amongst the 3 leads, who demonstrate a dynamic that has changed since the previous movie. Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee are the two standouts that are not digital, with the former coming closer to what Alec Guinness brought to the role and the latter possessing elegance and sophistication that is a refreshing change of pace from other Star Wars villains. Interestingly, the digitally created aliens, some of which only appear for one scene, have a tendency to outperform their human counterparts. Such examples of this include Watto, Dexter (who appears in a scene that is a nod to American Graffiti), the Kaminoans and, of course, the venerable Yoda.  

It puzzles me why people regard the use of CGI in The Phantom Menace as overkill, even though the movie had many organic settings and some familiar set design. Attack of the Clones can rightfully be accused of that, since it contains many fully animated settings, including the Jedi Temple, Geonosis, and Kamino. Granted, some of these are well done and convincing, but mixing it up a little more would have been beneficial. Also, this contributed to the actors not acting properly within their intended environments. It is difficult to react to something that is really not there, but as King Kong proved in 2005 it is possible. However, it is difficult not to admire the attention to detail that went into some of the animation. I particularly liked the many subtleties that helped bring the CGI Yoda to life, such as the slight twitching of his ears, and the changing of city districts during the early chase.

Despite some of these hiccups, Attack of the Clones still manages to be good entertainment, mostly due to its opening and closing acts. The speeder chase is suitably thrilling and reveals something of the recklessness that Anakin was known for in the original films, culminating in a tavern sequence that might as well be a throwback to film noir. The final 40 minute battle sequence was possibly the most well-conceived in the franchise at the time, with creatively done creature battles, a massive conflict outside the arena and another unique lightsaber duel that ends up being more stylistic than the previous one. The final few scenes are also effective and give a bleak glimpse of future events, aided by John Williams' always compelling music. 

This was a step forward for the prequel trilogy, revealing the origins of many important things from the established Star Wars mythos that included the imperial stormtroopers, the Death Star and even what the once barely mentioned Clone Wars were all about. Many of the same faults from The Phantom Menace remain, but Attack of the Clones amounts to a perfectly entertaining space opera.

Side Note: I recommend watching this movie with the audio commentary on."
"Jun 30, 2013",2,Visually stunning but obsurdly boring
"Jun 28, 2013",3,"You know, when it wasn't focusing on the horrific romance, this movie wasn't half bad."
"Jun 27, 2013",3,"Not the best, but better than Episode 1"
"Jun 26, 2013",3,"Its title conjures thoughts of epic battle scenes, but with the exception of the last 30 minutes and a few chase sequences, the remainder of the film is a tedious romance."
"Jun 26, 2013",3,Want a good as the first episode but I still enjoyed it at times. The couldn't really keep me entertained in this one. The title of the movie intrigued me but the only real battle ws at the end of the film which disappointed me. I would watch it again if I had to
"Jun 25, 2013",4,This movie is great just as good as the the prequel
"Jun 24, 2013",1.5,"I was very reluctant to re-watch this movie because I literally have no good memories with this one, or any memories of it at all. That's the film's biggest problem, you can't recall anything in it, it's kind of just ""there"". Just sitting there, doing absolutely nothing. I feared it would be just as terrible and awful as any other Star Wars fan said it was, but to be honest, I didn't think it was that terrible to sit through. 

Now, don't get me wrong. This film was bad, like... REALLY bad, but the writing was so tremendously awful that I found it really entertaining. It's not like ""Phantom Menace"" where it's sometimes bad and sometimes good. Instead it's sometimes really bad, but sometimes really funny. It seems George Lucas and this second writer (Jonathan Hales) had no idea what the hell they're doing, and it shows... it seriously shows... 

There's barely anything I actually like in this movie. Ewan McGregor still does a good job as Obi-Wan and John Williams' score is alright, but it certainly is my least favorite Star Wars soundtrack. 

One scene I like in concept and almost in execution was whenever Anakin finds his dying mother. She ends up saying ""I love you"" and dies in his arms, pretty cliche but it was pretty sad as well. Sadly, it's followed up by two really terrible scenes (one of them very funny). 

The first scene is immediately after Anakin's mom dies, he slaughters all the Tuskin Raiders. Why? It's pretty clear Lucas is trying to show the audience that Anakin is moving towards the dark side with all these terrible things happening to him, but why does he have to kill the sand people? It would of been so much better if he had just snuck out of the camp with his mother's body and went back to Padme and his family members without killing anyone. Have him swallow the sadness like Luke did in the '77 Star Wars. 

The second scene is when Anakin returns to Padme and has an outburst of how he killed all the sand people and how much he hates them, complete with him tearing up about it. It's so damn funny, but I feel really bad for Hayden Christensen (actor who plays Anakin). I get the impression that he's really trying to give a good performance, but Lucas' script is so terrible that it becomes so hilariously bad. 

The digital effects are both pretty good and very bad, mostly suffering by the fact that instead of 20% practical effects it's now around 5%-10% practical, just about everything in this movie is a digital effect. A lot of it looks really bad, especially the greenscreen bits. 

""Attack of the Clones"" is so much worse than ""Phantom Menace"", it wasn't as horrendous to sit through like I thought it would be, but I still think it is definitely the worst Star Wars movie we ever got. I am never going back to watch this movie unless I'm in the mood for watching a movie that's ""So bad it's funny"". 

I'm gonna try to make it my goal to see every Star Wars movie in a movie theater, but when I end up only having ""Attack of the Clones"" as the final movie to see, I hope it's with my friends so that we could have a ""MST3K/RiffTrax"" sort of commentary. That's how hilariously bad this movie is, I'll never be able to take it seriously. 

I didn't even touch on how they gave Yoda a stupid baby sized lightsaber and how that goes against everything he stood for in the Original Trilogy..."
"Jun 23, 2013",1,"Star Wars Episode II Attack of The Clones is the worst Star Wars movie ever. It has a lame script, terrible action sequences, a horrible romance, clunky dialogue, and overall poor filmmaking. Now I don't need to kick a dead wamp rat, hell RedLetterMedia has said most of what I want to say, so I'm just going to try to make this as short as I can.   The story here is that Anakin must protect fine ass Natalie Portman from assassination by bounty hunters hired by a Sepratist faction led by the sinister Count Dooku (Christopher Lee, whose incredible talents are just wasted here), while Obi-Wan(Ewan McGregor, whose talents are also wasted here) hunts down the bounty hunters: Completely fucking retarded. The plot has so many plot holes, and the fact that the main characters are all morons doesn't help.

  All the main characters in this movie are stupid idiots. For example, in the beginning of the movie Natalie Portman barely survives an explosion on a landing pad; now you'd think that she want to be somewhere safe mere hours after that occurred. But nope, instead, while she knows that someone is trying to kill her she sleeps in a bedroom with a massive window where a city of billions can see her, and to top it off she turns off all the security cameras so that she could have her privacy. Do I smell bullshit?  If it had been the Slender Man that was after her, she would've gotten killed. Did she think of that? Or what if the assassin was not a complete buffoon and just parked his/her speeder across the street and sniped her from the window. 

  Now to talk about the worst part of Attack of the Clones: the romance. The romance in this movie is so flat, dull, boring, uninspired, and cliché' romance I have seen since Daredevil. And the dialogue Anakin and Natalie Portman say to each other is so cringe worthy, it's the type of dialogue where you say ""You can't be fucking serious"" like twenty times. To anybody who likes this piece of shit: Tell me with a straight face that ""I don't like sand"" And ""I wish I could just wish away my feelings"" is good dialogue. You can't and you know it. I wouldn't mind so much if it were only a small part in the movie, but the romance part is like 60% of Attack of the Clones, which you can tell is a big problem. You don't care about the romance, because the two characters have no chemistry, no real reason to love each other other than the fact that they want to fuck each other in the grass. Cut me a break.

  The characters are unlikable hypocrites that you hope die in the most awful way possible. For example, whenever Anakin does something reckless he tells him ""Oh Anakin you are reckless"" and when a probe droid outside the window is about to assassinate Natalie Portman, Obi-Wan jumps out the window at it. Okay, so rescuing your master is reckless but fucking jumping out the window isn't? Anakin, who is a jedi knight which means he is supposed to love democracy and prefer freedom to dictatorship if I understood correctly, says he supports a fascist dictatorship, and Natalie Portman still falls in love with him. And even after he murders a whole village of sand people, women and children included, and admits to Portman what he did she still falls for him. What kind of sick bitch is she? Anakin Skywalker has to be the most unlikable protagonist I have seen... ever!

  The action scenes, while well shot and well directed, are also a letdown. Because we don't care about the characters or story, all the tension is immediately pulled away and they become boring. We don't care if the jedi stop Dooku from escaping, cause we don't even know what his intentions are, so what's the danger in him escaping? I say let him. And during the final duel (Which rips off Empire Strikes Back so much that it honestly becomes embarrassing) we don't care if Anakin dies, hell in fact I wanted him to die. You can't just shove in action scenes to try to make up for poor storytelling (cough*Michael Bay*cough). The special effects don't fare any better, they still look fake as hell to me and I could tell that it is all shot against a blue screen.

  Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace is a horrible movie, the fact that anybody likes that movie astounds me. However, The Phantom Menace is a masterpiece compared to the Clusterfuck that is Attack of the Clones. I know that if any Star Wars fanboys read this, they're going to tear me a new one. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to just lay down and praise the first two Star Wars prequels when I think that they are shit. This was the point when the Star Wars franchise seemed dead; however we all received a pleasant surprise with Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith."
"Jun 23, 2013",3.5,"A slight improvement on Episode I, it's a fun film. ."
"Jun 22, 2013",4,"Out of the new trilogy this one is my least favorite. It's simply the filler story. It's a great and fun movie with lots of amazing visuals, but the story writing falls short in comparison with the other five. I still like it but won't watch it as much as the other films. Not to mention it spawned the awful ""Clone Wars"" 3-D animated movie/cartoon series."
"Jun 22, 2013",4,A highly underrated entry into the Star Wars saga.  A good story with decent acting and amazing effects.

"Jun 18, 2013",2,"Attack of the Clones, like Phantom, suffers from bad writing and awkward acting. The film improves in its final 15 minutes, however, with engaging action sequences."
"Jun 18, 2013",3.5,"George Lucas doesn't fail in this entry of the Star Wars series. I feel Lucas' idea of showcasing the beginning of Anakin Skywalker transforming to Darth Vader is very interesting and underrated. Although, pressing the love story of PadmÃ (C) Amidala (Natalie Portman) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) comes off as boring and the chemistry and dialogue between the two is just bad. Also, Christopher Lee plays a worthy villain in Count Dooku.   Ultimately, the story is well-crafted in a sense of what its leading up to and the way special effects carry the action packed battle scenes are enough to entertain and cover its flaws."
"Jun 16, 2013",4,Most of these stars come from the moment when Yoda pulls out a lightsaber for the first time.

"Jun 14, 2013",4.5,A great tragic love story

"Jun 13, 2013",1.5,Suffers from similar problems as Phantom Menace but also has one of the most wooden and unconvincing romances ever seen on screen.
"Jun 13, 2013",3.5,star wars episode 2 in my mind is weaker than the phantom menace but it is still a good sci fi flick for nerds to enjoy

"Jun 10, 2013",3,"61%
It may be technically prettier than Phantom Menace and have no stupid kid lead, but still suffers from shitty dialogue and an equally convoluted plot."
"Jun 09, 2013",3.5,"An improvement in that it's not kiddiefied.  You can tell that Lucas is loosening up a little more.  The inherent flaws from episode 1 are still present here the stiff acting, clunky exposition filled dialogue, and an overall artificiality of the film.  The love story also comes off as forced or awkward.  Overall though the clone war is amazing, the visual fx even better,  and its Star Wars!  It just works inspite of the shortcomings."
"Jun 09, 2013",3,"Well, it's another OK movie, a bit better than Pahntom...in a technical way. I found this Anakin very unlikeable and the movie feels overlong at times. The climax is epic, but the outcome is mixed."
"Jun 08, 2013",2.5,"While it proves to outdo the first prequel, which wasn't very hard to do anyway, this movie is still nothing short of a mediocre film at best."
"Jun 07, 2013",1,Boring. The movie where I gave up on George Lucas.
"Jun 05, 2013",1.5,Attack of the clone is probably the worst prequel besides the Geanosha battle and Christopher lee I'd give it a 1 star or lower the acting is wooden and dull and Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen have HORRIBLE chemistry again Ewan McGregor is great in his role
"Jun 03, 2013",2.5,"The least of the very shallow prequels. The romance is dull and frustrating, the acting is wooden and at times even awkward (the romance makes it worse) and the dialogue is really bad in some spots (the acting AND romance make it worse). However, the well choreographed fight scenes make the movie fun to watch in some spots."
"Jun 02, 2013",1.5,As a kid i watched all the starwars movies but then you grow up to see how much crap children actually like and how stupid these films are....boring
"Jun 01, 2013",2,An extra star for not being episode I.
"Jun 01, 2013",2.5,an okay movie overall but still has laughable dialogue and bad acting.
"Jun 01, 2013",5,Great battle royale. Better than last Jedi for sure!!
"May 31, 2013",2,Did not have the same feel and look of the originals..too much computer animation..too many popular actors.
"May 28, 2013",2,"The special effects are undeniably impressive, yet somewhat tiresome and the diabolical screenplay robs the material of some of its mythology. In spite of this; Count Dooku is a welcome addition to the Star Wars universe."
"May 27, 2013",4.5,My favorite Star Wars movie if the prequel set.
"May 27, 2013",3,Its alright but you have to watch if you wanna follow the story.
"May 27, 2013",0.5,"Even as a kid and now, this was as boring as fuck"
"May 26, 2013",2,The story is awkward at best and doesn't flow. It is so full of conflict that it is not enjoyable to watch. In my opinion this film ruined Lucas's reputation for the Star Wars franchise.
"May 25, 2013",5,as always like every other Star Wars film very worthwhile and great to watch and see a no on DVD
"May 25, 2013",3,"Is it me, or is this next triology of Star Wars films lacking some ingredient of a perfect formula. Is it because i am old now, and less impressionable. I want these films to be so good, but watching this just makes me want to pick holes in it, to pieces. 1st of all, i find Annakin so pathetic and annoying. What did he do to woo Senator Amidala exactly. I didnt notice him have any charm whatsoever, and just mainly behaved like a spoilt child. And then while she sleeps in her room in Courascant, state of the art bugs nearly kill her while she chooses an old beat up R2D2 to stand watch in her room. Surely she can afford some more modern security. And then watching the same R2D2 painfully negotiate the stairs in Naboo, whilst still managing to keep up with the 2 young lovers. And then whats all this 'death stcks' rubbish, about 'going off to rethink your life'. Is old Lucas throwing a bit of education in his movie that reflects current attitudes. That can only make the movie appear dated eventually. The acting is still wooden. The script lacks fun, and the characters all lack fun too. But saying all that, i did enjoy watching the movie. The effects were great and i am still a Star Wars fan"
"May 24, 2013",3,"It is a slight improvement over The Phantom Menice, but it is still very flawed. It is worthy of its title and it has a lot of action. It has too much cheesy acting by Hayden Christianson but he gets much better in Episode III if I remember correctly!"
"May 22, 2013",2.5,Some what of an improvement over the first prequel... My biggest issue was that horrible performance from Hayden Christensen.
"May 21, 2013",4,"""Master Kenobi, you disappoint me! Yoda holds you in such high esteem...surely you could do better!""

After the mixed reaction of The Phantom Menace (which despite its flaws, was still an entertaining prequel), there were fears that the rest of the prequel trilogy would be as lackluster. And now we arrive at Episode II. While there were things that were considered an improvement over Phantom by the majority, it was still considered really disappointing by a lot of people, particularly those that are super huge fans of the original trilogy. And as with my thoughts on Phantom, I was too forgiving of Attack of the Clones as well; there's still some flaws scattered throughout the film, but I was more visually entertained this time around and in the end, for me, it was a slight improvement over The Phantom Menace.

10 years after the Naboo invasion in Phantom Menace, Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is a Jedi apprentice to Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). We then find out that the Republic is in a bit of a political crisis, debating on whether Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) should build a grand army to stop a separatist movement led by former Jedi Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), a movement that's really hurting the intention of the Jedi in the first place. When Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) avoids two assassination attempts on her life, Anakin is sent to transport the former Queen to her home in Naboo for protection while Obi-Wan tracks down the assassin who tried to kill her. What follows is a forbidden romance between Anakin and Padme, and the beginning of the Clone Wars.

The film also stars Frank Oz as Yoda, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, and Temuera Morrison as the bounty hunter Jango Fett.

Let me get the bad stuff out of the way, cause quite a bit of things to criticize in this movie. First off, Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin Skywalker is terrible. Absolutely terrible. While I can see the characters' hints at becoming Darth Vader, Christensen makes the acting feel heavily forced. He also doesn't create sympathy for his character when he messes up. Instead, his acting treats the character like an obnoxious, whiny, total jerk that makes us wonder why Anakin became a Jedi in the first place. There were moments in the film that should have been strong in emotions in the Anakin character, such as his actions after the loss of his mother, but Christensen's ""whininess"" is extremely bland that I just couldn't buy it. Now I can see why people hated Mark Hamill's performance as Luke for being ""whiny"", which I didn't cause I thought Hamill was great in the role. I guess it runs in the Skywalker family. the bad thing about this is that Jake Lloyd was much better at Anakin that what Christensen does in this film, though he does do a better job in the next film.

The other thing I hate about this film, and this has been attacked by a lot of people, from Star Wars fans to just average filmgoers, is the romance between Anakin and Padme. While we needed to see the characters develop a forbidden romance, as it leads in with the original trilogy with Luke and Leia, but it's just so... boring. While I liked Natalie Portman in the role (she had improved acting and got rid of that cringe-inducing accent in Phantom), Christensen's acting and the chemistry is just extremely awkward and forced. Plus there's some really bad, cringe-inducing dialogue in these scenes, which really surprises me in a Star Wars film. If this wasn't a Star Wars film, I thought I was watching a really bad romantic comedy. Take a read at some of this atrocious dialogue:

""Please don't look at me like that.""
""Why not?""
""Because it makes me look uncomfortable.""

And here's another one:
""I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.""
""What are you talking about?""
""I love you.""
""You love me? I thought that we had decided not to fall in love--that we would be forced to live a lie and that it would destroy our lives.""
""I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. I  truly, deeply love you, and before we die I want you to know.""

But that's not the absolute worst thing either character says. This is:
""I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything is soft and smooth.""

George Lucas has admitted that he's not a good screenwriter after the many criticisms of the dialogue. And because of that, I forgive him for that. Cause the good news he, he's a pretty good director, and for the most part, Attack of the Clones is a good film. The visuals, which are mostly digital, are absolutely beautiful and there are some awesome action sequences, such as a chase scene in Coreausant, Obi-Wan's fight with Jango Fett, a battle inside a Roman-styled coliseum, and Yoda's lightsaber duel with Count Dooku (yes, I said Yoda fights in this one; it's pretty awesome). There's parts of the story that were really strong in the suspense department, such as Obi-Wan's tracking on the bounty hunter. The political moments were more captivating than Phantom was and the best part, Jar Jar's role is reduced to just three scenes, and there's no childish, juvenile humor in his smaller role.

Aside from Christensen's terribly awful performance, the rest was pretty good. Natalie Portman has improved as Padme as she's gotten rid of that atrocious accent in Phantom. Her chemistry with Christensen in the romantic scenes are indeed weak, but I liked her for eye candy. Ewan McGregor has also improved as Obi-Wan; more confident and more in style of what Alec Guinness was doing in the original films. Samuel L. Jackson has also improved as Mace Windu. He now acts more like a Jedi and less Samuel L. Jackson. Purple lightsaber. Extremely original. Ian McDiarmid??? Great as always. And Christopher Lee does a good job as Count Dooku, with that sinisterness of what Lee usually does. I also liked the appearances of 3PO and R2. Their humor throughout definitely makes up for the juvenile, poop humor scattered in Phantom.

John Williams does another score for this film, and while it's not his greatest score in the franchise (I would say it's his weakest), it's still a good listen to, the best of which is the love theme, ""Across the Stars"", a beautiful, sweeping love theme that makes up for the awkward, bland romance in this film.

While the romance is forced and Hayden Christensen does a poor job as Anakin, Attack of the Clones is a better film than Phantom Menace, though a slight improvement. There's still some things that could have been better, but George Lucas does a better job at getting the audience into the Star Wars galaxy more than Phantom did.

""Victory? Victory you say? Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War has."
"May 20, 2013",5,Stunning visual effects. True Star Wars fashion.
"May 20, 2013",3,its an improvement from episode one but it still has stale dialogue.
"May 19, 2013",2,A Complete misfire the only redeemable quality's being a few fight scenes and great visuals but is completely bogged down by the terrible Dialogue and thin plot
"May 17, 2013",5,Good sequel to phantom menace awesome action scenes great story five stars
"May 17, 2013",5,"good movie, drags in spots and could use tighter editing and better dialogue, but better than most summer movies"
"May 17, 2013",3,"Possibly my least favorite of the franchise on the acting and directorial front, I can't deny that in terms of narrative strength and just pure focus this is a significantly better movie than The Phantom Menace. I just wish we didn't spend so much time on the most awkward and unconvincing on-screen relationship I've ever seen: Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman. Portman is trying her hardest to convince you and I know that Hayden is too, but not once did I feel that they actually loved one another. It just feels like another stepping stone toward the eventual end that everyone wants to see more than this: the final transformation into Darth Vader."
"May 16, 2013",3.5,"Loved this movie.  Jango Fett, Clones, grown up Anakin, Droids.  Kid me couldn't help but to watch this movie.  Worthy of watching for sure.  Exciting action throughout."
"May 16, 2013",4,"Again, another great star wars movie."
"May 16, 2013",4,"The saga continues with this sequel prequel that continues forward for its destination to finally seeing Skywalker becoming Darth Vader. So how was it?
I'll be fair. When I first saw this film I didn't really enjoy it. I was pretty bored. But the more I see it and pay attention, it's actually not that bad at all. 
The story is a little eh and the chemistry between Anakan and padme doesn't feel right and more awkward but it's way more enjoyable then Episode I. This one has a lot more cgi tho and I didn't really enjoy that. Prefer practical effects and props.
Everyone plays there roles fine, the action pieces are pretty cool, especially the fight between Obi Won Kenobi and Jango Fett, father of future Boba Fett. Spoiler alert haha. Decent movie in the end, had fun with it. Like it way more than Episode I. Only one more episode to go and the saga is complete."
"May 15, 2013",3.5,Okay. Lucas could have done better.
"May 15, 2013",0.5,"The worst thing ever made by humans, i cant't begin to articulate how bad this movie is. If you loved the original trilogy, watching this movie will make you angry"
"May 12, 2013",5,"If you like Star Wars, you'll love this action packed movie! George Lucas did it again!"
"May 11, 2013",5,yaaaaa....i love star wars
"May 11, 2013",3,"I had not watched this in years, but Maddie's love of the worms and severed limbs drew me back to another viewing. The odes to the OT is what gets you through the moments that are barely watchable."
"May 11, 2013",2.5,Mediocre yet worthy of its title.
"May 11, 2013",4,Better than Episode 1.  But not much.
"May 10, 2013",2.5,"You would think that good old Uncle George would have learned from the mistakes he made with Episode 1....erm, not quite. So, this is the one where we see an older Anakin. Learning the ways of the force. I was intriqued how this might turn out. Also, I was interested in seeing how the relationship between him and Padme would blossom into a love story. We got to see both. But we were once again frustrated with how it all played out. Hayden Christiansen's Anakin is a whinning, ill tempered bitch. He gives everyone a hard time. I know he is meant to be a bit hot headed, and stubborn. But the way he was portrayed made me want to hate the guy! And don't get me started about the love affair forming between Anakin and Padme. I was totally unconvincing, and made me uncomfortable. The scene where He declares his love to her is filled with some of the most cringey embaressing dialogue I have ever heard. Even Natalie Portman looks truly embarressed  in this scene as Hayden Christensen spouts totally awful love sick dialogue to her.I couldn't care less for either of them. Otherwise, we get a slightly interesting plotline involving Obi Wan's (Ewan McGregor)investigation of the creation of a clone army. Like Episode 1, there are some thrilling set pieces. Obi Wan's pursuit of Bounty hunter Jango Fett through an asteroid field. And the Jedi knights descending upon the arena to rescue the captured Obi Wan, Anakin, And Padme. The final battle between the Jedi, Yoda, and Count Dooku didn't disappoint either. It was fantastic, and quite a relief to see that they managed to make Yoda in action actually look cool, and not silly However, once again the movie suffers from Lucas' total over reliance of entire scenes rendered in CGI. And his aparent lack of writing half decent dialogue, and not great directing still stands out. Must try harder next time Uncle George."
"May 10, 2013",2,way better then episode 1 but that doesnt say alot....
"May 09, 2013",3,Kxxjxjxjxjxjxjxkxkckxj
"May 09, 2013",1,"This movie is one of the poorest examples of storytelling, pacing, and character development I've ever seen."
"May 09, 2013",1,I saw it in a theatre and found it largely a waste of time considering how long it was between the original trilogy and the two prequels.
"May 08, 2013",2.5,Bad acting continues...way too long of a movie
"May 07, 2013",4,A lot better than I remember it being. Looked fab on my home cinema screen. Tons of action but also lots of story and political intrigue in this sophisticated addition to the saga.
"May 06, 2013",2.5,This was better than episode one but still not a good star wars movie.The script is still rubbish.Some of the acting is not that good.That stupid retarded love story is cheesy and pointless.Some of the effects and action scenes are impressive but that does not make for a cheesy star wars movie.
"May 06, 2013",3,"Attack of the Clones is good, but still doesn't feel like classic Star Wars. It's still cool to see all the things that happened in the past."
"May 05, 2013",4,I think this will redeem the franchise after the sorta fail of episode 1 3d but at least it's a lot more awesome I give this 4.9 out of 5 gold bricks
"May 05, 2013",3,"Definately not the most thrilling Star Wars film - probably my least favourite. Has some good elements but the 'love scene', that's so widely known, is beyond poor - boring compared to the others."
"May 02, 2013",2.5,"A good movie But my Least favourite Star Wars film, most of it was boring"
"May 01, 2013",3,Hayden Christensen was the worse decision ever but I liked it a lot better than Episode I
"May 01, 2013",3,Yoda and Mace Windu make this movie worth viewing...solely.
"Apr 27, 2013",3.5,loved it as a kid and its still ok 6/10
"Apr 27, 2013",2,This is probably the worse one of the three
"Apr 26, 2013",1,And the torture continues.
"Apr 25, 2013",5,some of the best sifi movies ever made.
"Apr 25, 2013",4,"Continuing my marathon of all the Star Wars films, in preparation for The Force Awakens, I followed up The Phantom Menace with Attack of the Clones. Just like Episode I, this film receives a lot of hate from Star Wars fans and while there are definitely flaws, just like the previous film, I think Episode II does remedy some of the problems from the first film.

For example, there are less scenes of Jar Jar Binks this time around and even in the scenes he is in, there is no needless, unfunny comic relief present from his character. Also, Jake Lloyd is not present now that Anakin has grown older in this film's timeline.

However, some of the problems in The Phantom Menace do continue over into Attack of the Clones. For one thing, the film could have benefited from more use of practical effects. The dialogue isn't always the best amongst other problems.

With that said, just like Episode I, I do believe there are many redeeming qualities to be found in Episode II. Firstly, I just love the worlds that George Lucas created with this film, especially the scenes on Coruscant at the beginning, the cloning unit on Kamino and Geonosis near the end. This is the one thing that Lucas nailed in this film is allowing you to breathe and immerse yourself in these creative worlds. The action sequences are once again exciting, particularly the climactic battle on Geonosis. The two chase sequences were also exciting, when Obi-Wan was following Zam and chasing down Jango Fett through the Asteroid field. The John Williams score once again stands out. Ewan McGregor owns it as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Christopher Lee is awesome as Count Dooku and I actually sympathised with Anakin's character, because I felt his pain when (SPOILER) his mother dies and when he broke down and confessed to Padme what he had done to the Tusken Raiders as a result.

So overall, even though Attack of the Clones definitely has flaws, it is an improvement over The Phantom Menace and while objectively my rating would be lower, I'm going to stick with me 4 star rating as I did still really enjoy revisiting this film for the reasons I stated."
"Apr 25, 2013",3.5,"""Attack Of The Clones"" has a faster pace and better energetic action sequences than ""The Phantom Menace"", but it still suffers from uneven acting and underdeveloped characters."
"Apr 25, 2013",5,A great movie just as good as the first
"Apr 23, 2013",0.5,"Well, The Phantom Menace was awful. Maybe this one will be better! It isn't. It is terribly scripted, terribly acted, terribly directed, and so one. This movie is movie is animated. With bits of live action, but still animated. The CGI effects are awful. This movie isn't any better than the first prequel. And the love story! The love story in this movie is cringe-inducing! The two characters have nothing in common and can only talk about how 'in love' they are. It. Is. Awful."
"Apr 23, 2013",2,"In my opinion, the second worst movie in the star wars saga, it's bland, doesn't capture the right enviroment for a star wars movie, the movie doesn't make me care about the love scenes, as in matter of fact, the movie feels like it's trying to shove their love relationship down your throat. The new characters that are introduced(count dooku and jango fett) are bland and don't deserve they praise they get. A bad movie, only a couple of good action scenes, but overall pretty forgettable  and boring."
"Apr 23, 2013",2,Its better than episode 1... that's something.
"Apr 22, 2013",5,star wars fan from the beginning. love this movie.
"Apr 22, 2013",3,"The worst Star Wars movie. The god-awful ""love"" between Anakin amd Padme killed it."
"Apr 22, 2013",5,This one is my fav. of the series of Star Wars movies!
"Apr 21, 2013",4,best part of this movie is when Yoda came out of the hall with his lightsaber like he had the only lighter in a crackhouse

It's more boring then the first
Crappy acting :(

A good ending"
"Apr 20, 2013",4,"Looking fwd to the 3D version! I really enjoyed this amazing sequal; here u can really c how Lucas envisioned Star Wars. Other than a couple of cheesy lines in the romantic parts, i consider this as my 2nd fav movie in the series (part 5 is my first)"
"Apr 20, 2013",0.5,"Oh, yeah. Let me go pay $15 of my hard earned money to go see not only one of the worst Star Wars, but one of the worst movies ever made.
I would pay double the IMAX 3D luxury theater ticket price to not have seen this when I picked it up in the $5 bin at Walmart."
"Apr 19, 2013",2.5,This movie made me hate Hayden Christensen more than anything else.
"Apr 17, 2013",5,"seen this movie already, not sure why it's coming back in the movies. anyhow it was a good one."
"Apr 16, 2013",3,"Jar Binks is annoying, and the acting is wooden like a log."
"Apr 15, 2013",3.5,"This is not the best Star Wars film either, but it is still fun and good to see. It has some boring scenes, but it has many good ones in the end! The acting by MOST actors in okay i guess. The story is a bit of, but it is still funny. 
This is a good and fun film, accept it!"
"Apr 15, 2013",2,Maybe my least favorite Star Wars movie to date.
"Apr 13, 2013",3,"Star Wars is awesome, but the ""first 3"" are lame this is a good movie nevertheless."
"Apr 12, 2013",0.5,"While many were overwhelmed by just how bad the Phantom Menace was, there was still hope that Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones would be a little better, however, none of us could imagine that Lucas would take all the problems from Episode 1 and multiply it so dramatically that the Holiday Special looked more interesting than this abomination.  The second time around the story got much more complex, uninteresting, and a whole lot more idiotic.  The characters just aren't more uninteresting this time around they're all complete morons; a 5 year old that has never seen the original trilogy could of told you that Palpatine was behind it all how in the world could this supposedly genius Jedi Council or the apparent very smart  Padme not connect at least one dot.  Lucas obviously had no idea what he was doing; borrowing so much from the original trilogy and ripping off countless other films it's sort of sad to remember this is the man that created Star Wars.  However, Lucas must have realized half way into writing that this would be a repeat of the last film so incomes a overdose of special effects; sure they look interesting at first but thirty minutes in they get old and don't add anything to the movie beside allowing Lucas to advertise the new toy lines for kids and parents.  To simplify this Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones is not only the worst Star Wars film of all time, but it's also one of the worst Sci-Fi and one of the Worst films of all time.Under any circumstances don't watch this mess.  It's not a so bad its good film or anything of that nature it's simply an awful film from beginning to end avoid at all costs."
"Apr 11, 2013",3,Wha! ONE lightsabre battle?? what a let down (least it had yoda doin the sabreing)
"Apr 11, 2013",2.5,"Sooooo much better than Episode I.  But that's not exactly a compliment.  So I'll try again; Clones is beautiful, and the love story is cute.  It's a shame that Lucas didn't spend any of his time or money on making sure his actors were able to act, instead of just doing dry readings of the script.  I blame you Lucas; all the toys in the world don't make a good movie.  Actors you give a crap about make a good movie."
"Apr 09, 2013",2,Its saved by the epic fight sequence towards the end of the film.
"Apr 07, 2013",2,"This is a pretty bad movie. Attack of the Clones is by far the worst Star Wars Episode. Awful CGI effects, really boring scenes, and terrible dialogue make it embarrassing to even call this a Star Wars movie."
"Apr 07, 2013",3,ANAKIN IS NOT AS BAD AN ACTOR AS YOU GUYS SAY HE IS.
"Apr 06, 2013",2.5,worst star wars movie ever.....Though it was cool to see Yoda fight for the 1st time.
"Apr 06, 2013",3,"Inconsistent storytelling and Hayden Christensen's poor performance make Attack of the Clones the worst of the Star Wars movies, but there is plenty of visual dazzle, some great action scenes, and the final act is considerably better than the rest of the film."
"Apr 06, 2013",4,"Having suffered an enormous, ridiculously exaggerated backlash over the prominence of Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) in 'The Phantom Menace' (1999), George Lucas pulls back the long-eared klutz to a much smaller role here. (It was the writer/director's original intention to have him be the centre of the prequel trilogy). 

This leaves more time for favourites C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) to reclaim their spot as the accidental witnesses/contributing figures to the unfolding action (although C-3PO is uncharacteristically given some one-liners here). 

The developing relationship between Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) is nicely done, Yoda (Frank Oz) steals the show, particularly with his lightsaber battle against Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), and there's an exciting gladiatorial battle involving our favourite characters and two sets of Clone armies. 

An overall entertaining adventure. 

(It was followed by the critically panned, moderately successful 'The Clone Wars' (2008), which launching the animated television series of the same name.)"
"Apr 05, 2013",3,Better than the phantom menace!
"Apr 05, 2013",1.5,It's bad. Really bad. Not even McGregor or Portman could fix the god-awful script.
"Apr 04, 2013",5,very Mr lugus does it again
"Apr 04, 2013",2.5,"I wasn't a big fan of Hayden Christensen and actually found his acting performance a bit distracting.  I understand that he was suppose to portray a conflicted Anakin Skywalker, but I found the whole performance a bit whinny - it eventually grated on my nerves.  If anything the movie feels like a necessary evil, a movie that needed to made in order to bridge the gap between Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith.  Or to but it more bluntly the movie felt like it was a money grab that was going through the motions.  This could have been a whole lot better."
"Apr 03, 2013",0.5,"I dont even consider this a StarWars movie. I wish this never existed. Obi Wan looked like a math teacher with a mullet, and for some reason Lucas killed off Darth Maul only to replace him with darkside Bob Barker. Hayden Christenson donned the name Mannequin Skywalker for more wooden than Keannu Reeves."
"Apr 02, 2013",3,"I came into this viewing of the Star Wars saga thinking that Ep. 1 was awful, 2 was so-so, and 3 was great except for dialog and stuff. I came out with different opinions. Star Wars Episode II wants to be a love story, a detective story, an action movie, and the beginning of a tragedy.

* The love story is one of those that started out OK, but after repeated viewings, all I am is tired of Anakin's whining.
* The detective story fails. We know there is a mystery, but we're never sure what it is, and whatever it is, we know it never gets solved, not even in Ep. 3.
* The action film is excellent. It was a lot of fun to see the clones for the first time, and still is. It's also a lot of fun to see more than two Jedi with lightsabers drawn in the same room.
* As the beginning of a tragedy, my reaction is mixed. I still love Ian McDarmid's performance as the manipulative Chancellor Palpatine, and it is highlight of this film. Anakin, on the other hand, more often comes across as a whiny teenager than someone who actually has something important to say. Still, one of the most poignant moments in the film is the one where he realizes the enormity of what he has done in slaying the sand people.

Overall, Star Wars Episode II is an OK movie, but it benefits more from its position in the saga than on its own merits."
"Apr 01, 2013",1.5,"Worst of the entire series, this film just wasn't even enough for a mindless kid movie. I don't despise it, but I do not like it either. At all"
"Apr 01, 2013",2.5,"The equally as horrible sequels arrives years later.

Lucas makes another Star Wars movie, and it's no improvement. Attack of the Clones has even more action and visual effects making it more of a Michael Bay movie. The plot is a bit more interesting than the Phantom Menace, but the diologue is no better and the acting is nothing special besides Ewan McGregor, Sam Jackson's and yes I'm saying it, Yoda.

This is as equally bad I'm giving it 5 out of 10"
"Mar 31, 2013",1,Most potential but most disappointing acting and story-telling in the entire Star Wars franchise.

"Mar 29, 2013",3.5,"The love story between Anakin and Padme thoroughly pisses me off every time I see it, so it's my least favorite star wars flick. Still a pretty great movie though"
"Mar 28, 2013",0.5,"Definitely not the best movie of the saga. In fact it might be the worst. Ewan McGregor is not the one I'm having problems with. The thing that DOES frustrate me though is Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman, they're both quite good actors, but not in this movie. Another thing that is unrealistic is the fact that it goes from peaceful Naboo to full scale war Geonosis. Overall it is not a good movie."
"Mar 28, 2013",0.5,"Terribly acted, terribly directed, terribly written, terribly animated and just plain terrible, 'Attack of the Clones' is, for my money, the worst Star Wars film yet made. Which isn't to say the other prequel films are that much better; certainly a solid case could be made for any of the three being the worst."
"Mar 27, 2013",4,Everybody needs to shut up about the prequals vecause if tje sycked so bad why is it that they mad for than 2 billon dollars combined. This movie added that yoda was more than just wise that he was a light saber master as well and how the death star was even designed. This movie will look great and 3d cant what to see yoda jump and twist in front of the croud
"Mar 27, 2013",4.5,Could've been better.  Loved the clone battle
"Mar 27, 2013",2,Worst of the Star Wars flicks...even PM had redeeming qualities.  Only Yoda shines.
"Mar 25, 2013",3,Anakin u suck!!!!!!!
"Mar 25, 2013",3,it was ok but nothing special have never been very keen on this one too many effects not enough acting
"Mar 25, 2013",3,"I like Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, but this film leaves a bad taste."
"Mar 25, 2013",2.5,"Anakin's dialogue. Why, George, why?"
"Mar 25, 2013",3,"Terrible acting and a terrible love story, but some pretty awesome action, at very least."
"Mar 24, 2013",3,"To me, it's the least bad of the prequels. The dialouge between the romantic leads and the acting (Hayden Christensen) is enjoyably bad. The arena battle is entertaining, so basically a guilty pleasure."
"Mar 24, 2013",3,Do I really need to say anything?
"Mar 24, 2013",4,A must see episode of the saga!
"Mar 24, 2013",5,Who doesn't love StarWars?
"Mar 23, 2013",3,"It's my least favorite of the saga, but it's not as terrible as I remember it being."
"Mar 22, 2013",3.5,"Then suddenly it's an awkward love story. Nevertheless, the sword-fighting scenes are fun to watch."
"Mar 22, 2013",5,Star Wars...one word...EPIC
"Mar 22, 2013",3,"A big visual improvement over the Phantom Menace, but all the storytelling problems remain."
"Mar 22, 2013",3,The prequel series was much maligned but it wasn't all bad. There are several scenes that inspire head scratching but there are goodies to be found in the lead up to the tremendous Episode III.
"Mar 22, 2013",3,"slightly better than the Phantom Menace, but still compairs weak to the classic Star Wars and TESB...."
"Mar 21, 2013",3.5,Not one of my favorites. Maybe I will see it in 3D.
"Mar 21, 2013",4,Star Wars are okay movies....
"Mar 20, 2013",5,hey flickster...get Ur f.ING shit together ...Ur program has been f.ed up for a week now...!!!!!!!!
"Mar 20, 2013",2.5,wasn't my favorite SW but good.
"Mar 20, 2013",1,The worst of the prequels thanks to Christensen's acting.
"Mar 20, 2013",2.5,"Can't help feeling cheated by this installment of the Star Wars prequels. While Phantom Menace got ridiculed on the burden of years of expectation, Clones actually went backwards in many ways. The over playing and bad acting of the love story gets tired long before it finishes and other elements suffer in its wake. Action scenes and sound effects as always from Lucas are excellent, but this is everything Empire Strikes Back was not... average! At least we see a lot less of a certain JJ Binks this time around!"
"Mar 19, 2013",4,"This was a great movie, but some of the performances held back the movie. The action is crazy and it was awesome to see Yoda fight."
"Mar 18, 2013",4,I enjoyed it about as much as The Phantom Menace.
"Mar 18, 2013",0.5,Don't watch this. Don't ruin what Star Wars is.
"Mar 18, 2013",2.5,"Better than the first, but still cartoony and horribly written. What was with that sub plot between Anakin and Padme? You call that a relationship?"
"Mar 17, 2013",4,"Much better than episode 1.   However, the firs three were by far the best..."
"Mar 17, 2013",4.5,It is very exciting and very well put
"Mar 17, 2013",3,"Attack of the Clones improves on its predecessor with better action and more relevant storytelling, but unfortunately remains dull at times with horrendous dialogue and acting between Anakin and Padme."
"Mar 17, 2013",2.5,The machinations that lead to the grand clone army of the Empire and seeing Yoda fight are the highlights of a film that may well entertain while watching it but unfortunately produces limited memories amongst the stiff dialogue and technological wizardry.
"Mar 12, 2013",4,"The movie suffers from the love story, but the action and the rest of the story is great!"
"Mar 11, 2013",3,"Somewhat better than the childish first of the ""new trilogy"" but still should've never been made."
"Mar 09, 2013",2,"A minor improvement, Attack of the Clones has a 40 minutes of excellent action sequence but the rest of it is about as interesting as a tuna sandwich."
"Mar 07, 2013",2.5,"Slight improvement over the previous installment. Lucas' directing seems to be under control, as the story is more focused. Sadly, the movie suffers from an over abundance of green screen and a romantic subplot that just doesn't work. Lucas wrote horrible dialogue that meshed with cheesy moments that just make you want to cover your eyes. When Christenson and Portman are on screen you just want it to stop. Your acting in a movie is decided by the director. You could be an amazing actor, but if the director cant direct his cast, then the acting will be crap. That seems to be the case here especially in the case of the romantic subplot. Other than this, the movie works. The plot is pretty solid, the characters are more interesting and more developed, and it's well written. But the flaws are too big to keep this from being good. 
5 out of 10"
"Mar 07, 2013",4,"The ""Republic"" has been in shambles for the last decade. It is nearing a civil war where millions will surely die. 

One of the most high-profile targets of the opposition is ""Senator Padme Amidala"" (Natalie Portman) of ""Naboo,"" who escapes an assassination attack thanks to her look-alike decoy, who gave her life to save that of the former queen. ""Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi"" (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice ""Anakin Skywalker"" (now being played by Hayden Christiensen) are dispatched by the ""Jedi Council"" to protect the young politician. Upon their first meeting in the senator's home, she almost doesn't recognizes the former slave she first met on the desert planet of ""Tatooine"" ten years ago. 

What the ""Jedi"" discovers is that the on-going assassination attempts on the senator is just a small part of a much larger plan to cause unrest in the already fragile ""Republic"" which will lead to a war where clones of a bounty hunter will battle in the name of the ""Republic"" in uniforms that will be instantly recognizable to long-time fans of the franchise. 

As the ""Jedi"" goes on his search to find out who is behind the clones, ""Anakin"" and ""Padme"" go on their own adventure and slowly learn that they have feelings for each other. 

The first thing you will certainly notice is the special effects. There is a lot of CGI in this film that is simply fantastic. There is only a couple of things that I had a problem with when it came to the CGI. First, the spaceships looked more technologically more advanced than the original trilogy. I know that there has been advances in special effects, but this trilogy is suppose to be set before the original, which means the technology should have been more advanced in the original trilogy. Another problem is the CG characters, who are still being poorly blended into backgrounds -- which is most noticeable when they share the screen with one or more of the human performers. 

There are stronger performances from the main cast this time around. However, Christensen, who takes over the role from a much younger Jake Lloyd, appeared to have had some problems with reciting his lines and made it appear that he was forcing them from his memory. McGregor, Portman, Christopher Lee (""Count Dooku) and Frank Oz (voice of ""Jedi Master Yoda"") are just a few of the performers who stand out in this film. 

The battle scenes are simply incredible. The space and ground fights are fast-paced, and edited very nicely. And just like the last film, the ""lightsaber"" battles make the ones in the original trilogy look like they were played back in slow motion. 

There is some character development problems with characters introduced in this film. I personally would have liked to have seen ""Count Dooku"" (Christopher Lee, who is best known for portraying ""Count Dracula"" on the silver screen) be better developed since he was the main villain in the film. 

We also get to see many questions from the originally trilogy answered. Especially the start of one of the major plot devices seen in ""Star Wars"" (that's ""Episode IV"" to you kids). 

Despite the flaws, ""Episode 2"" is a good addition to any sci-fi fan's DVD collection."
"Mar 04, 2013",2,Such a let down form the other films
"Mar 02, 2013",4,"It's Star Wars, it offered great insight into one of my favorite franchise eras, and Jango Fett himself!"
"Feb 28, 2013",5,"Honestly, the worst Star Wars film ever made. It is a phenomenal film when put up against other films. A disgrace when compared with the other five parts of the Star Wars saga."
"Feb 28, 2013",1,The movie that almost destroys the star wars franchise
"Feb 26, 2013",5,Love it i would follow anikin to the dark side any say
"Feb 26, 2013",5,"The locations are memorable and interesting; the craggy canyons of Geonosis and the torrential storms of Kamino were immediately imprinted in my head when I first saw them.
The CGI strengthens the film-the action sequences look amazing, from the speeder chase at the film's beginning, to the ending confrontation between the Jedi and Count Dooku. Seeing Yoda finally whip out his lightsaber and fight was very exciting. I don't get why people complain about him jumping around during the fight, though; such acrobatics show an interesting contrast between Yoda's age, and his actual power in the Force, and skill in lightsaber combat. No one would expect a 874-year-old green troll to have such mobility.
Each of the planets is a representation of what is happening on the planet. Coruscant is shrouded in fog, Kamino is shrouded in mystery, and Geonosis is shrouded in violence; each is part of the shroud of the dark side that is ever-present in the film-in one of the main characters, and in the events that move the story along.
I liked the characters of Obi-Wan, Padmé, and Anakin, as well as each of the conflicts and struggles they faced in the film. Again, I didn't agree with the accusations of ""wooden"" acting and ""boring"" characters. When watching the film, I believed that the characters were the characters, not actors playing characters.
Lucas delivered another superb screenplay, with some help from Jonathan Hales, and the politics-as well as the machinations of the Sith, and the slow erosion of the Republic-are fantastically done. Not only that, but the characters are believable and realistic for the situations they are placed in.
The romance between Anakin and Padmé has been ridiculed for being ""cheesy"" and ""clichéd,"" but I think the moments and dialogue between them are believable, given the characters and their experiences. In spite of the fact that Anakin and Padmé's relationship would end in tragedy, I cared about this romance between these star-crossed lovers.
Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones is a wonderfully-done film, and it is certainly worth your time to watch the second episode of the Star Wars saga."
"Feb 26, 2013",0.5,"The purpose of this film seems to be to give context to characters with little or no point to them, in order to justify selling small plastic versions of them later."
"Feb 26, 2013",4,excellent continuation to the series
"Feb 25, 2013",5,i'm a star wars freak
"Feb 24, 2013",3.5,"Far better than its prequel, the clone wars starts weaving the story together and gives us some of the most enjoyable Jedi characters in their heroics."
"Feb 22, 2013",5,5 star's..Love a good star wars film..
"Feb 22, 2013",3.5,"An improvement, albeit problematic.  While heavy on the dialogue the plot and motivations are clearer and the action scenes are a lot of fun to watch.  Plus, there's actually some proper character development unlike Phantom Menace."
"Feb 22, 2013",3,for Star Wars fans only
"Feb 22, 2013",5,Easily the weakest of all the Star Wars films. Too much time wasted on the Obi Wan &amp; Jango Fett Clone plot. This movie stalled the series and only moved it forward in the last 45 minutes or so. So much missed opportunity. On another note it is still more enjoyable than the bulk other movies of that year.
"Feb 21, 2013",2,"Despite some good moments, this is clearly the worst Star Wars film."
"Feb 20, 2013",3.5,"72%
Blaaaah, a lot of people hate this film for the stupid climax that it has, come on the special effects in the last battle scene could be the worst among all the 6 SW films. Every thing that the film builds up is destroyed in the climax."
"Feb 20, 2013",2.5,"The moral of the story: Starwars Romance films dont work.  The fight on Geonosis was cool, but the romance was over rated."
"Feb 20, 2013",3.5,A vast improvement on the previous prequel. 'Attack of the Clones' is alot more sensual than any of the previous Star Wars films. It's relatively lovey-dovey in most parts now that Anakin is a teenager and has discovered 'girls' (cringe!). It's far-fetched albeit worth a good watch.
"Feb 19, 2013",0.5,Sucks like Lucas!  You ruined the saga!
"Feb 19, 2013",2.5,"This film lacks in many respects, but it makes up for them in a giant battle in an arena."
"Feb 19, 2013",3,"I found The Phantom Menace more entertaining than this one. It's a good story actually, the Romeo and Juliet plot ""across the stars"" (two people separated because of their politic status). But Lucas fails again as screenwriter. I don't know what Jonathan Hales did... but he seems to be as bad as George is. The movie itself is boring until the Battle of Geonosis begins. George tried to imitate the same style of ""Empire"" working on two subplots intercalating themselves, but he forgot he is NOT Lawrence Kasdan, the mastermind behind ""Empire"". Good battles, a good villain played by Christopher Lee, a love-story with poor taste, bad screenplay again. Attack of the Clones simply revelas important details for the subsequent episodes."
"Feb 18, 2013",3,I liked the action scenes but it's kind of odd how anakin and padme are just old pals in the beginning and are married in the ending. Still an awesome movie.
"Feb 18, 2013",3,"Lucas's first prequel let audiences down due to the lack of characterization and good dialogue. This one is much the same but the battle scenes are more exciting and the story is starting to emerge in its connection to the originals. The battle scenes are fun to watch and the romance scenes on Naboo are great, but the characters are simply not as inspired as the first trilogy. The film seems personal but the characters seem rather impersonal. Some of this is good and some is dull, but Lucas does manage to keep us wanting for his third installment somehow. I hope it will be better than the first two films in the prequel trilogy."
"Feb 16, 2013",1.5,ugh bad bad bad shit. D-
"Feb 16, 2013",3,"I never knew a young man could have PMS. Only a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."
"Feb 15, 2013",3.5,worse than TPM but still not all that bad
"Feb 13, 2013",1.5,Just a terrible movie. Not even Yoda's awesome skills with a lightsaber save this movie.
"Feb 12, 2013",3,Jango Fett and a lightsaber filled climax more than make up for the poorly developed romance and stiff performance from Hayden Christensen.  Attack of the Clones is a definite step up from Episode I.
"Feb 11, 2013",4.5,One of my favorites!
"Feb 09, 2013",4,"everyone says Hayden christenson is wooden, well duh, he's going to be darth vader, is he supposed to be mr personality?"
"Feb 08, 2013",2,Pretty shitty. A mortal sin.
"Feb 07, 2013",3,"it is still not enough to repair the damage caused by phantom menace, but the visuals are certainly better., though anakin's actor has definitely degraded."
"Feb 07, 2013",3.5,"This film is an improvement on the Phantom Menace. There's no Jar-Jar (THANK  YOU JESUS!), the action's great, the characters Dooku and Jango Fett are awesome, and Ewan McGregor and Samuel Jackson are better in this movie. Also the Clone Troopers are a great inclusion into the Star Wars Universe. The main problem with this movie is the dialogue and the Anakin-Padme romance. The Romance in this movie doesn't work and drags this movie down a notch. Natalie Portman's pretty good in this film, but Hayden Christiansen is a very hollow actor, portraying a whiny Anakin. The two have a very poor chemistry that's almost as bad as Twilight. But overall, this movie is enjoyable to watch."
"Feb 07, 2013",5,"It may be an improvement over the first movie like many people say so and you know what, they're right. This is Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. Over a decade later, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) now aged 20 is an apprentice to Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). Unusually powerful in the Force, Anakin is also impatient, arrogant, and headstrong -- causing his mentor a great deal of concern. The pair are ordered to protect Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), the former queen of the planet Naboo, now representing her world in the Galactic Senate. After another attempt on Padme's life, Obi-Wan and Anakin separate. The young Jedi and Padme fall in love as he escorts her first to the security of Naboo and then to his home world of Tatooine, where the fate of his mother leads him to commit an ominous atrocity. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan travels to the secretive planet Kamino and the asteroid-ringed world of Geonosis.  A vicious battle ensues between the clones and Jedi on one side and Dooku's droids on the other, but who is really pulling the strings in this galactic conflict? The Battle of Geonosis was awesome and the Yoda aka the little green muppet tries to fight Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). When he came on the screen, everyone started to cheer. Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones gets a 10/10."
"Feb 06, 2013",1,"I remember seeing this move as a KID. It was stupid. There was something to do with sand, a queen complaining about everything and some other boring stuff happens. Another terrible movie we shall all forget."
"Feb 05, 2013",4,Kept me interested in the story
"Feb 05, 2013",3.5,"CLONE WARS EVERYWHERE, THERE WERE"
"Feb 04, 2013",0.5,"So after Star Wars the phantom menace comes another disappointing movie. So in attack of the clones, people are trying to kill padme, so anakin has to look after her while obi wan has to find the bounty hunter who's trying to kill her and there's the plot of the film. In this movie you have now Hayden Christensen as anakin skywalker and did I like him better, I can't decide. Probably yes but still horrible actor. Last summer I was looking up the worst actors and he was on it because of this movie. So lets go to my opinions on the movie. So first padmes decoys. So at the beginning of this movie her decoy dies and a few minutes later, she has another one sitting right next to her on a couch. I'm guessing she's gonna die. Then she will get the senate together and discuss who will be her next decoy that will soon die. Next you got ewan megregor as obi wan. He looks like he has a pubic hair beard. Yeah they just put glue on his face and threw pubic hair on. Next you got the scene where the bounty hunter hires another bounty hunter to kill padme. This is the stupidest thing ever. Y would a bounty hunter hire another bounty hunter. That doesnt make any sense. Next you got the scene where the robot is releasing the worms into padmes room anakin and obi wan sense the worms and anakin jumps on her to kill the worms and somehow didn't hit her with his lightsaber and then  obi wan jumps out the window and onto the bottom of the robot while it flys away. There are some stupid things here. 1 wht if the robot was like a bomb so if he jumped onto it he would die. 2 anakin would probably be the one who would most likely jump out. 3 wht if the robot had a gun and shot obi wan. How the fuck does he know that it's safe to jump on it. Next the club where anakin and obi wan have to find the assassin which basically copies the cantina scene in episode 4. A hand gets cutoff in this scene and in episode 4 an arm gets cutoff, very similar. And for the next few minutes its boring. Next is the 50s diner where obi wan goes to find out where a bullet came from. The guys name is dexter jettster. This guys pants keep falling down. Seriously, get a belt. Next is the scene where there's more kids which nobody cares about. Then obi wan finally goes to a different planet called kamino that's like all storms and rain. I will say this. This planet would be cool to live on. I could imagine this being the planet where all the electronics would come from. Next you meet jango fett who's boba fetts dad. Who gives a shit where boba fett came from. No one does. There's a lego figure of jango fett who costs over one hundred dollars. WTF. No one cares about jango. I'm actually happy that he dies later on. Next anakin and padme goes to tattoonie to save anakins mother who is being held by tusken raiders. And after his mom dies, anakins destroys all of the tusken raiders and later says to padme that he should be the most powerful jedi. Next obi wan tracks jango to geonosis where he gets captured by bugs with guns. Then padme and anakin want to go rescue them. So then they end up in a droid factory, where c3po is taken apart just like in empire strikes back. Anakin and padme get captured and them and Obi wan are almost eaten by stupid creatures. Then the jedi show up with clones and they have a fight. At the end, anakin loses his hand and he and padme get married. I know I skipped alot of parts in the movie, but there all boring and stupid. The only other thing I have to say is that it was better than the phantom menace . I'll talk about the rest of the Star Wars movies for the rest of the week. Tomorrow is revenge of the sith. Ttyl"
"Feb 02, 2013",2.5,"The only thing I enjoyed in this Episode II was seeing Yoda take on Count Dooku other than that, Episode II was boring to me, I even found myself preferring the more lackluster script and plot of episode I to this. I think mostly it is because of the wonderful performance of Liam Neeson in episode one that made me prefer it to this movie, because here in this episode II all that is available for me to see is, the Dark Lord getting more grips on the senate and Anakin getting closer to Padme.

Due to the negative reviews that Episode I got, Lucas worked and re-worked on the script of this movie so as to present a more better star wars movie that all will like, the annoying Jar Jar Binks was sidelined in this movie giving fewer lines, as he only spoke like 3 times I think. The most cinematic experience in this new trilogy is the battle between CGI Yoda and 78 year old (that was his age at the time of the movie shooting) Christopher Lee. It was from there you will come to respect Yoda as others do.

The movie takes off 10 years after the end of episode I, with some planets threatening to break away from the republic. Former queen of Naboo and now senator, Padme was sent to the senate by the new queen of Naboo. On her way to the senate an assassination attempt was made on her life. Young Anakin Skywalker and his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi were assigned to protect her with Anakin to watch over her and Obi-Wan to investigate who was behind the assassination attempt.

During their duty Anakin and Padme became close and Obi-Wan stumbled on a larger plot tend to bring about a civil war.

The movie had an overlong story, the dialogue was boring and since I'm watching it at the comfort of my home, I had to pause and walk off sleep. The acting was horrible I just couldn't believe it; Hayden Christensen who plays Anakin Skywalker Obi-Wan's gifted padawan apprentice, his performance was sad and dull I couldn't wait for his screen time to be over each time, his romantic link with Padme is just stupid, she just fell in love like that...?? it was outrageous.

I disliked Attack of the Clones and really preferred the first. The movie did make its money but didn't make as much as the first movie and also didn't make as much as the last, in this second Trilogy of the Star Wars saga. Again I didn't like this movie for anything.

"Feb 01, 2013",3.5,"Despite the awful romantic subplot and some truly jarring dialogue, you can't deny ""Clones"" is an improvement over the disappointing ""Phantom Menace"".  Aided by by Obi-Wan's story, McGregor's awesome turn as the Jedi Knight and some truly dazzling effects."
"Jan 31, 2013",5,The clone perspective after the battle in the Geonosis Stadium was cool. I also like how Lucas shows that Yoda doesn't use the Force for personal gain. He walks in on a cane and then just throws it nonchalantly down and then starts hopping around like the toadman he is. He then uses the force to pick his cane back up after Dooku flees. I wonder if Padme got a tetanus shot for those scratches on her back from that beast.
"Jan 30, 2013",4,"Not as great as the original Star Wars films, but still good.  Personally feel that Anakin was badly cast."
"Jan 29, 2013",1,so much green screen
"Jan 29, 2013",2.5,"Well, it's better than the phantom disaster, however, punching myself in the face is also better then that piece of trash film. Good sfx and score, but again, acting is still missing."
"Jan 29, 2013",4.5,Begun The Clone War Has
"Jan 28, 2013",4,love it!!! Its magnificent. The scene as well as their lines were so inspiring...
"Jan 28, 2013",2,It greatly improves on Phantom Menace with no kid and a straight forward plots. Yet again the characters are dull and the romance uninspired. It pretty much works only to rip off pre-established imagery of the original series
"Jan 27, 2013",1.5,"A step above the first movie in that Christopher Lee is awesome and Natalie Portman is extremely sexy in this movie, but that doesn't change the fact that this movie still sucks."
"Jan 26, 2013",2,"-IGNORE THIS ""OUT OF FIVE"" RATING
2/4
Leaden, disappointing follow up to PHANTOM MENACE. Obi-Wan discovers a secret clone army for the Jedi and Anakin shows his true feelings for Padme (in a  painfully forced romance). Superlative visuals and some astonishing action scenes cannot sustain an overlong and stiff film that serves only as a transition between parts I and III. A+ on appearance, but this movie is unavailing, as nothing much really happens. Sequel: REVENGE OF THE SITH."
"Jan 25, 2013",3.5,It is Star Wars...have not met a Star Wars movie that I did not like
"Jan 25, 2013",3,The love story could have been written so much better. Anakin's character could have been played by someone better.
"Jan 24, 2013",4,"After having to sit and wait to get into the closing ceremonies of Celebration VI, I have to like this. Otherwise it was a waste of time..."
"Jan 22, 2013",4,"Better than Episode 1, but that doesn't take much. I love Star Wars, but George Lucas forgot how to tell stories somewhere between trilogies. Good Fett action in here, though, and I love that Jedi arena fight."
"Jan 22, 2013",2.5,Better than the first but still not that good 5.3/10
"Jan 22, 2013",3,Silly. But funny. George Lucas pulls a Kevin Smith and gives the audience what they want. Namely: Yoda-Man.
"Jan 21, 2013",2,This is must worse than the first one. It feels like a behemoth of uncoherent scenes and elements
"Jan 19, 2013",3,Leaps and bounds better than the Phantom Menace
"Jan 18, 2013",4,"Very well drawn up, and ties in the mythology well."
"Jan 17, 2013",3.5,Won't be good in 3D if it wasn't good in 2D
"Jan 16, 2013",3.5,not as good as the next 4
"Jan 16, 2013",3.5,Pretty interesting. Yoda is definitely surprising. Not enough action scenes though.
"Jan 16, 2013",4,I loved this film natalie portman looked very fit in her skin tight costume and its my second best film of the three new films.
"Jan 15, 2013",2,"Maybe the ""best"" of the new trilogy which is'nt saying much as they all sucked."
"Jan 13, 2013",3.5,"An improvement over Phantom Menace, with blissfully less Jar Jar.  The IMAX cut was the best version - it cut out a lot of the sappy meadow crap."
"Jan 13, 2013",5,A much better romance then twlight and step into the right direction to the real thing
"Jan 13, 2013",3.5,"With better action scenes and less sillyness, but with sappy romance, Attack of the Clones is better than the Phantom Menace, but still needs to improve."
"Jan 13, 2013",3.5,My least favorite of them.
"Jan 12, 2013",0.5,My least favorite movie of all time.
"Jan 12, 2013",4,"I was so happy to hate this less upon watching it again. The love story scenes are far fewer than I remembered (and it's a good thing), and even though Hayden is a horrible actor and an annoying character, the sfx in this one are excellent, if over the top, and Obi-Wan's story throughout is largely what saves it. Plus, the mega Jedi battle at the end is pretty sweet."
"Jan 11, 2013",2.5,"The best thing, and maybe the only reason to sit through this movie, is the great Chistopher Lee as Count Dooku/Darth Tyrannus. Not even good actors like Portman, Christensen and McGregor can save this movie from its terrible writing."
"Jan 11, 2013",3,"HOLD ON...! I saw ALL THREE prequels in theaters when they first came out, but I think seeing them in 3D will bring back memories for me...! (UPDATE: In favor of Episode VII, the 3D re-releases of Episodes II and III have been cancelled, or maybe at least delayed.)"
"Jan 11, 2013",2,Easily the worst in the pre-saga.
"Jan 11, 2013",2.5,Hayden Christensen is not a good actor. The writing is awful and the characters deliver their lines without enthusiasm. Better than the episode 1 but not much.
"Jan 07, 2013",0.5,Lucas continues his rape of the star wars series in this terrible film.
"Jan 06, 2013",2.5,Jango Fett is alright. Too much extrapolation to build to original trilogy. Strained Romance between Anakin and Padme.
"Jan 06, 2013",2,"The most campy and stupid movie of the saga. The acting from Natalie Portman is really disappointing, I know she can do better I've seen it. Hayden Christensen has never been a very good actor. And Ewan McGregor just threw away everything good about his performance in the last movie."
"Jan 05, 2013",2,the main reason for this movie is for its visuals and a story that could have been a lot better
"Jan 05, 2013",4,Good. McGregor grows into the role and Yoda steals the show.
"Jan 05, 2013",2,"After the disappointment of The Phantom Menace, hype for Attack of the Clones wasn't as strong. Sure it had a kick-ass teaser trailer, but it still seemed like the uninteresting Cgi fest that plagued the previous movie. As a result, Episode 2 was only half as successful as its predecessor, and thankfully that means there were only half the victims this time around.

Critical reception for Episode 2 was just about as mixed as Episode 1, with a little more positive ones just for simply having more action and a slightly more interesting storyline. Which is true, but then I ask ""what would you rather have?"" An uninteresting story done mediocrely, or a more interesting story done terribly? Personally, I would take the 1st option any day of the week.

The Good

Compared to our tax evasion and political manipulation plot from the last film, it's kind of satisfying to see a more simple storyline start the film off. This time around, someone is trying to assassinate the newly elected senator Padme Amidala, played again by Natalie Portman. After a near successful attempt on her life, she asks Chancellor Palpatine, played again by Ian McDiarmid, to assign Jedi to protect her and find the assassin. The Jedi assigned to protect her, if you haven't guessed, are Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Ewan McGregor, and Anakin Skywalker, played by Hayden (I am totally firing my agent) Christensen. From there, the movie tries to be a mystery/romance, but unfortunately neither of them really work as well as they should due to huge plot-holes and inane dialogue.

Episode 2 also does a great job at just feeling massive. The scope of Star Wars is something that these movies never lack. The setting is huge, the conflict is huge, the amount of alien life is huge, you get the point. You're introduced to new worlds and species that just get you excited to see what new things this world has to offer.

Also, like its predecessor, the action in this one is also well done (for the most part). Highlights include the space battle in the asteroid field between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, and the huge final battle on Genosis from the arena battle to the gunship chase. They're all handled very well and are exciting to watch. Also, the sound design for the gunship chase is exquisite. 

The villains in this one are also pretty good. Sure they're not as badass as Darth Maul, but they're still memorable and intimidating. The Bounty Hunter Jango Fett, played by Temuera Morrison, and Count Dooku, played by the late Christopher Lee, are a good pair of villains and generate a decent amount of authority. You can tell they're powerful and pose a threat to the Jedi, and you have no doubt that they'll kill anybody to get what they want.

There's also this one funny scene where Obi-Wan force persuades a drug dealer to go home and rethink his life. Something I should've done years ago, but it's too late for me now.

The Bad (and The Ugly)

There is no attention to detail when it comes to the storytelling and dialogue. The characters contradict themselves multiple times and give some conflicting information. One example is that one of the rules of being a Jedi is that possession is forbidden. Next thing you know, Obi-Wan is holding Anakin's lightsaber hilt to his face and says ""This weapon is your life!"" Ok, so obviously possession is not forbidden if one has to cherish this lightsaber as their life.

There's also a scene where Padme and Anakin are having a picnic in the middle of a beautiful green screen set... I mean an open field (because apparently that was too hard of a location to film in). Now what I want to know is why the hell are they in an open field with nobody around when an assassin is trying to freaking kill them!? Granted she probably just wants to get shot so she doesn't have to put up with Anakin Creep-show anymore.

And that brings me to one of the fatal flaws of this movie. The romance between Padme and Anakin is atrocious! Hayden and Natalie share little to no chemistry on screen and it's made even worse when Anakin acts like a sexually disturbed psychopath half the time. There is literally a scene where he's just staring at her, she tells him to stop, he says ""Sorry M'lady"" and still continues to give her this creepy as shit stare behind her back. And the dialogue between them... just read for yourself.

Exhibit A
Padme: We used to come here for school retreat. We would swim to that island every day. I love the water. We used to lie out on the sand and let the sun dry us and try to guess the names of the birds singing.
Anakin: I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everything is soft and smooth.

Exhibit B
Anakin: From the moment I met you, all those years ago, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again... I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you- I can't breath. I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me... what can I do?- I will do anything you ask.
[uncomfortable pause]
Anakin: ... if you are suffering as much as I am, PLEASE, tell me.

Exhibit C
Anakin: Don't be afraid.
Padme: I'm not afraid to die. I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.
Anakin: What are you talking about?
Padme: I love you.
Anakin: You love me? I thought we had decided not to fall in love. That we'd be forced to live a lie and that it would destroy our lives.
Padme: I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. I truly... deeply... love you...

Oh my god. Freaking Twilight is laughing at you guys! And this goes on for more than half the movie people. It doesn't get much worse than this.

Now while that masterful work of romance is going on, Obi-Wan is trying to find the assassin. He tracks him to the water planet Kamino where he discovers that a clone army is being created for the Republic from the DNA of Jango Fett. Why are they being created? Who ordered an army of clones? Hell if I know, it's never explained! Sure fans of the expanded universe know their purpose and can figure out their origin, but with what the movie presents by itself, that's not the case. It brings up their mystery for like 10 minutes, then it just drops the idea and it goes nowhere. The only real interesting thing in this whole movie gets put to the side like it's nothing. Bye-bye! See you in that one book or video game that I have to pay for separately! *cha-ching*

Eventually, we get to the final fight between Anakin, Obi-Wan, Count Dooku, and then eventually Yoda. This has got to be the worst put together lightsaber fight in all of the Star Wars movies. Look at it real closely and tell me something doesn't seem a bit off. In one shot the characters can be swinging to one side, and then from the other in the next shot. There's a section where Anakin gets 2 lightsabers and not only do they switch hands in the next shot, but the combatants also appear to now be on the other side of the set! The next thing you know, the lights go out and all you're seeing is a bunch of random lightsaber swinging in front of the character's faces with no rhythm or reason. When Yoda gets into the fight, and you look real closely, the scene basically a really bad Christopher Lee stunt double randomly doing tricks with his lightsaber at nothing with Yoda digitally inserted in.

The effects in this one are also pretty crap-tastic. You know how I said the effects in Episode I were pretty impressive for their time? Well... Episode II's effects weren't that impressive at all. The green screen is painfully obvious and the Cgi on the droids and the clone troopers are very unconvincing. They also put Cgi over Christopher Lee's stunt double during the lightsaber fight and that looks terrible!

Verdict
Attack of the Clones is by far the worst movie in the Star Wars Saga. Sure it's more interesting than Episode I, but the only real interesting plot point goes absolutely nowhere. From there on, you're just beaten over the head with this terrible love dialogue between two characters that share little to no chemistry! You don't buy it for a second. And sure it still has the epic scope of Star Wars and the battles still feel huge and can be entertaining, but when you have a really poor story execution and conflicting information leading up to it, it leaves no impact. And for that, it is much more painful to sit through than The Phantom Menace."
"Jan 05, 2013",3.5,"Action, intrigue, wholesale slaughter of innocent sandpeople ... best of the new trilogy. Shame they didn't use a real camera."
"Jan 05, 2013",0.5,Attack of the Clones was the movie that made Star Wars forgettable.
"Jan 05, 2013",4,"Episode 2 goes more into the relationship of Mom &amp; Dad Skywalker, but also continues to address things that connect to the original trilogy."
"Jan 05, 2013",2.5,"It's saddening to dislike a Star Wars film when it aspires to be much more than that.  George Lucas is a gifted story teller with vision but this is not executed well in this chapter, nor the rest of the prequels.

The opening first hour of the film is full of bland, uninteresting, and dull characters that action pieces that I can't invested into and screamed fake.  The characters's do get some development but it's slow, and feels very forced.  The script is too Shakespearean to feel in place in a space opera.  The romance lacks chemistry.

Many scenes made me squirm in my seat.  The factory antics from C3PO wasn't funny, and was irritating me to no end.  The speeder jump and droid jump from both hero's were just laughably bad as the characters act in total disregards for their lives.  The CGI whilst too clean and noticeable was grand in scale in it's moments.  The special effects and action range from ridiculously fake to pleasing to look at but rarely engaging.

The finale does have some nice eye candy and great visuals."
"Jan 05, 2013",3.5,"Great improvement over the first episode. Wonderful cast and wonderful story, though at times the focus of characters tends to drift."
"Jan 05, 2013",3.5,Not worth 3D for me... I can't see it and already have it in HD. we want new Star Wars not re-cuts.
"Jan 04, 2013",3,"Intriguing. Visually impressive. Fine action scenes and some of the politic problems we used to see in the first trilogy. However, Natalie Portman is not very convincing most of the time, plus Hayden Christensen poorly stands out as the great character he is supposed to be.
The film is the perfect conection to the original trilogy, things start to make sense, however, the film will remain as one of the worst from the whole saga, mainly because of the romance between Amidala and Skywalker, which seems completely pretended, too false, there's no feeling between both actors.
The best thing: the final fight between Yoda and Dooku and probably Ian McDiarmid in his role, which is  little by little developing magnificly the future emperor he will be."
"Jan 03, 2013",3.5,Hayden Christensen is emo.
"Jan 03, 2013",3.5,"Let's face it... the romance was terrible, the dialogue atrocious, but this movie is saved by Natalie's mid-riff, Ewan McGregor owning his role, and a feeling of pulp fiction in the battle scenes.  Also contains possibly the best and worst moment of the ""Fun with Lightsabers"" trilogy in the same scene: Yoda throwing down.  We all knew he could, but we all also knew he should never have to."
"Jan 03, 2013",4,"Attack of the Clones brings more depth to the prequel series with a strong character study in Anakin's slow descent into darkness. It also brings more of the Star Wars brand of exciting galactic action and enticing mythos, although it does also bring more sloppy writing and confusingly complex stories. Ultimately, just like Episode 1, the prequel trilogy doesn't deserve the overwhelming hate it has accumulated over the years."
"Jan 02, 2013",1.5,Almost But not quite
"Jan 02, 2013",4,Improves upon the previous.

"Dec 30, 2012",1.5,"I can't even tell whether nor not is worse, Phantom Menace or this one?"
"Dec 30, 2012",1.5,"I truly have no idea what to say about this ridiculous CGI-infested tripe of a movie. Hayden Christensen is god awful, and has zero chemistry with Natalie Portman, who just sleepwalks throughout this film. Nothing but Yoda works in this 142 minute snoozefest. I hate this film."
"Dec 30, 2012",4,Cool characters and cast added with many references to the old films with improved CGI.
"Dec 29, 2012",3,"Loved the stuff with Yoda at the end.  Loved Anakin's massacre of the sand people.  But the ""blossoming"" romance between Anakin and Padme was nearly unbearable."
"Dec 29, 2012",4,Better than Episode 1 but not as good as the originals
"Dec 29, 2012",3.5,"Pretty good, though not touching any of the original three movies."
"Dec 28, 2012",3,"Oh, Anakin, hold me like you did on the planet aldkjfl;akdjfa.  You writes this crap?  Oh, that's right, George Lucas used all his good stuff up on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade!  Honestly...Aliens?"
"Dec 28, 2012",5,Oddly my second favorite in the Star Wars saga
"Dec 28, 2012",1,"The worst. Nothing made sense. Anakin goes from cute, responsible kid to complete ass for no real reason, and no one wants to see it. I say, 'the king has no clothes!' Plus, major squick factor that the nice young lady falls in love with the 10 year old she knew a few years back, for no discernable reason. Was she hot for the little kid and waiting for him all this time (gag) or she just likes angsty teenage twerps with overblown egos?"

"Dec 26, 2012",5,Star Wars I like them all
"Dec 25, 2012",4,Lucas delivers a touching love story and gets great performances from his actors. The final act appears to be one of the greatest moment you'll have at the movies.
"Dec 25, 2012",2,"again, good effects, bad acting...on a side note, Portman's outfits keep it interesting."
"Dec 25, 2012",3.5,im a star wars fan yeah wasnt great but good enough lol
"Dec 24, 2012",1,"Although not as bad as episode 1, Episode 2 still lacks anything that made the first trilogy great."
"Dec 24, 2012",1,"Are critics high?!This is an awful movie.Sure,it's nice to see how everything ties in and the affects are decent.However this is the most awful line delivery,with a bland love story that needs feeds into the original films,and it's a important part of telling the story,seeing it done this badly really tears away at the structure of the film.It could have been a lot better.1 star.This is the worst in the entire series of star wars,and I pity the next trilogies fate.God help the fans."
"Dec 24, 2012",2,"I honestly cannot stand this film, absolutely my least favorite of the six Star Wars movies. It feels like a teen drama set on Naboo and I'm not sure that I've seen a major motion picture with Cheesier Dialogue. Absolute garbage."
"Dec 24, 2012",4,The dialougue is horrible and the acting not so but it is entertaining.
"Dec 23, 2012",2,"One of the most painful romances I've ever seen coupled with the most meaningless action movies I've ever seen. I mean, the whole thing is a fight between robots and clones, are we supposed to care about any of these people?"
"Dec 23, 2012",3,Amazing effects as you would expect. There are many essential parts of the story introduced here but at times it does seem a little mixed up.

"Dec 19, 2012",3.5,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones, improves greatly over The Phantom Menace, but it is still very far away of the rest of the episodes thanks to a very slow and boring pacing."
"Dec 19, 2012",3,"They should have used the title: ""Star Wars: the Apology."" Although better than the previous chapter in the series, both the story and characters lack any real depth and the film suffers from mediocre direction.
Not bad, but I was expecting better."
"Dec 19, 2012",2.5,"This film fixes a lot of things that were wrong in the previous one. Things don't feel forces down our throats, the acting is definitely better and things are much more relevant and interesting as well as some improvement in character development- there's actually some in this film. However, there are still a lot of things that are wrong in the film. The first thing to come to mind is the CGI. It's in abundance. In fact it's over used. George Lucas once said something about special effects should only be used as a way of enhancing the story... Not actually being the story. Most of the settings we see are on a green screen and EVERY SINGLE clone trooper and battle droid is completely CGI and so are half of the rest of the characters that we see on scene--it doesn't matter if they're minor characters they could at least have used people in masks it would have looked way way better. And lastly the love story between Padme and Skywalker feels forced not to mention awkward. There's like a bloody ten year difference in age between them. This was certainly not Portman's best performance, it didn't feel like she even wanted to give this film a shot, that she was only doing it for a contract. But Christopher Lee as Count Dooku was good. Awesome actually. He made a good villain as did Jango Fett."

"Dec 11, 2012",3,"The first half of this moviesi s boring, its all politics and boring talk. It doesnt feel like Star Wars at all. In the second half things start to get more interesting and the clone wars begin. PRoblem with the first two episodes is that it takes itself too seriously,its not the star wars from 30 years ago. Overall this is an improvement over the first one so it is okay."
"Dec 10, 2012",1,"Hey, it's a movie. One extra star for getting it done."
"Dec 09, 2012",4,"Not great, but it's still good. They gave it a shot at least. I look forward to watching it again."
"Dec 09, 2012",0.5,"This movie is worse than the abomination known as ""The Phantom Menace""! Terrible writing, terrible acting ( even from the actors that have given out brilliant performances in other movies), and lazy directing.
I first watched this as a 7 year old and I didn't even like it then.

Set 10 years after the events in ""The Phantom Menace"". After an assassination attempt on the life of Senator Padme Amidala, Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan learner Anakin Skywalker are sent to investigate. 
After tracking down the assassin, she is silenced before any information can be derived. 
The two Jedi are then sent on two different missions, Anakin is sent to Naboo with Padme and Obi-Wan to find the elusive Bounty Hunter.
 Little does he know, he is investigating some of the biggest altering events of the Star Wars saga/universe, as Obi-Wan finds out that there is a connection between the assassination attempts and a separatists movement led by a former Jedi against the Republic. The Galactic Republic finds itself at the brink of a civil war while Anakin begins to have a burning forbidden romance with Padme and feelings like anger, hate evolve from the loss of a loved one, thus beginning his descent into the dark...

&lt;b&gt;Hayden Christensen&lt;/b&gt;:  Anakin Skywalker

&lt;b&gt;Daniel Logan&lt;/b&gt;:  Boba Fett

Again as with the first Prequel Criticisms that have been raised with the new films is that there is far too much reliance on CGI scenes and characters and that is certainly true of Episode 2. 
At times, McGregor is the only real thing you see on screen although things do improve for the obligatory trip to Tunisia (I mean, Tattooine). But the magic you felt when you saw Chewbacca for the first time is replaced with bile-inducing hatred when Jar Jar Binks makes a (thankfully brief) reappearance. Other things clash with what has gone before in the earlier films. 

Anakin comes across as less a Jedi and more a psychotic stroppy teenager while Obi-Wan feels like a slightly neurotic mess with more issues than Greenpeace or Oxfam. Not the fault of the actors but more as a result for some really shoddy dialogue which, if we're honest, has never been George Lucas' strong point. There are only so many times you can hear someone say &lt;i&gt;""I've got a bad feeling about this""&lt;/i&gt; without wanting to slap the screenwriter.

What Lucas does do well is action-packed set pieces and here is where Episode 2 steps up to and on the plate and delivers. Aside from the typically climatic battle scenes at the end, the undoubted highlight is the battle between countless CGI baddies and hundreds of light-sabre-wielding Jedi Knights. 
Even though you finally get to see Yoda kick some ass, there is much to disappoint too. Principal among these is Christopher Lee's villainous Count Dooku, who isn't quite as evil or easily to categorize as Darth Maul visually from Episode 1 but he has more sophisticated dialogue and poise. 

Personally, I also find George's obsession with cramming the film with shots of earlier characters (including Boba Fett, Uncle Owen and C3-PO) very annoying - this is supposed to be Star Wars, not Days Of Our Lives in space. And on that subject, the romance between Anakin and Amidala feels a little out of place, it's unrealistic yet being romantic i didn't mind much. Could have been edited or chopped down possibly.
Also to be noted that it slows the whole thing down and juggles with the already complex plot so that the viewer feel disorientated and somewhat annoyed that there is so little &lt;i&gt;'Star Wars'&lt;/i&gt; going on.

So is the film any good? As Master Yoda himself might say,&lt;i&gt; ''a good film fancy visuals do not make''&lt;/i&gt;. Echoes of  &lt;i&gt;Menace&lt;/i&gt; problem.  The answer is yes and no or somewhere in between.
 It looks the part and during the jaw-dropping Jedi battle, you do feel that this is a worthy addition to the series. But only during that scene and a few others - the rest of the time, you're shaking your head with light disappointment. If ever a film series has become a victim of its own success then the three prequels are(&lt;i&gt;Sith&lt;/i&gt; not so much). 

Due to massive expectation (heavily dampened after Episode 1), this film was bound to disappoint but even on it's own,obviously this has not a patch on the earlier three films. However there is a noticeable change and a human emotion element does come into play unlike with &lt;i&gt;Menace&lt;/i&gt;. 

It's entertaining in a mindless way but because you will almost certainly have experience of a Star Wars movie, you'll find yourself wishing the Millennium Falcon would drift into the picture, Han and Leia at the helm. Although you already knew, it's best to stick with the first three human, humour filled films."

Let me get to the bad stuff first to get it out of the way. There is some dullness &amp; not so great acting here, but its passable from time to time, except when it comes to Anakin. He is so whiny. Hayden Christensen is really trying hard, but he mostly comes off whiny &amp; well, trying hard. Padme I don;t like for some reason.
The rest of the characters are improved &amp; pretty good, especially Obi Wan.
The story, a political thriller in space, is actually pretty interesting even if gets a bit dull at times &amp; the ""romantic"" scenes do get in the way.
Now, there is more good than bad here. Like the visuals &amp; SFX look amazing. The action scenes might be the best thing about the movie &amp; the saga. The speeder chase is fun, the fight with Jango Fett is great(better than Boba's at least) &amp; the space chase in the asteroids is a remarkable technical achivement(the explosion is awesome!). But the greatest thing about the movie has to be the last 40 minutes, where its just pure war! Coliseum, beasts, jedies, ships, clones, droids. explosions, C3-PO swearing, lightsaber duels &amp; Yoda!
It has its problems, but Episode 2 has too much great &amp; epic things to out do the bad."
"Nov 21, 2012",5,Almost all good at Episode V...
"Nov 20, 2012",2.5,"Not as bad as Phantom Menace. But still, pretty bad.

The whole thing was relatively aimless story-wise. But the second half- starting from Obi-Wan's fight with Jango- was alright, thanks to some awesome action. And the CGI's a lot better here, but there's still way too much."
"Nov 20, 2012",0.5,"Natalie Portman was really hott. That's all this movie has going for it, I would give it a 0/5 stars but apperantly that isn't plausible"
"Nov 20, 2012",3.5,Vastly improved over the years
"Nov 19, 2012",2.5,My 3rd favorite Star Wars movie.
"Nov 18, 2012",3.5,Star Wars WILL never get old. :) Great movie.
"Nov 18, 2012",0.5,"The only thing worse than the uninteresting kid in 'The Phantom Menace' is a whiny, self-important, bratty teenage Anakin in this movie. I'm not sure how this is supposed to be a representation of Darth Vader, but I can't even see how such an evolution is possible. 

If you'd like to see a believable representation of an evolving Darth Vader, see Pyro in X-Man 2."
"Nov 17, 2012",2.5,"This next chapter in the Star Wars universe, as well as the previous installment, benefits from a considerable amount of brand new visuals, designs and elements related to this overly rich universe, but, as well as its predecessor, lacks the actual spirit that made the original trilogy the space-opera adventure we all love, in exchange, it focuses wrongly enough on the over-use of special effects and action, that eventually forgets to deliver, in terms of characters and storytelling."
"Nov 16, 2012",4,"Hey, it's Star Wars, and they SPENT on the effects."
"Nov 15, 2012",5,Amazing the beginning of the Clone Wars
"Nov 11, 2012",3.5,"Better than the 1st prequel, but still inferior to the classics, The Attack of the Clones shows off some technical prowess that wasn't avaliable in the originals, but even that isn't enough to make this film as good as The Empire Strikes Back or A New Hope, mainly due to laughable dialogue and bad acting from Christensen and Portman."
"Nov 10, 2012",2.5,"So many things bothered me really bad. Why Lucas, why"
"Nov 08, 2012",1,"You would think Star Wars was all about the scenery and 'epic action'... but Attack of the Clones reminds us that the first three episodes were special because of the soulful acting of its cast, and unfortunately, Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman are an abomination on the silver screen."
"Nov 08, 2012",3.5,Decent Star Wars movie. Better than Episode One. Worth seeing.
"Nov 07, 2012",3,"Greater, funner, and more action-packed than its somewhat underachieving predecessor. The CGI is outstanding, battle scenes engaging and characters interesting."
"Nov 06, 2012",2,I only watched this for Ewan McGregor.  It's an OK film in itself.
"Nov 05, 2012",5,Not 3D but 2D I love the battle of geonosis.
"Nov 05, 2012",2.5,"Not up to standard of the first three Star Wars movies made. The dialogue was badly written, puerile and highly derivative. The acting of Hayden Christiansen, Samuel L Jackson and Natalie Portman was poor, but you could probably blame the director for this. However, Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, as well as Christopher Lee put in exceptional performances given the obsessive control restraints enforced by director George Lucas. The film itself was visually stunning, with intricately choreographed fight scenes, which at times seemed too over the top even for a Star Wars movie. (Every light saber duel looked like an absurdly drawn battle between Greek gods. And every Jedi or Sith seemed to be able to engage entire armies single handedly, killing entire legions with a stern glance.) Though this movie looked beautiful and was a big aesthetic step up in the series, even this wasn't enough to save it from being a huge disappointment. Much better than Episode I: The Phantom Menace, but still a long way off in a galaxy far far away from the quality of Episodes IV, V, and VI.

PS. Lucas should be ashamed of himself."
"Nov 05, 2012",3.5,"Better than Phantom Menace. If you didn't like how whiny Hayden Christensen was, maybe you need to realize that he was kind of directed to be that way. I don't think any of that would have made the final cut if he  wasn't."
"Nov 05, 2012",1.5,"There's plenty of bad dialogue in film, and there are also plenty of bad actors. But when you give dialogue as bad as this to an actor as bad as Hayden Christensen it creates some of the most painful moments you will ever endure on the screen."
"Nov 04, 2012",2,Love story? Listen to the John Williams' Love theme and imagine the story than see it. The only thing that kind of succeed is the air of mystery as things hinge on the verge of war. Visual effects still nice.
"Nov 03, 2012",3.5,"I felt closer to the action than in the first one, but it took a little too long to get to the plot."
"Nov 03, 2012",0.5,Red Letter Media- enough said
"Nov 02, 2012",4,"Though not as good as the other 5 movies, this still gets high marks for having some insane battle sequences."
"Nov 02, 2012",2,"Attack Of The Clones takes an even lower step than phantom menace did, due to the lack of creativty and just being plain dull an boring. Overalll Attack Of The Clones tries way to hard to make up for the phantom menace and becomes even less creative and even more dull and boring."
"Nov 02, 2012",2,"a big, no a gigantic mess."
"Nov 01, 2012",3.5,i can't tell the star wars movies apart... haha
"Nov 01, 2012",2.5,"Once again, the prequel trilogy cannot stand up to the originals."
"Nov 01, 2012",3.5,All I have to say is this is still Star Wars.
"Nov 01, 2012",4,Great graphics and a decent story line. Definitely worth checking out but owning it out of place from going all out for the saga would leave you guessing wth is going on.
"Oct 31, 2012",2,A lacking sequel to a lacking prequel.
"Oct 31, 2012",2.5,"Lucas, you're an idiot."
"Oct 31, 2012",2,At least you hardly see Jar Jar Binks.
"Oct 31, 2012",1,"Shitty dialogue, shitty CGI....shitty everything. Probably the worst Star Wars movie in existence."
"Oct 30, 2012",2,"Eh, better than ep 1"
"Oct 30, 2012",3.5,it should be 4.5 stars but something happened and they changed my rating
"Oct 29, 2012",3.5,"The saga continues as the historic clone wars begin, and we see Anakins growth ten years after Episode I, which leads to his turn to the darkside in Episode III. There were some improvements in this one since the last one. However, it was still a disappointment in several areas, such as a few plot holes, and the corny and cliche dialogue, especially between Anakin and Padme. Boy, I was really convinced that they were in love with each other. I mean, I'm surprised I didn't throw up in the theater, I could not believe what I was hearing. Though I do admit it wasn't all bad, but they could've done way better. I could at least see what they were trying to do. There was SO much potential for the relationship between Anakin and Padme, but....it just fell flat. The investigation of the clone army is pretty interesting.....until Yoda decides to....bring the army to Geonosis to begin the clone wars.....for some....odd unknown reason.....What I really liked was the Jedi fight. In The Phantom Menace, it was a real treat to be able to see the guardians of peace and justice actually kick some arse, we didn't see that in the originals. But in this one, we get to see hundreds of them fight an all out battle against the droids. Lightsabers clashing and laser blasts EVERYWHERE. And then it gets way more awesome when the clone army arrives. The Geonosis battle was pretty cool and very fun to watch. But the best part was the duel between Yoda and Dooku. We get to see Yoda use a lightsaber for the first time. Though some don't like it all that much. All around, it was a decent film, and it was entertaining, to say the least. Fighting and action sequences were good and fun to watch. Acting wasn't the worst, but it could have been better. Story line, while it did have some plot holes, was okay. And of course, the effects were top notch, since Lucas seems to like the CG so much....Recommended for any Star Wars fan, just be sure to skip over the so called love scenes."
"Oct 29, 2012",1,I'm not a star wars fanatic. I'm also not into sci-fi in general so this is not something I really enjoyed.
"Oct 29, 2012",2,"Not as bad as The Phantom Menace, but it is still horrible."
"Oct 29, 2012",1,1/2 a star better than the 1/2-starred Phantom Menace.
"Oct 28, 2012",1,"It was awful. I watched this then, afterward, Episode V. I then saw how horrible this really is. Too many effects. Not enough story (at least one that makes sense). The only good thing was that there wasnt a little kid. Thank goodness."
"Oct 28, 2012",2.5,"Still not a good movie, really"
"Oct 27, 2012",1.5,"The plot is okay, but the acting is unfortunately terrible (besides Christopher Lee's)."
"Oct 27, 2012",2.5,The plot is pretty good but the over-reliance on CGI means half of the film is a cartoon.  Thankfully this one has less Jar Jar.
"Oct 26, 2012",3.5,Jango is a cool new character.
"Oct 26, 2012",5,One of the most underrated movies I've ever seen!
"Oct 25, 2012",2.5,Didnt really get into the Episode ones as i did the orginal.
"Oct 25, 2012",3,"More or less on par with The Phantom Menace, the film builds up to that climactic battle in Geonosis. Christopher Lee plays a decent antagonist, but Hayden Christensen's acting was weak, as well as again... Lucas' dialogue work."
"Oct 24, 2012",0.5,"Like its predecessor, Attack of the Clones is an utter piece of shit and a wonderful example of how bad director and writer George Lucas is. Like The Phantom Menace, it is a totally pointless film which you don't care about after seeing it once even if you like it, because the point of the whole prequel trilogy is to tell us the backstory of Anakin Skywalker and how he came to be Darth Vader, and therefore the only one of the three films that matter somehow is the last one, Revenge of the Sith. ""Menace"" and ""Clones"" are empty, hollow, uninteresting and frustrating experiences which only leave you sorrowful.
 
Once again Lucas is more interested in special effects and directing action rather than developing the characters and making the audience care about them. He also has a desperate need to tie the trilogies together by constantly referring to the original one; we get to see some of Boba Fett's backstory, which is totally pointless since he doesn't do anything in the film, then there are numerous scenes in Tatooine which heavily makes us yearn for Episode IV, and then there is a glimpse of the blueprints of Death Star. Lucas may have wanted to bring a feeling of nostalgia with these references, but the only thing they really do is make us yearn for the original films even more.
 
But no aspect of Attack of the Clones has been criticized more than the romance between Anakin and Padmé. And believe me: it deserves every word of mockery it has received, yet it's way too little to describe how dreadful it really is. The dialogue Lucas has written in their mouths is unprecedentedly corny and syrupy, and there isn't an ounce of chemistry or real feeling between the twp; they just stutter that ear-racking dialogue with such looks in their faces that you can clearly see they just want to run away from the set. The result is the clumsiest and most painful romance in the history of cinema.
 
The acting in Attack of the Clones is universally terrible. Hayden Christensen's performances as Anakin in this film and Revenge of the Sith are easily some of the worst ever seen. He is unable to express any kind of true emotion and mumbles his lines with a monotonous voice. The only thing he manages is to make you hate his character even more and more. Ewan McGregor still doesn't bother trying, and Natalie Portman looks ashamed and sheepish. Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Lee are legendary actors, but are completely wasted.
 
Like the other prequels, there's no denying that Attack of the Clones looks great and the special effects are stunning. But it doesn't improve the film anyhow, because it is just completely devoid of narrative coherence, emotional impact and dramatic tension. What we are left with is a sheer mess of a space adventure that makes you want to rip out your hair and cry your eyes out.
 
The consensus of Attack of the clones in Rotten Tomatoes says that it contains more of what made Star Wars fun. Excuse me? In my humble opinion, what really made the original Star Wars trilogy were strong characters that you learned to care about, familiar but powerful good vs. evil -stories and a strong feel of adventure. What the prequel trilogy is made of are one-dimensional and annoying characters, laughably bad dialogue and nonsensical plots. Attack of the Clones is all this as well, and represents it in the purest form."
"Oct 23, 2012",3.5,"It's still meh, but its better than Episode 1 at least."
"Oct 23, 2012",1.5,"""I don't like sand. It's coarse, rough, irritating, and it gets everywhere."""
"Oct 22, 2012",4,It has a lot more suspense and provides a lot more shock in the story than the first episode. It's more fun and a little darker too. Felt less like a family movie and more like a Star Wars movie.
"Oct 19, 2012",3,"Probably one of the worst Star Wars movies. It's actually okay only because its Star Wars, but the plot was boring, not the greatest acting from Hayden Christiansen and it had a stupid romantic subplot. I liked the scene where Anakin was chasing Zam Wesell through Corusant though. The action and visuals were great but the movie falls short just like The Phantom Menace."
"Oct 18, 2012",0.5,Rubbish. Can this be zero stars?
"Oct 18, 2012",4,The weakest in the saga but still damn awesome to see Samuel L Jackson kick some ass aka Shaft!!
"Oct 17, 2012",0.5,This is swiftly becoming one of those films that friends and I find much humor in. The only saving point is the visuals.
"Oct 17, 2012",1.5,WORST of the Star wars films but great visuals
"Oct 15, 2012",3,"An improvement, but only just"
"Oct 14, 2012",3.5,"Though my least favorite in the saga, Episode II continues the wonderful visuals, action scenes, and enjoyable characters, but stints on enjoyable dialogue and pacing. Ought to be interesting in 3D, though.

Verdict: This is a real hamdinger of a movie, so get it on DVD."
"Oct 14, 2012",3,"I don't even know if this movie is better than Episode 1 but at least the plot makes slightly more sense. However, the love story between Anakin and Padme is SO BAD. I don't believe a word that comes out of either of their mouths. Everything is overacted between the two. Why couldn't this movie focus all of it's time on Obi-wan's story. He really carries this movie and saves it from being a complete failure. I found that every time he was in the scene, I was interested in what was happening. But when he wasn't there, the movie just sucked."
"Oct 13, 2012",1.5,Why was this movie even made?
"Oct 13, 2012",2,Just fuck off and die.
"Oct 13, 2012",1,"As a kid, I was totally blown away by the action sequences this film had to offer. Now howver, I do realize how fake all that CGI environment looks. It really is a bad film. The romance was a pain, and the dialogue was straight out awful. But the action scenes still are okay, but jsut as some mindless fun, really. 
The acting isn't really that riveting. Though Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGregor are great actors and do give their all, they can't really help overcoming sme cluny dialogue and boring one-dimensional characters. Probably the weakest film in the series."
"Oct 12, 2012",4,"It's indeed an improvement over Episode I, and like Episode I, I really enjoyed this film. While Anakin can be annoying and the romance aspect is cheesy, I loved the action scenes and the story is much better this time around, making it a more engaging film. The prequels will never match up to the original trilogy, but I still enjoy them as they are."
"Oct 10, 2012",1,"Like its predecessor, this continuation of George Lucas' warped and delusional prequel saga is insulting to fans who have cherished the original Star Wars trilogy for decades, and contains one of the most awkward, forced, and ultimately worst romances in the history of motion pictures."
"Oct 10, 2012",5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Oct 09, 2012",2,Thanks to an obnoxiously forced romance story and a truly horrible performance from Hayden Christensen - Attack of the Clones cements itself as the worst film in the entire Star Wars saga.
"Oct 07, 2012",2.5,"As I stated before, I hold ""Star Wars"" at a very high regard. But this one has to be the worst one of the bunch. Poor dialogue, poor acting (must not be able to help having to act in green rooms for months. No atmosphere to practice your craft in.), poor shot selection, poor cinematography (especially for the guys who are shooting the film.), ... I can go on but, the only things I can say that are good about this film are the 2 obvious. Thank you for limiting Jar Jar Binks' screen time and thank you once again for the nice special effects."
"Oct 07, 2012",2,Attack of the Clones is very cringeworthy at times.
"Oct 07, 2012",4,"The romance between Anakin &amp; Padme is so cheesey! Hayden Christianson is also a pretty bad actor. However.. There are a lot of other elements that I think are great in this film. I like the clone story, etc. Thhe action is also really cool!"
"Oct 05, 2012",3.5,the weakest of all 6 star wars movies
"Oct 04, 2012",3.5,"Attack of the Clones suffers from some very stiff acting and terrible dialogue, but overall it still entertains and delivers."
"Oct 03, 2012",1.5,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Oct 02, 2012",2.5,"Most fans see this as a major improvement over its predecessor. However, this addition to the franchise happens to be my least favorite. The acting is bland for the first half of the movie, the script's an awful letdown, and a lot of the movie just feels lazy. However, when the love story, character studies, and epic battles start to kick in, the movie picks up with a near saving grace.

PLOT:After an attempt to assassinate Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and the now-grown Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned on a mission to guard her from any further disruption. However, Skywalker's rebellious attitude toward life brings the two into a hunt for the potential killer, believed to be a bounty hunter named Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison). In the search, Anakin takes Padme back to her home planet of Naboo for refuge, and Obi-Wan investigates the mystery planet of Kamino, where an unauthorized clone army is being made in the Jedis' favor. Within the investigation, Obi-Wan becomes captured by the evil Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and finds out about his plans for the dark side. Also, Anakin and Padme start falling in love with each other: something forbidden to the Jedi way. With the making of a clone army, the capture of Obi-Wan, and the young rebellion in Anakin's heart, it is evident the clone wars are about to start and the fate of the Jedi is locked in. It's a great plot executed decently.



ACTING:The acting in here is pretty okay. For the first half of the movie, I felt the acting was lazily done. I felt like the actors weren't really feeling their performances until about halfway through the movie. Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen didn't pick up their performances as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker for a little bit. Most of the actors appeared this way, but when they really got into their roles, the performances turned out excellent. Some of the best performances in this movie would have to be from Natalie Portman as Padme, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Frank Oz as Yoda, Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker, and Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine. After the acting picked up, the performances became pretty well done.

SCORE:The score in this Star Wars, still composed by John Williams, is mainly composed of borrowed themes with the exception of a few new and unique themes. The score was pretty alright in this one.

EFFECTS:The effects in this Star Wars have to be some of the best yet. The effects of the great battles between the droids and the clones as well as the details put into the several new and different aliens, such as the Geonosians and the Kaminoans, were brilliantly done. I was really impressed with the effects in this Star Wars.



OTHER CONTENT:This Star Wars movie just seemed to be a great letdown to me. There were many good moments to it, however. The battle scenes, love story, and character study of Anakin really brought the movie together. The battle contains roaring, exciting action, the love story is excellently detailed, and the character study of Skywalker's dark heart is a key part in the overall story with most of the emotion emanating from it. Besides the acting problem, the script was a major kill point for me. The script at a lot of the parts in the movie just seemed too silly, especially the banter between C-3PO and R2-D2 on Geonosis. The script just ruined a lot of the movie for me, as did the lazy feeling of the first half of the movie. The first half of the movie feels lazily done. From the beginning up to either Anakin's search for his mother or the execution on Geonosis seemed fairly lazy. The effects there seemed not as creative, and the acting at that moment seemed to follow. Also, the movie feels very derivative at some points where you can tell they borrowed another movie's cliche. I'm sure most fans of the franchise will disagree with me on all of these points, but I can't help feeling this movie was just pretty out of it for the most part.

OVERALL,a neutral-feeling movie with a great plot, slow-to-pick-up performances, alright score, exciting action, detailed love story, and a key character study drawing the story together, however, the script was ridiculous for the most part, the first half of the movie felt underdone, and several cliches in here felt familiar."
"Sep 29, 2012",3,"Well, better than the first one. Remains to see how episodes three through six are holding up (yes, it's 2012 and I'm watching the Star Wars film series for the first time. Fc.uk me, right?) :P"
"Sep 26, 2012",2.5,"Not much in this movie makes much sense.  The dialogue is stilted and cheesy, but it offers some decent moments against all odds."
"Sep 26, 2012",1,"While Episode I suffers from a lack of focus, Episode II suffers from terrible, terrible writing. Just horrendous dialogue, idiotic choices from the characters, and lazy coincidences. Which film is worse? That is the most interesting discussion we can have about this."
"Sep 26, 2012",5,It's all about those clone troopers.
"Sep 26, 2012",2.5,At least Phantom didn't have Hayden Christensen spend half of the movie badly acting an unconvincing romance. Luckily the chapter skip feature on the DVDs allow you to bypass these to get to the rather nice fight sequences.
"Sep 25, 2012",3.5,"Following the marathon BluRay Star Wars, I watched the Episode II. If we compare with the previous movie, this is better in all aspects. Now if we compare with the rest of the saga, it is still a little behind the pattern. Undoubtedly, the plot is much richer than Episode I and the action scenes are much more exciting. The film spends much of his time showing Palpatine's plan to control the Republic and turn it into an empire. Despite this leave the film slower, you can buy the idea. Likewise, I could buy the romance of Anakin and Amidala, despite the actors' performances are sufferable. Incidentally, this is a burden that all new trilogy carries. George Lucas can not direct actors. About the special effects, much less bother to watch this movie in high definition. It is clear that in many instances the scenario and some aliens seem artificial, but you can overlook when we remember that the projections at the time did not bring such detail. Anyway, if this movie does not shine at least brings back dignity to the saga."
"Sep 24, 2012",3,"Any Star Wars fan that says they haven't seen this multiple times is lying or not a fan. That being said, this chapter can be incredibly boring. It does have redeeming factors though and I rate Star Wars on a different scale than other movies."
"Sep 23, 2012",2,LOL it was ok... LOL
"Sep 23, 2012",2.5,"Ewan McGregor steps it up a bit in the second installment of the new trilogy, however the film still lacks the magic that the original trilogy did, and still has today."
"Sep 23, 2012",0.5,I fell asleep in the theater
"Sep 23, 2012",2.5,"This movie features cool special effects, pivotal moments in the Star Wars universe, and some memorable character clashes.  It lacks believable dialogue and quality acting from it's star character played by Hayden Christiensen"
"Sep 23, 2012",2,"A pointless mess with few moments to admire, other than some impressive, cartoonish action scenes."
"Sep 21, 2012",2,The special effects like all Star Wars movies are amazing. However the acting is very bad. Not only the acting but the script is something from elementary school. The overall story is just so simple it's insulting.
"Sep 21, 2012",3,"Another good Star Wars movie, but still for me it doesn't hold up to the first 3. Kids loved it though, especially Sawyer and the battle scene. Won't stop watching it!"
"Sep 20, 2012",4.5,"31/2 of 4. Again, George Lucas is frequently criticized. Though Ebert gave the film 2/4, he said that he liked EVERYTHING in the film. But he felt that there are things not there. My word? This film is greatly underrated."
"Sep 20, 2012",2,"It Offers the most romance in all of the Star Wars saga, however the chemistry between Christensen and Portman is very weak, and Lucas's direction feels almost as absent as it did in The Phantom Menace. With a whole lot of great sequences very cleverly designed and many references to the original movies and other George Lucas movies (American Graffiti) this is evidently superior than its predecessor, yet haunted by the lack of presence of the first prequel installment. Attack of the Clones is just more than two hours of eye candy that for some might be exhilarating, specially to fans of the saga, but to most it will just be overwhelming and not in a good way."
"Sep 20, 2012",0.5,"""Danger danger, my name is Anakin. My shitty acting is ruining saga."" 
WOW THIS ON BLOWS HARD!!!!!!!  Dam you  George Lucas and slacking. This is just sloppy story telling.

PASS"
"Sep 19, 2012",1.5,"Attack of the Clones is deeply misguided and has far too many unintentional laughs to compensate for the things it does right. It will go down as the ""black eye"" in the saga"
"Sep 19, 2012",2.5,"Hayden Christensen whines, alot."
"Sep 17, 2012",1.5,"So we have learned a little bit from the first.  Jar Jar is limited, and there is more of a story line to follow.  The Clones are cool and the ending is stronger than the first.  But again, Lucas knows we need to see this.  As though he knew that putting out a shit burger in the first one was a ploy to get everyone back for the second.  Such as a star player missing a beat, everyone knows that all masterpieces miss a step.  Well the trend continues.  We are introduced to another shit burger, and again we take a bite.  At least with this one there is a little salt to it.  Anakin and Padme...well...Id rather not, going into that story, We see a little more of a balance for Anakin, but he is more winy than R2D2...can this guy be Darth Vader?  Its like looking at a baby sheep all full of fluff, well in Anakins case it would a filthy sheep who talks to much, but a youngster, and knowing it will soon become a Battling Ram...We just dont bye the transition, nor can it really happen with this guy or lamb into a Ram.  Actually I can understand more why Obi-Wan would turn to Vader than Anakin.  I dont buy that someone as strong as Padme would fall for him either.  The writing is crap once again.  There is little excitement, and we are left with a crispier shit burger"
"Sep 16, 2012",2.5,Definitely better than The Phantom Menace. I rate films out of 4 stars. (2.5/4)
"Sep 15, 2012",2.5,"My Review: 5/10
Date: 4/16/2013
Better than Episode 1, with a more interesting plot and some good scenes.  But the acting, dialogue and love story are really bad.  Hayden Christiansen was not good.

My Review: 7/10
Date: 5/15/2005
This is better than the first, but still not great. The romance scenes are awful - like pulling teeth. Hayden Christiansen is still bad as Anakin. I hope Episode 3 can save the series.

My Review: 8/10
Date: 5/26/2002
I thought Episode II was much better than Episode I. It's probably right up there with the original trilogy. There were some slow points in the first half of the movie, and some of the romance scenes were majorly cheesy, but the ending was pretty sweet. The special effects were awesome, especially all the different alien races. I also liked some of the inside jokes (Obi-Wan to Anakin, ""You'll be the death of me""). It seems like the new ones really miss someone like Han Solo to add in some witty, sardonic repartee. Overall, Episode II was a good movie, and I'm looking forward to the next one. Too bad it's such a long wait!"
"Sep 15, 2012",2.5,"Okay. That's pretty much the best way to sum this movie up. It's just okay. Phantom Menace was an undisputed disaster of a film, and while this one is an improvement over that film, how could it not be? Less Jar-Jar and no Jake Lloyd  give it a huge leg-up, but again, it has a lot of story problems, mostly stemming from plot holes and continuity issues that are open sores from Phantom Menace. Has some decently exciting, if slightly cartoonish action sequences, better emotional depth than the last one (though still pretty wooden), and feels a tad more like a Star Wars movie, though a little bit confusing and confused in terms of plot. Bad movie? Good movie? Ummm.... neither. Just okay."
"Sep 14, 2012",2.5,"Not that great. Very good action sequences and visuals, but everything else sucked."
"Sep 13, 2012",2.5,Again another Star Wars movie that is both badly directed and badly acted. Though at least it's more entertaining and less annoying than Episode I...
"Sep 10, 2012",2,No tan aburrida como la primera
"Sep 10, 2012",3,It's the worst Star Wars but is there really a bad one?  Hayden Christensen's acting leaves much to be desired but it's alright.
"Sep 10, 2012",2,"Mas mierda y basura para el universo Star Wars, pero menos insoportable que el Episodio I."
"Sep 09, 2012",2,Slightly better than episode 1.
"Sep 09, 2012",5,"Love, lightsabers and lots of fun. That is how I would describe this movie. The sweet story of how the little innocent Anakin Skywalker falls in love with Padme Amidala even though it's a horrible idea according to... Well a lot of people in the movie. But lets not forget the lightsaber duels, I am personaly a bit of a fan of that weapon, not to sound crazy! Basically I had a lot of fun watching this movie which almost had it all ;)"
"Sep 08, 2012",3,The real problem with this one is that doesn't feel like a STAR WARS movie.
"Sep 07, 2012",2,"At one time as a kid, this was my favorite Star Wars movie. Oh how times have changed. Attack of the Clones is the worst Star Wars movie ever made, and hopefully it stays that way. This movie is the very definition of disappointing, because every time you think the movie is getting good, it delves back into mediocrity. The movie is plagued by worse acting, EXTREMELY WORSE WRITING, and further butchering of the Star Wars backstory. The good thing about this is that it is not the hardest to watch. There are many more entertaining scenes in this than in Phantom Menace. The problem is that they are either destroyed by terrible acting, or ruined by obvious CGI and greenscreen. Most of the visuals are great, but they are too obvious. The acting, more specifically Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, is atrocious. The only good performances are of Ewan McGregor, Frank Oz, Christopher Lee, and a few others. Everyone else is either boring, or unbearable. The writing, especially in the Naboo ""romantic"" scenes, is so forced and awful that it is impossible to cringe. The chemistry between Hayden and Natalie is nonexistant and just as ""forced"" as this trilogy. Many scenes involving Obi-Wan's story was interesting, and the fight between him and Jango Fett is a highlight of the movie. The interesting stuff, however, is intertwined with the awful Anakin/Padme storyline. The last 45 minutes of the movie picks up in action, yet you never feel like the characters are in danger. The arena scene is cool to watch, yet feels unnecessary. The final lightsaber fight between Anakin and Dooku is awful, and Yoda's fight is awesome yet stupid. The movie treads on to a point where you get bored even in the action scenes. It is really hard to see how people can defend this movie, and say it's better than Phantom Menace. This is, in my opinion, the low point of Star Wars. Lets hope Abrams, Johnson, or Trevorrow don't sink any lower. 4/10"
"Sep 07, 2012",0.5,"Out of all the Star Wars prequels, Attack of the Clones appears to get the easiest ride. The Phantom Menace is held up as the epitome of terrible filmmaking, while Revenge of the Sith is accepted (albeit grudgingly) for tying up the origin story of Darth Vader. Attack of the Clones is the one that no-one seems to moan about, leading us to believe that it is completely forgettable and therefore not worth getting mad about. Unfortunately, that becomes impossible when we realise how truly terrible it really is.

It took a long time for me to decide whether Attack of the Clones is actually worse than The Phantom Menace or simply as bad but in a different way. Both are complete betrayals of the ethos and execution of the original trilogy, both of them are infantile to the point of madness, and both of them resemble a headache-inducing mix of video games and had fan fiction. The answer lies in understanding exactly what kind of betrayals we are talking about, on top of its obvious flaws as a piece of filmmaking.

The Phantom Menace betrays the original trilogy because it deviates from them so markedly. Whether it's midichlorians, Jar Jar Binks, or a plot about taxation, the first film contains countless elements that have no place being in a Star Wars film. Attack of the Clones also contains huge betrayals, or at least moments which seem greatly out of character. But it also contains something more offensive: it borrows greatly from the original trilogy in a desperate attempt to demonstrate that all its departures are somehow in keeping with the story and imagery of the wider saga.

Whole sections of Attack of the Clones feature Lucas borrowing from the original trilogy. The Clone Army are essentially first-generation Storm Troopers, while the fleeting reveal of the Death Star and the numerous scenes on Tatooine make us cast our minds back to Episode IV. The bar scene is like the bar scene in A New Hope, the sequence of a ship clinging to an asteroid is straight from The Empire Strikes Back, and the set-piece in the arena is very close to Return to the Jedi (and Gladiator).

You can't blame Lucas for wanting to give the fans something closer to the original trilogy, in order to mitigate the backlash from The Phantom Menace. But all these scenes do is leave us longing for the originals even more, or trembling in fear at the prospect of Lucas remaking them with modern technology (he's promised not to, but don't count on it). It's a catastrophic error of judgement by Lucas, since we are now more likely to feel betrayed by the bizarre tonal shifts, stupid visuals and terrible dialogue he foists upon us, with even the slightest deviation from the story or spirit of the originals being magnified in attention and annoyance.

There are whole sections in Attack of the Clones which make you want to rip out your hair and scream at the blatant and cynical disregard for continuity. We always knew that C3PO's main role was prissy comic effect, but that's no excuse for such groan-inducing puns as ""is my head on straight?"" and ""I'm beside myself"". There is no explanation given for Yoda's ability to suddenly do back-flips, despite the fact that he spends most of both trilogies hobbling around with a stick. And then there's R2D2 having rockets which enable him to fly, which would have been useful on Dagobah but serve no purpose here other than create an excuse for another toy.

As if that wasn't enough, the film manages to botch the introduction of Boba Fett. Fett is considered one of the coolest characters in Star Wars, with fans even using his first appearance to justify The Star Wars Holiday Special (yes, such a thing exists, and it's worse than the prequels). But Lucas fails to realise that Fett's appeal is rooted in his mystery: we have no idea where he came from, we just know that he means business. In Attack of the Clones, he does nothing of any significance and is given a cheap Batman-style origin with his father being killed by Mace Windu. As with Vader, the prequels take a threatening, enigmatic villain and turn him into a little boy who just needed closure. Perhaps that's how bonded in The Empire Strikes Back?

As with my review of The Phantom Menace, everything I've covered so far could be dismissed as the rantings of a disillusioned fanboy. But even without the obvious betrayals, or the stuff with Boba Fett, Attack of the Clones is a horrendous film in every aspect of its production. If the first film demonstrated that Lucas really couldn't direct, this is the film that demonstrates for all time that he definitely cannot write.

Perhaps no film since Xanadu has had such a complete disregard for the cinematic rule of 'show, don't tell'. We are asked to accept so much because we are told it happened, rather than emotionally bonding with the characters in the way that makes it seems real. For example, we are told that Anakin and Obi-Wan are friends, but all they do is fight, bicker and moan about each other's arrogance. They seem so genuinely uncomfortable around each other, that it's no wonder Anakin turned went to the dark side to get away from him.

The plot of Attack of the Clones is full of gaping holes, and like its predecessor there are too many of them to cover without turning this review into a list. In short, Lucas continues to throw pointless nonsense at us in order to pad out the prequels and put off the creation of Darth Vader for another two hours. His various plot points serve no narrative purpose, nor do they add weight to Anakin's universe: they only serve to confuse us more and make the Jedi look idiotic. For all their knowledge of the Force, they aren't in the least bit surprised that a clone army has existed in secret for the same amount of time that Sidious, sorry, Palpatine has been the Chancellor.

But no aspect of Attack of the Clones is more nonsensical, or painful, than the romance between Anakin and Padmé. Lucas' romantic dialogue is so corny and misjudged that it makes even the worst rom-coms look like Annie Hall. Anakin isn't the least bit charming or appealing: when he's not moaning or sulking, he's trying to woo Padmé with dialogue that would be more at home in a serial killer film. But rather than running a mile while she still can, Padmé goes along with it because the wider plot requires them to eventually have children. It's quite possibly the worst romance in the history of cinema, producing either despairing apathy or downright hatred for these characters.

The acting in Attack of the Clones is every bit as bad as before. Ewan McGregor is trying hard, but the only difference between then and now is that he spends more time shouting at people. Hayden Christiansen is the definition of wooden, looking completely out of his depth and being unable to deliver any of his lines with any convincing emotion. Natalie Portman spends every scene looking like she desperately wants to escape, as if being imprisoned in the dungeon from V for Vendetta would be less of a torture than having to wear those outfits. Even Christopher Lee can't save it, making the very least of a boring character an unconvincing fight scene.

On top of all this, the action scenes still look like a bad video game. Every one of these scenes finds Lucas cramming the screen so full of pointless stuff that we can't make out any of the details, or bond with any of the characters. The car chase at the beginning not only rips off Blade Runner and The Fifth Element, but it's so chaotic and poorly edited that we simply don't care who's chasing whom or why. The fights are so incoherent and absent of tension that we start longing for Lucas' dialogue scenes. Even if people are just walking into rooms and explaining the plot, at least we can make out who's delivering the exposition.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is a mind-numbingly terrible follow-up to The Phantom Menace. As a piece of filmmaking in isolation, it's every bit as baffling, offensive and incompetent as its predecessor, but once you take the issues with series continuity into account, it ends up being marginally worse. It's a cynical, nonsensical piece of vomit-inducing garbage, and the product of a truly delusional mind. Our only consolation is that there is only one more prequel to endure, before we can finally get to the good stuff."
"Sep 07, 2012",1,"After the original terrible entry into the prequel trilogy, this movie continues in it's predecessor's footsteps. Firstly, by introducing an unlikeable Anakin and setting up an unrelatable love story, secondly by ruining many important moments in the classic trilogy from training with Yoda to the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin. Most of the film feels like it's trying to be Empire Strikes Back without knowing any of what made that movie good in the first place."

"Aug 21, 2012",3,"What makes Episode II lack behind the other prequels is that it focuses too much on drama and speech, while the superb action occurs near the end of the film.

"Aug 11, 2012",1.5,"Episode II's wretched title should be an indication of how horrible this film is.  It suffers from the same problem as the fourth Indiana Jones film: I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it wasn't so closely associated with such a fantastic original trilogy.  Hayden Christensen's weak and whiny persona continue the ruination of the Darth Vader character, and it's pretty obvious that Padme is worth nothing more than her looks.  The story is flashy yet muddled, and there isn't enough CGI in the world to hide the wooden acting.  Ewan McGregor does what he can with a lacking script, but it's not enough.  Oh, and Lucas already ruined one classic villain by portraying his childhood, so he thought he'd do it again by showing Bobba Fett's roots.  All the stormtroopers are clones of his dad?  Really?  Another pointless coincidence in the series.  The final battle tries to be epic but manages to ruin the mystery of the clone wars established in the original trilogy while it's at it.  Stick with the old VHS versions of the first three films.  There's nothing to see here."
"Aug 11, 2012",1.5,Easily the worst of the Star Wars movies. People complain about Anakin from the first prequel but this one is FAR more annoying.
"Aug 11, 2012",3,"tar Wars: Attack of the Clones, and the 2002 film directed by George Lucas again .. fifth Star Wars film and second in terms of chronology. The film goes back 10 years after the events in The Phantom Menace and observe her Anakin (Hayden Chirstensen) now 19 years being a padawan. Now the galaxy is at war imposed after the rebellion by renegade Jedi Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). Anakin wants to show his feelings to Padme (Natalie Portman) although this would endanger their political and religious careers.

the film also becomes disappointing as its predecessor, but this is better than The Phantom Menace. because in it we see a little more development in the plot leaving a little child as it did before. and again, the film fails in his script. and again abused the special effects and Star Wars is a very superficial.

Attack of the Clones is disappointing in terms of script and digital overuse as we mentioned before .. but what is better than The Phantom Menace .. is."

When the creator is only making the movie to make more money after he's milked everything out of the original trilogy with DVD re-releases and special editions and has no passion for what he's doing, it's hard to like it and get invested in it yourself."

"Aug 04, 2012",3.5,"Hayden Christensen, for all that he's great to look at, just isn't the greatest of actors, and I hate Obi-Wan's hair, but I still enjoy it.   Yoda in a light saber battle, enough said."

"Aug 03, 2012",4,"""Attack of the Clones"" shows more seriousness &amp; some tension than the kiddy ""[The] Phantom Menace"". Fair acting, but great combat scenes, plus the story/ characters developing more &amp; more make this film decent to watch."
"Aug 03, 2012",3.5,"This sequel of the prequels (Ugh...) got increasingly more gimmicky as the series went on. Again an above average score plainly on the visuals, and yet another exceptional fight between Jango Fett and Obi Wan, it could not be saved by the polished CGI that it relied on for Episode I. Episode II has annoying leads, a whiney Anakin Skywalker and the most AWFUL love story potrayal ever to be shown in the world of film. This movie is fine if you can turn off your brain and just look at the pretty lights on screen. Oh... it has lightsabers, which might just be enough for you."

"Aug 02, 2012",5,"Even after the disappointing reviews given to The Phantom Menace, George Lucas still continued the story detailing how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. With Attack of the Clones, Lucas succeeded in delivering a solid entry in the saga with some improvements over The Phantom Menace. The characters are well developed here. Ewan McGregor is much more charismatic and energetic as Obi-Wan, who felt too much like a side character in Episode I and here you could see him grow older into Alec Guinness' wise hermit from the classic trilogy. Hayden Christensen hits the right notes as Anakin Skywalker. Some critics have panned his performance as whiny and petulant but I thought he did a relatively good job at portraying a younger Darth Vader and has some great scenes where he shows his range. The acting and the story here are generally better than in Menace and the visuals are still as great as ever with some of the best set pieces in the entire saga. The themes of war and democracy are also deeply explored here with a stunning backstory about the Republic and foreshadowing of its eventual collapse. The final minutes of Clones are stunning and somewhat melancholy as well foreshadowing the horrible events in Episode III."

Not only do we get a more worst actor than the previous terrible kid actor, we got a cheesy love story between Anakin and Padime and most of there scenes involve Anakin talking about how he hates sand, which is kinda strange since he lived in a planet WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF SAND! And the scenes get more worst when Padime says the most cheesiest line ever.

''I'm deeply....falling...in love with you.''

HOW DO YOU GET NATALIE PORTMAN TO SAY A LINE THAT BAD! And then after the horrible love story we get this bland story about how Anakin finds his mother dead and slaughters a bunch of people and saying

''THEY DESERVE IT!"" *Anakin runs in his room and whines in his pillow*

Don't watch this movie at all..just don't, its so much more worst than the previous one by adding a horrible adult actor, a cheesy love story with stupid lines and Anakin slaughtering people, even the younglings....NOT THE YOUNGLINGS! For killing his mommy....*sighs*."

"Jul 23, 2012",1.5,"After the release of ""The Phantom Menace"" and the humongous rage the fans unleashed, Lucas gave them the second chapter of the prequel trilogy: ""Attack of the Clones"". The original trilogy has the ongoing debate of which is the better instalment, one or two, and ironically the prequel trilogy has the opposite debate: Which is the worst film? ""The Phantom Menace"" or ""Attack of the Clones""? 
This was the first Star Wars film I saw in theaters but I had already seen the original trilogy and I first saw ""The Phantom Menace"" after ""Revenge of the Sith"", and to all of you saying these are kid films (that includes Lucas himself) I fell asleep in the theater, that says everything for me. Again let's address the good of this film: The final forty minutes are dumb and go against the essence of Star Wars, but it is pretty impressive regarding CGI and action. But other than there is nothing else that's not awful. The production design is not existent as it is all replaced by an excessive use of CGI, awful dialog that even makes me laugh at it, Lucas amateurish direction is now completely focused on the CGI instead of trying to create a story to tell, the worst and creepiest romance in recent cinema as it is forced, painful to watch and extremely unbelievable; again all the new characters are extremely forgettable, a story that's more focused than last time but it is so dumb, hilariously convoluted and overall meaningless as it is all tell don't show (sure, they tried to show us but they just couldn't execute); some of the beloved characters of the franchise aren't represented correctly (Yoda in particularly), the inconsistencies with the original trilogy continue to increase, the new locations/characters/equipment doesn't fit in this universe (they come off as ""The Fifth Element"" or ""Blade Runner"" rip-offs) , and Lucas tried too hard to mimic ""Empire Strikes Back"" (it almost comes off as desperation)and this shows that he is not the reason why Star Wars Original Trilogy was the masterpiece it was. 
I admit that I hate the fans that say ""George Lucas ruin my childhood"", but I honestly can't stand this film as he just butchered this backstory just for CGI and merchandise. 
""Attack of the Clones"" can only be summarized by quoting the work of Shakespeare: ""A tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing"". Unlike, ""The Phantom Menace"" this has no redeeming qualities (no, a 40 minute CGI ending doesn't even come close), you may argue it is more entertaining but it still has more flaws than ""Phantom"". The ultimate proof that Lucas doesn't care about story (he wrote this ""story"" on a weekend!), he only wants to push CGI further and sell more merchandise."
"Jul 22, 2012",3,George Lucas lost it.  Ewan Mcgregor saved it.
"Jul 22, 2012",5,"Yup I'm biased toward Star Wars so so much. This movie takes place ten years after The Phantom Menace. Anakin is about 20 now and basically the movie is about his love for Padme growing even more. The start of the Clone Wars also begins and seeing it now reminds me of how complex the storyline is actually. On the surface is looks like a bunch of Jedi's just fighting Super Battle Droids, but theres a lot of treachery and back stabbing going on. The Yoda vs. Dooku fight is probably what most people remember from this and it's definitely fun to watch, but the thing that stands out here is how much Hayden Christensen overplays his role of Anakin. The writing itself takes a hit here with such cheesy dialogue I'm glad in episode 3 he fits into the role a lot better. But, overall still a Star Wars film so yup 5 stars it is."
"Jul 22, 2012",3.5,Visual effects and finale duel make the movie a flat movie much better
"Jul 22, 2012",2.5,"Though a big improvement over the last Star Wars film, it still contains some of the inconsistent plot holes and bright flashy sequences. Less sluggish and boring, but could have been a lot better."
"Jul 21, 2012",2.5,"After the devastating catastrophe that wasÂ The Phantom Menace, George Lucas pumps out a sequel to that film which are prequels to his originals, but he only directed one of those technically. Let's review this bad boy. The first film was a ploy to make more action figures and video games, the second had about the same motives. This time around we see several new faces, yet after which we wish to never see them again. Ewan McGregor returns, and this time he is accompanied by Hayden Christiensen, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Christopher Lee. Once again, it is directed by George Lucas. You know those movies that have allot of non stop CGI action and zero character development? Sadly, that's this film in a nutshell.

""Attack of the Clones'' takes place several years afterÂ Menace.Â Anakin Skywalker (Christensen), is now training to become a Jedi under the teachings of young Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor) arguably the best actor and best casting choice of the prequels. Anakin is struggling to control his feelings. Obi-Wan is concerned for him, while Chancellor Palpatine has his eye on Anakin, and not in a very subtle way. During this main plot, Obi-Wan discovers a planet where Jango Fett is creating a Clone army. Once again, the Trade Federation (The Frog Heads), are plotting and twisting their mustaches. The Clone Army is being bread to fight against the Federation's droid army. Meanwhile, Anakin and Padme are developing a romance. Eventually everyone ends up at Geonosis, where a battle breaks out between Jedi, Sith, droids, Clones, creatures, and battleships.

The performances in this film are utterly terrible. Hayden Christensen is the worst actor to ever appear in the entire saga. Yes, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford aren't the best actors, but they are totally believable and likable. Christensen is dry, unbelievable, and laughable. He sucks the life out of every scene he is in. Natalie Portman, whom I am not a fan of at all, does nothing to advance the plot. She screams, tears off her clothes, and falls constantly throughout the movie. Much like her daughter Lea, she is extremely sexist. The best actor in the film is Ewan McGregor. The guy looks like a younger version of Alec Guinness, and he can act. He puts everyone else to shame. Christopher Lee is barley in the movie. but when he is he is pretty decent. However, it felt like he was just playing a wizard, which he has already done before.

The positives in this film are more than episode one, but still not enough to save it. The CG effects in this one are much better and look really good. Especially on the rainy planet (don't really care what it's name is), and in the city at night. The action scenes in the film go from very entertaining to very dull. The city chase is probably one of my favorite sequences in the film. It's really thrilling and exciting. There is some humor this time around. Obi-Wan uses some old fashioned Jedi mind tricks and it's hilarious. Thankfully, we barely see Jar Jar in this one. It seems Lucas wised up and saw the reactions to this buffoon. 

The main problem with his film is the acting, the characters, and the battles towards the end. I couldn't get into any of the characters. Nothing drove the movie. The narrative if the film is really slow and choppy. There is no character development at all really, and the battles at the end were slow and cringing. At first it was really cool to look at. After a while it was like watching Transformers. Too many explosions and to many lasers. With the originals it was all about the subtleties. Sure their were big fights and battles but they weren't mega huge. One of my only problems with Guardians of the Galaxy was that the villains were disappointing and that the battle at the end was way over the top. Difference is, the acting and characters in that film are fantastic! 

Sadly ""Attack of the Clones'' is another disappointing Star Wars movie, though it does have is moments. The script is ok, the dialogue is forced, the acting is bad, the music is great, the action gets way to bloated, and it's lacking in nostalgia."
"Jul 21, 2012",3,"Hayden Christensen was a terrible choice for this role in 2 and 3. They should have had a much better actor playing grown Anakin, who could have portrayed his turn to the dark side realistically. Leonardo Dicaprio maybe? Someone who's actually a good actor."
"Jul 20, 2012",4,"While large in scope and sporting improved acting over The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones still doesn't quite reach the heights of the original trilogy."
"Jul 20, 2012",2,Literally nothing memorable happens during this movie.
"Jul 20, 2012",3.5,Improvement over the last prequel movie but poorly executed love story. Hey its got Jango Fett and Clone Troopers right?
"Jul 19, 2012",3.5,"Ok, this was an improvement from The Phantom Menace.  Acting improved across the board (reducing Jar Jar Binks was a big help in that department).  Special effects took a jump with locations like Kamino and major battle scenes.  Story splits between an investigation side and a romance side.  Music held up ok, but not anything special.  One thing I will give it thumbs up for: the final battle.  Overall, this was ok, but still lacking the strong presence of the original three."
"Jul 17, 2012",3.5,"Personally, I love this movie. The action was cool, Jango Fett was a boss and Yoda was in a fight? I think its quite an improvement over Phantom Menace. This was a bit more adult and honestly reminded me of Empire. Not a perfect film, the love story needed more work, but hey, I'll take it."
"Jul 17, 2012",3.5,"I really like the special effects, but this romance is bullshit"
"Jul 17, 2012",5,george lucas has another master piece
"Jul 17, 2012",2.5,Bad acting &amp; Yoda being too silly.
"Jul 17, 2012",3,"An improvement over The Phantom Menace, but still not a great movie. The film is once again overun by the visuals - George Lucas made an improvement with the story but still the acting is mainly corny and dual. It does improve over Episode One but, still it falls flat."
"Jul 17, 2012",1.5,the worst star wars movie created by george lucas
"Jul 17, 2012",4,"Despite some clunky dialogue and wooden acting, there's enough in attack of the clones to make this a hugely entertaining movie. Christopher Lee is excellent as Count Dooku, whilst Yoda gets his moment in the light to prove what a truly bad-ass little Jedi he really is. Mercifully, Jar Jar Binks is demoted into a background character."
"Jul 16, 2012",1,Not as funny as the first.
"Jul 16, 2012",2,"For me I did not enjoy this, it had a good ending but and there was some development but it fell a bit flat."
"Jul 15, 2012",3,Hayden Christensen ruins an otherwise solid movie.
"Jul 15, 2012",2,"The weakest Star Wars installment, ""Attack of the Clones"" attempts to develop a love story and falls somewhere between a Danielle Steel story and a Julie Roberts chick-flick, with cringe-worthy dialogue and stodgy acting. Williams music manages to mantain quality, but could not salvage this movie, even from across the stars."
"Jul 14, 2012",5,Glad to see Boba Fett again.
"Jul 14, 2012",5,pretty damn good for 2nd episode.  We learn how the clone wars begins..
"Jul 13, 2012",1,"I went into Attack of the Clone with the attitude,'It's gotta be better then The Phantom Menace'. Turns out, unfortunately, it's worse. AOTC fails on many levels. The biggest is 'fixing' what Lucas screwed up in TPM. Having one of the main protaganists be a 9 year old portrayed by an actor out of his depth was one of the things that ruined that film for me. Lucas fast forwards 10 years so Anakin is now an adult that should be easier to identify with. Unfortunately, he's written as a disrespectful and often annoying teenage stereotype. It's almost as if Lucas wanted to convey that Vader was an asshole even before he was mutilated and turned into a cyborg. I didn't need a whole other film trilogy to get that point across. What I was looking for was the story of a genuinely good person that falls from grace. Instead we get a story about a whiny Jedi apprentice that seems to have constant contempt for the people around him. Anakin is never a likable character. Half of his dialogue consists of him complaining. By the time he (SPOILERS) gets his arm cut in half during the final battle scene, I was actually thinking 'serves him right'. 

Then there's the 'love' story. Because Lucas cast two actors with roughly 8 years of age difference in TPM, there was never an appropriate way of establishing a love story in that film. The connection between Padme' and Anakin was reduced to a baby sitter who's charge has a crush on her. So when the AOTC tries to establish a relationship between these two, it feels creepy right out of the gate. What's even worse is that the relationship hasn't changed at all. Anakin still has a crush on Padme' yet she still see's him as little kid and for the most part, so does the audience. To make matters worse, the love story is so one sided. Literally until 2 thirds into the movie, Padme' shows little to no interest in Anakin romantically. So many of the scenes between the characters were cringe inducing. It boiled down to Anakin making some sort of advance and Padme' awkwardly shooting him down. But, magically at the end of the film, the two get married. It felt so forced and out of place. Had this arch been handled better, I could have enjoyed this film. But it was handled so clumsily that it literally ruined the entire prequel trilogy for me."
"Jul 12, 2012",2,a boring movie with bad acting and bad writing that grows tedious by the end.
"Jul 12, 2012",3.5,"This was pretty good, but still lacked the magic of the films in the original trilogy."
"Jul 12, 2012",4,"Because it's a Star Wars movie I almost feel obligated to list this as four-star, but it's definitely my least favorite of all the Star Wars movies.  Ewan McGreggor saved this film from being a total flop.  He does such a great job as Obi-Wan (and Alec Guinness's shoes are pretty hard to fill).  I still can't believe they picked Hayden Christensen as Anakin.  It really doesn't work.  Don't ask me who would work,  but it wasn't Christensen."
"Jul 12, 2012",4,Another great movie in the world of star wars
"Jul 11, 2012",2,Features a terrible opening sequence.
"Jul 08, 2012",4,"You watch a film for once, but when it comes to a Star Wars film, you can watch it over and over again without getting bored because of its epic story."
"Jul 07, 2012",1,"A disaster. It's not just a bad movie; but a bad Star Wars movie. Most of the story is exposition setting up the countless merchandising that follows afterwards, and the second act is so painfully cringe-worthy that it just could be my least favorite second act in a movie, ever. The film isn't also aided by a potential storyline that goes nowhere, as well as a nonsensical first act. The highlight among all of this though is the performances from Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid; and the tremendous score from John Williams."
"Jul 05, 2012",4,Better acting in this one than in episode 1
"Jul 05, 2012",5,I LOVE STARWARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ALWAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 04, 2012",3,"Though a major improvement over the first installment, the second installment in the Star Wars Saga is much more complicated and plot hole ridden than it should be but a better time at the movies than ""Menace"" due to it's terrific effects and action sequences"
"Jul 03, 2012",1.5,Why were the prequels even made?
"Jul 03, 2012",1.5,"Effective as mindless entertainment only if you don't consider it on the same level as the original films, however, Attack of the Clones does manage to outdo its predecessor."
"Jul 03, 2012",5,"Loved it, really good effects, no jar jar."
"Jul 02, 2012",5,"Good meld of genres: Mystery, Romance, Action, and War."
"Jul 02, 2012",5,its really the 5th movie lol .. but cool
"Jul 02, 2012",2.5,"Hayden Christensen may be one hot piece of meat but that doesn't excuse his and Natalie Portman's bad acting. They needed a better script and to drop the Kristen Stewart faces. However, it is Star Wars and this nerd just can't quit George Lucas and his sci-fi ways."
"Jul 02, 2012",1.5,By far the weakest of the Star Wars Saga
"Jul 02, 2012",3.5,The ultimate villain has to start somewhere.  And wouldn't you think he'd be some whiney emo kid?!  Only makes sense.
"Jul 01, 2012",3,Hayden Christensen is just so nice to look at.
"Jul 01, 2012",4.5,"Thank goodness that the second chapter contained improvements. Attack of the Clones is breathtaking, both in the visual and emotion senses. The characters have grown, the story has become more interesting, and the wait for the final chapter is almost too much to handle. The only problem: why Hayden Christensen?"
"Jul 01, 2012",3.5,The worst of the 6 movies but still would watch them all.
"Jul 01, 2012",4.5,"First things first, I'm a Star Wars fan and will watch anything associated with Star Wars. This film is on par with the first, better because there is no Jar Jar Binks among the main characters. In response to the poor dialogue, NONE of the movies, including IV, V &amp; VI, had good dialogue. But that's not why fans love it. This film delivers on what counts.... The Star Wars mythology."
"Jul 01, 2012",2.5,"The worst of the series. Hayden Christensen as Anakin is an epic case of casting  gone seriously wrong.. he looks more like a immature, stubborn boy than a 'chosen one' with misplaced idols. You simply can't accept the fact that this guy can grow to be the legendary Darth Vader. The romantic story between Anakin and Princess Amidala looks forced after the events of earlier film and because the age gap. If not for the special effects and story continuity, I would recommend to skip this one."
"Jun 30, 2012",5,"The film has its embarrassing moments, but what's good in it is really excellent. One of my favorite all-time movies."
"Jun 30, 2012",4.5,Good but too much of a love story
"Jun 30, 2012",5,Another great addition to the Star Wars saga.
"Jun 30, 2012",2.5,Lucas needs to go to writing class or simply let someone else write his material. Some of the best lines for the from a New Hope (that Lucas also wrote) were written by a someone other than the plaided one. This movie seemed to be just filler until they could get to the good stuff in ROTS.
"Jun 30, 2012",3,"I own this on Blu-Ray in a six movie pack along with:
* Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)
* Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith (2005)
* Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)
* Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)
* Star Wars Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi (1983)

and on DVD in a three movie pack along with:
* Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)
* Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith (2005)

and i also own the two-disc DVD."
"Jun 29, 2012",3,"Though bounds better than The Phantom Menace, whatever originality that Attack of the Clones was attempting was shot down by Hayden Christensen's mediocre acting."
"Jun 29, 2012",1,"The worst. There was no good acting, no emotion, it didn't have any feeling to it. You can quite literally hear the dollar signs racking up with every wasted explosion and useless CGI element.

I think what George Lucas attempted to do was force a Romeo and Juliet romance, probably the greatest romatic tragedy ever made, into this movie franchise and failed outright. But no matter how many good looking actors you throw into the film, it just won't cover two hours of emotionless dribble.

The only good part was the Fett; probably the only good aspect about the movie."
"Jun 29, 2012",4.5,"Awesome in its scope, but somehow it misses the mark."
"Jun 28, 2012",0.5,possibly the worst movie ever made
"Jun 28, 2012",5,i really love the movie
"Jun 28, 2012",2.5,"Hayden Christensen can't act his way out of a paper bag in the lighter, romantic scenes, but somehow finds his way in the second half as brooding Anakin Skywalker.  In fact, no one is particularly on top of their game in the early going, as if they are trying to figure out how to act against a back drop of special effects.  The film whips between different storylines with all the grace of a lightsaber cutting through butter.  That is to say, scenes are intercut with one another seemingly to remind the audience something else is going on in the movie.  The end battle feels too perfunctory and the effects look positively old school.  But it is a further adventure in this universe and the imagination of the creature designers is on full display.  That is good enough for a couple hours of entertainment."
"Jun 27, 2012",4.5,"For those wondering why I like this movie so much, it is just more fun. It has more a Star Wars feel than the first. We get the introduction to Count Dooku,, who is really cool, played great by Christopher Lee and it expands the universe more. The whole clones thing is something I really liked and had some really good social commentary with it. My only real flaws is that some of the aliens look too fake for me and some acting is god awful. Otherwise I consider it underrated."
"Jun 27, 2012",4,"This movie is exhilarating and very exciting. It builds on Episode I very well and shows the darker side of Anakin as he grows up and his journey towards the dark side of the force begins. Some parts of this were not hugely fast-paced - the romance scenes tend to drag on a bit. However, overall, a brilliant film and a great backdrop to the events of Episode III."
"Jun 25, 2012",3,"An intriguing story...that has been underutilized. Again, the special effects is the center piece of this Star Wars installment. Looking back, there are plot gaps that should've been addressed rather than shunned aside. However, Again, I find myself enjoying the movie visually than storywise. Teenage Anakin is too easily tempered, and has no malice equivalent to his future self Darth Vader. Again, story should've been handled better, but at least there is a good number of stuff to enjoy."
"Jun 25, 2012",3.5,"Although the second prequel is still not as great as it should be, it greatly makes up for the loss of form and fun in 'The Phantom Menace'."
"Jun 25, 2012",1.5,"Except for the very end, this is a horrible horrible movie."
"Jun 25, 2012",1.5,"Even though Jar-Jar Binks has been left out of this one, AOTC is the worst of the series."
"Jun 24, 2012",1,"Go watch the Red Letter Media reviews and ignore the critics. This is much worse than the phantom menace, not a step up."
"Jun 24, 2012",2.5,"The special effects and impressive action sequences keep this movie entertaining, but the poor writing and choppy plot still make it a below average film."
"Jun 23, 2012",1.5,Palpatine's behind it all!
"Jun 23, 2012",4,A fairly decent end to the first trilogy. Still better than ROTJ.
"Jun 22, 2012",0.5,"I thought it was impossible to be worst than Episode I, until I watched this movie. Oh dear, just a disaster. George Lucas, why?"
"Jun 22, 2012",0.5,"The worst out of the trilogy and the worst movie of all time. The film is all over the map with it's action, romance, syfy, and visual effects. I don't know what part of the film is suppose to be prominent... Peal Harbor did the same thing but better... and I HATE Pearl Harbor."
"Jun 21, 2012",3,"Movie was created to create Darth Vader. Sort of dull writing but Action was awesome and really showed the Jedi and what they are.
However, definitely the most weak of the saga"
"Jun 21, 2012",3,It's not the best but hey.. it is a star wars. I the more I watch it the more I like it.
"Jun 21, 2012",3.5,A much better and more enjoyable film than the previous but this one in the series seems to lack what I call a good plot.
"Jun 20, 2012",5,The greatest love story of all time.  Eat this Titanic!
"Jun 20, 2012",3.5,"Better than ""Episode I"" by a healthy margin, but still far away from the quality of the original trilogy. The movie really comes alive at about the 2 hour mark, when the epic arena battle begins. The film before that largely succeeds when focusing on Obi-Wan's attempts to solve the mystery of the clones on Kimino, and falls flat on its face when focusing on the budding romance of Amidala and Anakin. 

The classic Yoda lightsaber duel at the end is what gave this film lots of buzz when it came out, and it's still fun to watch. Like all the other movies, ""Clones"" is a triumph of visual effects, music, and sound- making it a far richer experience on the big screen. Well-deserved Oscar nomination for Visual Effects."
"Jun 20, 2012",0.5,This Movie Doesn't Exist!
"Jun 18, 2012",3.5,Uggg...why haven't they killed of Jar Jar YET
"Jun 18, 2012",4.5,"great movie, love how it gets into how anakin is not as good of a jedi as he should be. great action. and a good love story."
"Jun 17, 2012",0.5,A disgrace to Star Wars
"Jun 17, 2012",1,"This is a boring, Boring, BORING-movie. I recall saying movies are a form of art that's meant to entertain, so if there's no amusement found from it, that's my definition of a bad movie; and this is a 1 BAD movie. The 1 star is only for John Willaims' score, anything else doesn't save this picture. If your going to have a Star Wars marathon, I reccomend skipping this product."
"Jun 17, 2012",3.5,Fantasy and an escape movie means be careful to have a good conversation while watching this movie
"Jun 17, 2012",1,"George, if you're going to have a love story, use better dialogue. 
Anakin: If you are suffering as much as I am, please tell me. 
Padme: I can't... We can't... It's not possible. 
Anakin: Anything is possible, Padme, listen to me. 
Padme: No you listen! We live in a real world, come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi, I'm... I'm a senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, it will take us to a place we cannot go, regardless of the way we feel about each other. 
Anakin: Then you do feel something! 
Padme: I will not let you give up your future for me. 
Anakin: You're asking me to be rational. That is something that I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish I could just wish away my feelings, but I can't."
"Jun 16, 2012",0.5,"Possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Lucas does not understand women and holds on to Shakespearean ideals. Why would Padme love him again? It's like watching a poorly made video game.

"Jun 15, 2012",4.5,"Loy Machedo's Movie Review - Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones.On a backdrop of a silly love story that had to move unavoidably in the direction it moved, the movie has its share of amazing moments that will leave you spell bound. Just when you thought that George Lucas achieved the maximum of what he could do, he upped the ante much more. If you want to know how much effort has gone into the making of this movie - Have a look at its making (courtesy DVD Bonus) and you will be amazed. Impressive and a Must Watch for all Die Hard fans of Star Wars.

"Jun 15, 2012",1.5,"The worst of the bunch. At least Phantom Menace had the decency to be fun, even if it's pointless."
"Jun 14, 2012",3.5,"This is not as bad as everyone claims, although it has a too much cgi and Anikan's annoying at times, I actually had fun with this. B"
"Jun 14, 2012",5,The best out of all of them!
"Jun 14, 2012",1,"Terrible acting from Hayden Christian, and just not very good. The battle at the end is the only thing worth watching in this film. yes, I actually liked Phantom Menace better."
"Jun 13, 2012",3,"Personally believe that Attack of the Clones is worse than Phantom Menace, although the action scenes are definitely awesome. Episode II's flaw is how you can't help but think that it was only made to bridge the huge gap between episodes I and III, thus the poorly written script with all flash and no substance."
"Jun 13, 2012",3.5,They only got slightly better each time...
"Jun 13, 2012",4,"This time around George Lucas keeps his poor lead, Natalie Portman, and when he has the chance to add a good actor, he chooses another bad one, Hayden Christensen, causing the rest of the supporting cast to struggle on making them look good. I don't think all of the romance scenes are as bad as people say. It is meant to be poetically written. With a cool new villain that actually talks and getting to see Master Yoda finally whip out a lightsaber, Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is an obvious improvement over The Phantom Menace."
"Jun 13, 2012",2,"I know I'm not the first to say something negative about these newer movies. And this one was head and shoulders above Episode 1. But this one still had quite a few flaws. Like the 30 minutes of chasing a bounty hunter who immediately dies when caught. It was as useful for the plot as the pod racing scene in ep 1. But the worst part, by far, was how whiney and obnoxious Anakin is throughout the entirety of the movie. We all saw Episode one and thought that Jake Lloyd set the bar pretty high for lack of likability, but boy were we wrong. Episode 2 Anakin almost seems to feed off bad choices and just being irritating. He is constantly trying to pull incredibly stupid stunts only to be talked out of it, then goes and complains about Obi Wan not thinking he is ready. He leaves Naboo against Jedi Council orders to go solve his dream mystery about his mom. He tries to get the clones to land the ship when Padme falls out onto a sand dune, even though she's clearly okay, and that would result in Dooku getting away and dozens of Jedi dying in vain. He freaking bull-rushes Count Dooku when Obi Wan is trying to be strategic about an outmatched fight. Yet somehow he charms Padme into marrying him even though he has absolutely no filter on what he says and is constantly whining, being creepy, and saying the corniest lines possible. Every single conversation they have is painful because of how socially retarded Anakin is. And Padme just takes it, even though she's freaking Natalie Portman and could do so much better. Actually- the writers could have done so much better by showing Anakin's eventual turn to the dark side without making him completely hatable the entire time he is on the screen. He is the main character in the movie, and arguably 3 movies. This whole trilogy is focused on his character, so naturally the audience should be able to connect with him, relate with him, or at the very least sympathize with him. Instead, he had the logic of a girl in a horror movie, and I can't help but not care about him because of how annoying he is. I want so badly to like Anakin. The idea of his character as outlined in the original trilogy had so much potential, but Lucas not only wasted that potential, but he wiped his butt with it. All of that being said, this movie is a necessary evil to make way for Episode 3, where Anakin actually improves a little and doesn't ruin the whole movie. Even saying it is necessary is a little difficult for me since the option is present to just read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia. With that, I imagine one would not have to deal with the nauseating puns, the painful conversations, and the dated CGI (or actually having to wait for Anakin to get off the screen). It's 2 and a half hours of backstory that is undoubtedly interesting, but very painful."
"Jun 13, 2012",3,better than the first
"Jun 13, 2012",2,"The Star Wars prequels feel so...empty and void of character.   Much like the romance between Anakin and Padme.   George Lucas had dubbed this segment as the Romantic segment of Star Wars.  Even for science fiction, it's out there.  You really don't feel a connection between the characters.  Hayden Christansen is just...hard to watch.  He's a bad actor, there is no way to sugar coat it.  Ewan McGreggor is phenomenal as Obi-Wan Kenobi, as always.   Each time the film cuts away from him and goes back to the forced romance between Anakin and Padme, the film drags.  And becomes totally cheesy.  I had low expectations when seeing this film after the disappointment of Episode One, and I still felt let down.  Sure, there are some great moments.  The last twenty minutes we get to see the start of the Clone Wars.  And that is a lot of fun.  But Count Dooku is NO Darth Maul, and Anakin is no Luke Skywalker.  The Yoda fight scene was neat.  All two minutes of it.  Again, I am disappointed and find it difficult to recommend this film."
"Jun 11, 2012",5,"This was a good one too, but probably my least favorite. Don't get my wrong  I still love the movie but it's the last one I would pick to watch out of all 6. I wasn't fond of Hayden Christensen in this one. Above all it is an awesome movie and I can't wait ot see it in 3D."
"Jun 10, 2012",3,A Good Star Wars film but the love story aspect of the film keeps it from being a great film.
"Jun 09, 2012",1.5,"An argument against prequels, CGI, and letting George Lucas off the Skywalker Ranch."
"Jun 09, 2012",3,"NOT AS GOOD AS ORIGINALS, BUT GOOD"
"Jun 08, 2012",0.5,I can't bear to watch
"Jun 08, 2012",3,"This is the worst movie of the 6. The dialogue is atrocious and the acting speaks for itself. The action, of course, is fresh and crisp. There are many visuals to be appreciated. The story carries slowly but it progresses the inevitable fate of young Skywalker."
"Jun 07, 2012",4,Good film in the Star Wars series.  Great effects and better story than Phantom Meance.
"Jun 05, 2012",1,"well.....it had.....um....
Samuel L. Jackson kicking ass, but the rest sucked."
"Jun 04, 2012",5,"More Suspensefu than Phantom Menace, but the Romance is a little dry."
"Jun 04, 2012",2.5,not much better than phantom menace as the script is a bit iffy but it is a little bit better... :/ xx
"Jun 04, 2012",3.5,Star Wars has improved compared to Phantom of Menace but was more romantic than action besides the last couple of scenes. Good film but not great
"Jun 03, 2012",4,You knew it was coming but it was still sad when Anakin turned into Darth Vadar and Padme died!
"Jun 02, 2012",5,Excellent special effects and action sequences.
"Jun 02, 2012",5,Star Wars is a masterpeice!
"Jun 01, 2012",2,This film makes me angry.
"May 31, 2012",3,"It is a little better than Episode I, but that isn't saying a whole lot.  It's also a good example of how NOT to make a love story, especially when the guy is a whiny idiot."
"May 30, 2012",3.5,Another good Star Wars movie.
"May 30, 2012",1,"excluding Christopher Lee who eats up the role of Darth Tyrannus, everyone gives either a plain awful or disinterested performance. the writing is horrible and the effects some of the worst CGI I've ever seen in a movie. they even managed to screw up the lightsaber fight. while the arena scene is cool and so is when the clones attack, and when anakin finds his mother and the scene following it,but 20 minutes of cool don't make up for the other 2hrs 4min of boredom. by. far the worst Star Wars film and one of the worst films I've ever seen yes its that bad."
"May 30, 2012",5,The Best Star Wars i dont care what Jordan says this one is better!
"May 29, 2012",3,Redeemed only by asteroid chase and yoda...
"May 28, 2012",4,its ok. again a movie for fans
"May 28, 2012",5,I grew up watching star wars . I love it!
"May 28, 2012",0.5,"Easily the worst Star Wars movie....yes, worse than Clone Wars"
"May 28, 2012",1,The worst Star Wars film
"May 26, 2012",2.5,The feel-good comedy of the year!
"May 25, 2012",0.5,"As with all of the second run of Starwars, this film is crap. The only good thing is the fight scene at the end"
"May 25, 2012",2.5,"Episode 2 stepped it up as far as action, pace, and special effects go, but that's pretty much where the praises end when it comes to this one. For me the ultimate low point was the acting during any point of the ""Love Story"". I don't know if it was the bad acting or just a really bad script, but one thing is for sure. This movie will no doubt, forever be a shit stain on the career of Natalie Portman. Even more so than when she did a film staring Ashton Kutcher!"
"May 25, 2012",1.5,Much better then episode 1 but the chemistry between the cast is not there.
"May 25, 2012",2.5,Hayden ruins this one
"May 24, 2012",5,"its not perfect and there are problems with the entire prequel trilogy, but it has some way romanticized the series for children in ways not many other movies could. plus Jar Jar wasn't in it as much!"
"May 24, 2012",0.5,"Worse than Episode I, if that's possible.  It's like watching a junior high play with lightsabers and blue screens."
"May 24, 2012",4.5,yeah yoda kicking ass
"May 23, 2012",5,"some things i like from episode II:the chaser scene is pretty fun,the movie have nice references to the originals,the colloseum scene is awesome,Jango Fett is awesome so are the battles he got,the asteroid chase is great with very cool slow motion effects, the romance was nice and fitting for the setting of the movie,Yoda lightsaber skills are awesome,Dooku was a great villain,Anakin searching for his mother and the scene where he finds her are great,theres is so much more shown for the very cool planet Coruscant than in EP I. Great ending scenes that show very well whats to come for the end of the beginning."
"May 22, 2012",2.5,"Mejor que la amenaza fantasma, mejor accion, mejor trama. Aqui hay un antagonista de verdad (Dooku). De todas formas se nota como el marketing se la gano a George Lucas. La pelicula es una maquina de inventar juguetes, como que se preocupa mas de generar merchandising que de hacer una pelicula memorable. La trama romantica es digna de una mala teleserie, pesimos dialogos. Insoportable por momentos. Mal Christensen, muy poca expresion facial. Aunque no se si es mal actor o es Lucas el que hace actuar mal (Portman, McGregor, buenos actores que actuaron mal con Lucas). Es destacable y muy decidor que Christensen ese año gano la frambuesa de oro al peor actor."
"May 21, 2012",1,"without a doubt, this is the worst of the Star Wars films and it deserves to be on the list of worst films ever made. Wooden acting meets horrific dialogue meets lame special effects meets awful, awful storytelling. This movie cemented the prequels as garbage and dug the saga's grave even deeper."
"May 21, 2012",4,"The end battle is nothing short of amazing, what given the beyond state of the art special effects and all. Mr. Lucas made a mistake making these prequels alright, made the them good enough that they dont need remade ever again."
"May 21, 2012",2,Lucas doesn't deserve your money.
"May 20, 2012",4.5,The clone wars is probably the 2nd best movie of the 1st three episodes.
"May 20, 2012",4.5,"Can somebody take down Anakin Skywalker hornyness in this movie? But common, Yoda kicked some real ass in this one!"
"May 20, 2012",2,Ehh.  I'm trying to remember if it had any moments...
"May 18, 2012",3,"While the effects are stunning and the score is memorable, the terrible dialogue and lackluster acting really hurt this film - this is most likely the fault of the director and writers. However, it does still boast some impressive duels and powerful scenes amidst the mess of messy dialogue and weird story, which just barely saves it from being the worst entry in the series."
"May 18, 2012",4,Hayden Christensen fue lo Ãºnico que no me convenciÃ³ nunca ni en este episodio ni en el III.
"May 17, 2012",4,Killer special effects
"May 15, 2012",2.5,"Some good acting, fun action, effects, and costume designs. This movie is flawed by its stupid love story and overuse of CGI."
"May 13, 2012",1,"The first wasn't a fluke. In fact, this second entry is even sloppier and boring than the first."
"May 13, 2012",2,"Other than the special effects, this movie is really boring and dreadful to watch."
"May 12, 2012",5,This movie was so great! A perfect sequel to the Phantom Menace. I am a big Star Wars fan and this movie was great with awesome new characters such as Jango Fett! 3 out of 5 stars! Excellent movie!
"May 12, 2012",3,Enjoyable but probably the worst out of the whole saga. CGI fighting Yoda was not for me!
"May 12, 2012",2,"Christopher Lee and Natalie Portman ...Jango Fett and Mace Windu......otherwise,don't bother."
"May 12, 2012",2.5,"All the fantastic FX and action sequences you want to throw at an audience can only accomplish so much when your film's story revolves around the relationship between two characters. In 'Attack of the Clones', it's a budding romance between Hayden Christensen's Anakin and Natalie Portman's Padmé, and pretty much every aspect of it falls flat. As stilted as young Jake Lloyd was in 'The Phantom Menace', Christensen is almost more cringe-worthy playing Anakin here; he seems to vacillate between petulance and an odd creepiness. Portman tries, but she has zero chemistry with her leading man, and their dialog by George Lucas is often laughably bad. To make matters worse, the film's last third relies on so much CGI, it feels like watching a videogame play out. Sure, it gets a few laughs, but I didn't need to see a lightsaber battle with Yoda spinning around like a green top. Some scenes feel like Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi is holding things together from becoming pure silliness through force of will -- he remains a consistent bright spot here. 'Attack of the Clones' still has enough spectacle to make it worth a watch, but only just barely."
"May 12, 2012",5,"I love this movie! It is one of my favorite movies of all time! I am a Star Wars freak so it is obvious that I would love the movie. This Star Wars has the biggest love story of them all. This movie is extrordinary! It almost looks real compared to other movies like this! considering how old this is, it looks real! It is a must see!"
"May 12, 2012",4.5,Another great episode. Fantastic.
"May 11, 2012",3,"Despite the terrible scenes between Anakin and Padme, I thought this film was entertaining and really did keep the story moving.  It really did introduce a lot of the conflict and the idea of the clone wars.  I also enjoyed Jengo Fett."
"May 10, 2012",2,Worst Star Wars film I ever watched. Everything is just forgettable other than Anakin's mother death.
"May 09, 2012",3.5,"Mostly for action.  The discovery of the Clone army was interesting in more than one way, also."
"May 08, 2012",3.5,"The Next Star Wars movie is Attack of the Clones. This is where Anakin Skywalker has became a apprentice to Obi Wan and is forced not to love. There is a memorable scene were there is a stadium battle between monsters and our three protaginists. They don't use a puppet for Yoda. Instead they use CGI technology from Industrial Light and Magic. This is used because how can you make a puppet not puppet fight? This is a good one,

79/100 B"
"May 07, 2012",0.5,The Sarlacc Pit is a thousand years of being digested. That is better than this
"May 07, 2012",2,"This movie really is bad. Someone has to explain to me when Anakin became Padme's age. I missed that somehow i guess. The movie is poorly put together, the story is not interesting, the acting is poor, and the directing and editing is worse then all that. I really cannot express how disappointing this movie is. Not a film I would even watch if it was on TV."
"May 06, 2012",3,Certainly it was better than the Phantom Menace. The main characters started to get developed in this one. It has a lot of more action.
"May 06, 2012",2,"George, what did you do? What did you do?"
"May 06, 2012",3.5,Better than Episode I but its still lacking a lot of the original trilogy's charm.  The arena battles at the end of the film are epic and worth staying for.
"May 05, 2012",1,"Terrible everything.  ""But what about the special effects?""  I don't care about the special effects!  I care about three little idsy bitsy unimportant things in a movie.  Plot, dialogue, and acting!"
"May 04, 2012",1,"Cold passionless CGI set pieces and absolutely terrible dialogue translates into cardboard acting and characters you can't relate to. Major relationships and plot points are explained to us instead of shown and developed throughout the story. If it wasn't for the excessive use of CGI, one would wonder if this would have been better to have been a radio show (the shitty dialogue quickly answers this question). Even some one with as little experience as me noticed the utter use to death of over shoulder camera angle; just boring to watch even with all the perdy CGI. To conclude, Lucas is a hack."
"May 04, 2012",3.5,It was pretty good there were a couple scenes I liked the best.
"May 04, 2012",2,"Pour la scène dans l'arène, la planète des clones et Jango Fett."
"May 03, 2012",1,The chemistry in this is about as bad as anything I've ever seen.  The only save is the few good action scenes.
"May 03, 2012",3.5,"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, is a big improvement from its predacessor The Phantom Menace.  It has a great story plus all of the action that Star Wars fans have been wanting for so many years.  With advances in CGI, we can now witness extrodinary battles and lightsaber fights that were impossible in the original.  But what I feel is so good about this film, is that it opens up a new universe for the series.  With the Attack of the Clones it gives fans of the series a whole new universe to explore on the big screen, and in the comics.  Attack of the Clones is very entertaining and should be acceptable for fans and new viewers of the franchise."
"May 03, 2012",3,"Easily an improvement on the sci-fi turd that came before, Episode II delivers the same action thrills as the originals, but still falls flat in making up most of the characters. The love story between Anakin and Padme will leave viewers drowning in roadkill-cliche sentementality. But all is saved in Yoda's spotlight moment."
"May 03, 2012",2.5,"Better than the Episode 1, but still not good."
"May 02, 2012",2.5,it s sad and really long!
"May 01, 2012",2,"Boring, badly written and cliché. Definately the worst Star Wars film."
"Apr 30, 2012",3,Horrible acting. Good to see they kept the action alive for the most part. I didn't realize how unnatural some of the character development was when I was younger.
"Apr 30, 2012",1.5,"I was impressed with this movie when I was 10.  My hopes were high when I went to re-watch Attack of the Clones, but alas, I was quite disappointed.  The script undoubtedly appealed to me when I was ten because it sounded as though it were written by a ten-year-old.  While Ewan McGregor is always wonderful, this is probably Natalie Portman's worst movie, and Hayden Christensen should never be allowed to act in a romantic role ever again.  There are a few cool fight scenes, but I couldn't get past the abominable acting and juvenile script.  Don't bother watching this movie unless you're having a Star Wars Marathon.  And even then, be prepared to read a book or something whenever they aren't fighting."
"Apr 30, 2012",0.5,"What do you get when you mix an anemic, painfully bad Romance with an insultingly stupid, Kindergarden-level Conspiracy/Mystery plot? The single worst thing to happen to fans of cinema since George Lucas's last blight upon humanity. ""Attack of the Clones"" is the second punch in the nose to fans and casual filmgoers alike, compounding all the previous picture's faults with brand new ones. A soulless, forced love-story, a brain-damaged detective film, and an unexplained, lifeless war picture, ""Episode II"" fails at everything it attempts, ruining the Jedi, Yoda, and the world at large, simply by existing."
"Apr 30, 2012",3.5,"B-

The weakest movie in the series by far. Slow and Boring but when it finally does pick up it makes up for everything else."
"Apr 29, 2012",4,Yoda and Sam Jackson kick ass and almost make me forget about the crappy love story
"Apr 29, 2012",3,"Better than the first, but still not good."
"Apr 28, 2012",2.5,You know that they had to make it.  It could have used more feeling but it didn't lack imagination for my mind.
"Apr 28, 2012",3.5,Not as good as the originals but still a movie you wanna see
"Apr 28, 2012",5,Lucas recaptured and accentuated the elements that made the original films such a joy to experience.

"Apr 27, 2012",4,89% satisfied..just intense mood..
"Apr 26, 2012",2,Don't talk to me about the new Star Wars films.  It won't end well.
"Apr 26, 2012",4,While the love story and politics weren't the most exciting screen time for a SW film the Anakin/Vader plot was dark enough to keep my attention.

"Apr 23, 2012",1,Disappointing on many levels.
"Apr 23, 2012",2.5,"Whats happened to Star Wars? Despite it having moments of glory (the space fights, etc) this feels like a overlong soap opera."
"Apr 22, 2012",3.5,If this hadn't had Hayden Christensen and the overdone love story it would have been such a better film. I remember a rumor at the time that Leonardo DiCaprio would play Anikan and looking back I think that would have been a much better choice. The all Jedi army fight scenes at the end were amazing. I geeked out the first time I saw all of those light sabers light up around the colloseum.
"Apr 22, 2012",2,Suffers from the very poor acting of Hayden Christensen. Nothing special. 2/5
"Apr 22, 2012",5,definatly better then the first one it had more action and we got to see the transformation from anakin to darth vader and the effects were really well done and the acting was great on hayden christensens part so it wasnt a let down in the series at all

Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Review
There is unrest in the minds of Star Wars fans. The Phantom Menace just kept its head above water, worth sitting through at least once or every-now-and-then. The next chronological installment/second prequel does just that too, with less Jar-Jar (Ahmed Best). We open with the opening crawl (obviously) and then tilt up instead of down to Coruscant, where Naboo's Senator arrives, before an explosion takes her life. Wait, that was a decoy, and real Senator/Former Queen Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) reveals herself to be among the pilots (wow, those Nabooians are so cautious with their leaders, and maybe a little paranoid). What follows is a series of people talking in circles (which repeats itself throughout and brings space adventures and mysteries to a screeching halt), and then things heat up when Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) arrive to guard Senator Amidala after their only run-in with Jar-Jar, who's been reduced in role for this movie, but expanded in role for the larger Star Wars Universe. When a bounty hunter tries killing Padme, Obi-Wan and Anakin get into a high-octane speeder chase that ends with the beginning of a conspiracy being pulled apart throughout. Instead of just focusing on this conspiracy, we get Anakin doing more Padme guarding injected in, followed by their bad romance, which can be explained simply: they've been repressing their emotions in the decade between I and II for the good of the Jedi Order and their political system. Maybe it was the force keeping balance, but I'm gonna admit this love story gets cringe worthy, but whatever you feel about it, this is Lucas' vision. Sorry to say his vision also had a mix of great and horrendous CGI. The good news: Coruscant and Kamino were brilliant looking and the massive CGI battles (while lacking a human link to humanize it) didn't blow you away, even if it was a little too big. The bad news is that several green-screens are so obviously fake. The ones used for windows showing Coruscant's skyline worked well, but when you see Anakin riding his speeder down the Tatooine dunes or Dooku doing the same thing in the Geonosis dunes. The CGI characters aren't horrendous, just a little odd (this technology was in its infancy at the time) but well detailed. And they advance the plot in some form or another. All of this is set to John Williams' great soundtrack, that never fails to disappoint. His main theme music ""Across the Stars"" really captures the romantic tension George Lucas fails to sell if you don't think about how emotionally repressed the two are. Their dialogue isn't great, but the bad dialogue can actually have some good meaning: Anakin's ""sand monologue,"" as I call it, is actually a reasonable thing for him to say, because he grew up on a desert planet, in the sand! Just like eskimos would have more words for snow than we do, he would have more knowledge and descriptiveness for sand. It feels redundant, but it's something he knows, and it's what he can use as a parallel to Padme in his twisted world of joining the Jedi Order too late. Overall, Attack of the Clones is not the attack on cinema people make it out to be, but I can understand why: mixed-result CGI and never-ending political debates bringing the pace to a screeching halt to the space adventure. I know this is just opinion, but I like (not love) Attack of the Clones for its coherent story, decent (but forgivably flawed) character development, everything there for the sake of telling how the war Anakin Skywalker would fight in and eventually lead to the Original Trilogy, a John Williams soundtrack that does its job in the movie and is worth listening to outside of it, and dialogue that makes sense to George Lucas and the Star Wars Universe, but not to most other people. Thanks, and may the force be with you.

Coming off the heels of The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones proves to be my least favorite Star Wars. While the CGI imagery improved, the story proves to drag on and on with things like flying through Coruscant being one of only few exciting scenes. Hayden Christianson takes on the role of an Anakin 10 years older than Jake Lloyd's. While girls and women may like his looks, no one will like his acting. And they say Natalie Portman sounded like a robot in The Phantom Menace. She was speaking in a royal tone to sound dignified, and allow Kiera Knightly as her royal body double to go unnoticed. This is unexcusable. This is why I prefer Matt Lanter's Clone Wars voice. Confident, bold, neither of these are present in Hayden Christianson. Ewan McGregor starts to look more like the Obi-Wan my parents knew before George Lucas and Steven Spielburg snapped. The plot may not be desirable to retro fans, but here's the thing: Jedi worked for Republic, they strayed from light, that's what this is about. Sorry it's so political, but we should just accept that's how the Jedi Order fell. Finally, the dialogue was pretty stale. Mostly. Some lines actually stuck in my mind. If I listed them, I'd spoil the movie. If you like chronological order like me, or enjoy a solid John Williams Soundtrack, or just like quality abuse of CGI, I'd reccomend this movie. But not if you hate abuse of CGI, if you hate dull actors (Sorry Hayden, but you should have used a little more emotion) or just wish to forget this one. Until next time, may the force be with JJ Abrams for Episode VII.

Star Wars Episode II may be the least popular Star Wars film of all six.  True, there is not a single original piece of dialouge, but everything else makes up for it.  For example, the characters were verly likeable.  I personally am a big fan of CGI creatures, since they can do more than puppets/muppets, which is why I absolutly love seeing the CGI Yoda whip out his lightsaber, and fight Dooku with it.  Also, there was excellent quality of the images, but there was a shot or two where greenscreens were obvious.  Finally, I just love a John Williams score.  Doesn't evrybody?  Bottom line, Star Wars Episode II is the least popular movie in the saga, but it's Star Wars, so we can forgive a let down."
"Apr 20, 2012",2,"George Lucas, you disappoint me!"
"Apr 19, 2012",5,"Jedi business, return to your drinks."
"Apr 18, 2012",3.5,"When you watch the film, you can spot that Anakin's dark side of the Force begins to show."
"Apr 18, 2012",3,better than Episode 1
"Apr 17, 2012",5,love star wars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Apr 17, 2012",3.5,great action;plus Yoda kicks sith ass
"Apr 17, 2012",1.5,"And the annoyance continues. As I said in my Episode 1 review I wanted to like this film, in fact I wanted to like it so much that I thought I did after the first time I saw it. Yet each time I've watched it after that first time I find my opinion gradually worsening. A huge part of this is the ridiculously complex plot that makes no sense. I'm still struggling to see how no one could speak up and tell Lucas that this whole convoluted tale is nonsense. Anyone ever heard of the KISS method...keep it simple, stupid! Yet they try to weave a love story and a mystery into one, and fail at both.

Hayden Christensen continues in Jake Lloyd's footsteps by making Anakin virtually unwatchable. Of course it's extraordinarily unfair to judge anyone's acting skills with this horrid dialogue. Everything is so wooden and scripted. Has Lucas ever heard real people talk, because this isn't how it goes. Yet you have to sit through hours of exposition. And that's the biggest crime of this film, we hardly ever get to see things actually happen, particularly when it comes to emotions. People tell us they are friends, or tell us they are in love but we never believe it because we never see it happen.

Now the one decent aspect of this film is that the action sequences are visually exciting. It really is cool to see the lightsaber duels and the war scenes. However even this cool-looking stuff is ruined because they remove any tension. It's bad enough that (as prequels) we know certain characters will survive, but then they turn the Jedi into super heroes with abilities that would put Superman to shame. They seem capable of falling 15 stories onto a speeding vehicle without injury, spotting an enemy out of a crowd of millions, even reading minds. With this much unbridled power how can we even fear for their safety, in fact the only thing that seems capable of injuring them is other Jedi. I think I could keep going, but I'll stop here. This movie is bad...'nuff said."
"Apr 17, 2012",4,"Great special effects, but that's about it"
"Apr 17, 2012",3.5,Nice transition piece. It was ok
"Apr 16, 2012",3.5,IT WAS OK BUT IT WAS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS STAR WARS MOVIES. I LIKE THE BATTLER OF ALL JEDIES IN THE ARENA AND YODA VS COUNT DOKU. THE STORY IS OK.
"Apr 16, 2012",2.5,Not a very good star wars film.
"Apr 16, 2012",4.5,Star wars  need I say more?
"Apr 16, 2012",2.5,"Oh dear heaven...George Lucas obviously tried to be tragic and romantic, but it didn't work. The whole thing is corny. There isn't enough exciting action to make up for it either...except for the last half hour, which is epic. Every Jedi vs. an army of droids, and the Count Dooku battle...those were awesome. The rest is seriously awful. But because of the last half hour, I guess I can't hate it."

"Apr 11, 2012",5,Wish it was called The Clone Wars...much better name.
"Apr 11, 2012",4,Four stars only for the fact that Yoda has his first ever fight scene in the series
"Apr 11, 2012",3,"good, but really bad acting"
"Apr 10, 2012",3,I like the old ones better
"Apr 10, 2012",2,"Just about every part of this movie doesn't work. I gave Phantom Menace a slight pass because it was at least visually stunning.  While Attack of the Clones has its moments, it contains some of the worst-integrated CGI I've ever seen from a mega-budget production.   
The action scenes in this film are completely cartoonish and unrealistic, the romance is hokey and not believable, and the last half of the movie is one consequence-free battle after the next (save for the fight with Count Dookoo, which is probably my favorite part of the film).  
We follow Obi-Wan for much of the movie trying to uncover a mystery of who is trying to assassinate Padme.  It's mostly boring. We follow Anakin and Padme as they fall in love and discover something tragic to do with Anakin's mother. It's mostly boring. 
Despite having the exact same problems as Phantom Menace, for some reason I just can't stand this one.  It does it's bare minimum job of building up tension for the next film, and offers a few good (and bad) action scenes.  Just about everything else fails horribly. And can someone please explain why this film was called ""Attack of the Clones?"" Was there no alternative title? Lame."
"Apr 09, 2012",4.5,"I really liked the cloning aliens, so majestic, another hit George!"
"Apr 09, 2012",4,"Why, oh why, they make a movie just with Hayden Christensen, just so we can stare at his abs????"
"Apr 09, 2012",2.5,This is the second worst Star Wars movie. it's okay i guess.
"Apr 09, 2012",3.5,Jedi's Kicking Ass Nuff Said!!!
"Apr 09, 2012",2.5,Slightly better than Phantom Menace but   it's just a forgettable and a moslty lame movie.
"Apr 08, 2012",3.5,"As much as I hate the choice in Hayden Christensen as Anakin, this wasn't too bad. A little too romantic for Star Wars, but at least we know it actually leads somewhere."
"Apr 08, 2012",3.5,"Better than Episode 1, but really, did you have to get Hayden Christensen? Could have done better, George."
"Apr 08, 2012",5,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! love starwars!
"Apr 08, 2012",2,"Great actors, terrible acting, terrible plot, special effects for the sake of special effects.  Lucas shouldn't have directed this travesty of the Star Wars Saga. The animated clone wars was far more interesting"

"Apr 07, 2012",0.5,"almost impossible to watch for the dialogue and the corny acting and the teeeerrible, contrived love angle."
"Apr 07, 2012",3,Better then Phantom of Menace but nowhere near the Original Trilogy.
"Apr 07, 2012",0.5,"If you thought the Phantom Menace was bad, it gets worse! Hayden Christensen is awful and whiny, the romance is vomit inducing, the plot is boring, the characters are paper thin, the dialogue is forced. Need I say more?"

"Apr 06, 2012",4.5,"better than episode 1 this movie delivers the imagination of star wars to life with aliens with long necks to a cool fight scene at the end on geonosis. this wasn't the best of star wars but it is fun at certan points and keeps up the pace in the action. The thing that falls apart for the movie is the romance bettween Anakin and Padma. while i don't mind it and it keeps the story going sometimes the dialouge seems like it was taken out of Romeo and Juliet, well maybe that was the idea but personally i didn't mind but it also kind of slowed the movie down alittle but on top of that i liked the whole solving the mystery building up to the clone wars and discovering a new planet from the star wars universe and getting sucked into the star wars galaxy"

"Apr 03, 2012",3,"The story is well written, but not executed well enough."
"Apr 03, 2012",1.5,"The worst live action film of the entire saga. Bad acting, writing, and effects."
"Apr 03, 2012",0.5,"I'm one of those ""Star Wars"" fans who thought the prequels were utter garbage. The dialogue is horrible, the characters are wooden, and the production favors special effects over story."
"Apr 03, 2012",3,Better than Phantom Menace.  Jango!  Yoda kicking ass!
"Apr 02, 2012",3,The action and drama is better than the first film.
"Apr 02, 2012",3,the worst out of the 6
"Apr 02, 2012",5,"I'm a big Sta Wars fan , anough said."
"Apr 02, 2012",2,Meh.  I'm not fond of Star Wars.
"Apr 01, 2012",3,the planet Kamino is my favorite but there were some serious problems with the last 3rd of the film.
"Apr 01, 2012",3.5,Okay addition to the series.
"Apr 01, 2012",3.5,"Attack of the Clones - An improvement but not by much. I know the movie focuse mainly on Anakin Skywalker but i would like to see character development in the other characters too. That is what differs the prequels from episode 4,5, and 6. I am still not liking the actor for Obi-Wan Kenobi. It does not seem like Obi-Wan would turn out to become that awesome guy he was in episode 4. Also the dialogue is extremely cheesy. Best thing in this film is the action sequences and visual effects."
"Apr 01, 2012",4,"A somewhat decent film, the second Star Wars chapter makes a good step towards the beginning of a new era that once was; the original Star Wars trilogy that everyone knows and loves, When the Republic was an Empire."
"Apr 01, 2012",4,"great story, nice special effects"
"Apr 01, 2012",3,"Anakin has grown up and still training to be a Jedi under Obiwan. Padme is now a Senator whose life is still at risk and across the galaxy things are in motion with the construction of a mysterious clone army for the Republic while the Separatists are building their own army and getting stronger.

Events bring our characters back together in Attack of the Clones and Anakin begins his woeful (to watch) attempts to court Padme - despite their age difference. He succeeds with his creepiness by the end of the film while Obiwan stumbles across the clone army on Camino.

Terrible acting, an implausible relationship that somehow forms, belittling from a teacher to his student and other things all make this film feel slow and had me concentrating on what was wrong with it - until the film's climax. I'll admit, show me enough special effects and I'll be satisfied. While a lot of the earlier CG scenes looked false, particularly in Palpatine's office on Coruscant, the battle sequences at the end of the film were really well done - I'm even a fan of the Yoda vs Count Dooku lightsabre duel.

In any case, this film was slightly better than Episode I, but painful compared to what is to come."
"Mar 31, 2012",2,"My least favorite of the prequels by far.  The awkward and hap-hazard (not to mention hokey) love story just drags this film into awfulness and boredom.  A great deal of time spent on useless story information and showing off special effects.  No one could have believe that the follow-up to The Phantom Menace could actually be worse.  I was dead wrong on that one.  On a positive note, I'll stick with the Attack of the Phantom version of this movie, which makes it much more accessible and watchable."
"Mar 31, 2012",2.5,"My least favorite Star Wars film. Yes, I actually enjoy The Phantom Menace more."
"Mar 31, 2012",3.5,"Even though this second installement is a step up from the phantom menace, Attack of the clones never reaches the heights of the original trilogy thanks to Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader's lack of chemistry with love interest Natalie Portman, but the action is superb, and Ewan McGregor is the best part of the prequels."
"Mar 30, 2012",2,"After the Jar Jar Binks debacle of Episode I, George Lucas provided us with another one: Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker.  He turns into Darth Vader?  Really?  This whining, mewling teenager becomes the evil, Lord Vader?  Wake me up when it's over..."
"Mar 29, 2012",3.5,found script a bit cheezy
"Mar 27, 2012",3.5,"Much better than episode I. The love story, while necessary, was poorly executed and clumsy. The ending clearly makes up for all of that though."
"Mar 26, 2012",2,If whining and rolling in the grass made a good movie this would rock! CGI on crack and more terrible dialogue.
"Mar 25, 2012",3.5,Focused too much on brilliant special effects the story starts getting predictable. At least Count Dooku is a better villain than Darth Maul.
"Mar 25, 2012",3,"Could have had a better title, but seeing Yoda finally fight made it worth it"
"Mar 24, 2012",4,All of Star Wars are great!
"Mar 24, 2012",3.5,"Better than Episode 1, but still not the battle that  I was waiting for."
"Mar 23, 2012",2,"Better than the first, but still not very good"
"Mar 23, 2012",2.5,"Ok, let's make the same movie, call it something else, and get paid lots of money.  Episode II: Attack of the Clones (aka Empire Strikes Back II).  Here are the similarities that I have found (Epi II will come first then Epi V):  Yoda shows off fighting/Yoda shows off using the force, first time we see Jango (and supposedly Boba)/first time we see Boba, look an all water planet called camino/look an all snow(water) planet called hoth, can we have a chase through an asteroid field, First AT-TE/First AT-AT, Wow Anakin looses a hand/so does luke, Big shocker - Ani's mom dies/Big shocker - Vader is daddy dearest, Schmi gets captured/Han gets captured, Jango's head rolls/Vader's head rolls, 3po gets taken apart/3po gets taken apart.  Movies saving grace: droids vs Jedi, and Yoda's fight scene.  Oh yeah, if the death of his mom was so tragic, why did it take him so long to see her again.  So, it's ok for her to be enslaved to Watto for the rest of her life, but heaven forbid she be taken by a tuskan raider and abused to the point of death.  Little Raiders have mommys too.  Hypocrit!  So much for his promise to come and free her like he promised.  Could have been done better, basically it was a spacer from Epi I to Epi III."
"Mar 23, 2012",3.5,"Attack of the clones could have been a really good movie actually, if it werent for the awful and full of garbage love scenes. Plus, the bad performance by Hayden Christensan and few others. However, besides those issues that annoyed me and others, the movie still remains a good action film for what good it has. There's alot of great things that this movie has, from the music, to the mystery(when there was some) and the action. But sadly these flaws and few minor others keep this film from raising to its true potential."
"Mar 19, 2012",3.5,"Better than Episode I, but nothing too special here."
"Mar 18, 2012",1,"Anyone who claims this installment of the franchise - and let's be honest, that's about as heartfelt a description as it deserves - is better than The Phantom Menace is fooling themselves. The cardboard dialogue and acting completely tank the story. which is pretty thin to begin with. Mr. Lucas seems content sitting in a chair in a soundstage decorated with green screen to tell a story that should be full of passion and angst, shot on real locations with real background actors - not soulless CGI projections. A terrible waste of an opportunity to win back the fans, Attack of the Clones sinks deeper into the hole The Phantom Menace dug for itself and doesn't attempt to crawl out. Rather, it deficates in its own living space. Terrible. Thank goodness Revenge of the Sith was pretty decent, or else this prequel trilogy would have been a complete disaster."
"Mar 18, 2012",4,"Star wars episode 2: Attack of the Clones has a story that leads to a more intriguing premise centered around the film. Even though the story won't be as exciting as the original films, it still has sone great action sequences and amazing visual effects as usual."
"Mar 17, 2012",1,"This is a terrible movie, and here is why. It LIES to you. This is what the movie is made up of: 
1. Hey look, crazy visual effects and action 
2. Complete GARBAGE dialog with stale cinematography 
3. Hey look, lightsabers 
4. Politics 
5. Hey look, it's Boba Fett 
6. Romance 
7. Hey look, it's Padme, Anikan, and Obiwan wearing outfits that fit the same wardrobe color scheme of Luke, Han, and Leia to give you a flase sense of nostalgia 

Do you get the point? It sickens me George Lucas. This is worse then Transformers, and thats not even an exaggeration."
"Mar 16, 2012",4,"Star Wars: Episode ll - Attack of the Clones is a far way better then the first one with more visual, good performance by all our cast, and more coherent action."
"Mar 16, 2012",4,"Much better than the first. The acting is much better, the dialogue is a little bit better, and now we have an emotional subplot to the prequel trilogy. The action scenes are a LOT better and the character of Anakin has improved by quite. Overall, this is definitely a movie worth watching."
"Mar 16, 2012",4,Visually exciting and easily captivating.
"Mar 14, 2012",3.5,"Definitely watchable, and action-packed, and great viewing. As good as 1 &amp; 3? Not quite up to scratch."
"Mar 13, 2012",1.5,So boring. Snooze fest.
"Mar 12, 2012",1,"worst film in the saga. Plot goes absolutely nowhere. Bad acting, overuse of special effects. This episode sucked."
"Mar 12, 2012",1.5,Possibly the worst Star Wars film.
"Mar 12, 2012",1.5,The story and the characters hit a low point in the franchise. They have become mere tools used to support the surprisingly boring special effects.
"Mar 11, 2012",3,"Boring story, with uninteresting characters but some entertaining moments. Doesn't really add too much to the series but I don't think it's the worst one."
"Mar 10, 2012",4.5,"better than episode 1 this movie delivers the imagination of star wars to life with aliens with long necks to a cool fight scene at the end on geonosis. this wasn't the best of star wars but it is fun at certan points and keeps up the pace in the action.

"Mar 10, 2012",3.5,"A lot better than the episode one, this one has much of the thrills of the classic ones."
"Mar 10, 2012",2.5,My least favourite Star Wars Movie.
"Mar 09, 2012",4,"Second installment, Anakin and Padme realize there love and the Clone Wars begin."
"Mar 08, 2012",4,"""I like the water."" says Padme in one of the most vapid utterances in film history. While every scene featuring Anakin and Padme will make audiences cringe, Jango Fett, the Geonosis arena fights, and a veiled reference to the Death Star more than make up for it."
"Mar 08, 2012",2,hayden christensen lost half a star all on his own
"Mar 07, 2012",2,The worst of the six films. The story was stupid and the acting was terrible. As well as the dialogue. Lucas can't write dialogue to save his life.
"Mar 06, 2012",3.5,This movie is very flawed. Hayden Christensen's take on the character is annoying and almost laughable. Melodrama defined. But as it fills a necessary role in the Star Wars canon I guess it does the task decently.
"Mar 06, 2012",3,"I think this was my favorite of the new star wars movies, but not as good as the old ones."
"Mar 06, 2012",2.5,This is why you don't kill off Darth Maul!  Christopher Lee fails to pick up where he left off and add in the horrible acting of Christensen and you've got a recipe for a bad movie.
"Mar 05, 2012",3.5,Yoda with a lightsaber is awesome. That's pretty much worth the price of admission alone. Anakin and Amidala are getting worse.
"Mar 05, 2012",2,A continued limp away from a strong-strolling series before the days of blue-screened sets. Crippled by uncomfortably bad love scene dialogue.
"Mar 04, 2012",1.5,"These three movies are lame, lame and more lame.  The plot is lame, the acting is lame and the story is lame.  The movie is just flat out weak.  It is also very dark.  I don't go to the movies to be depressed.  Also, why would George Lucas take the powerfull Jedi and make them sooooo lame!  They had the Dark Sith Lord right under their noses and they can't even see him sitting right next to them.  Also, JarJar Binks was the worst character ever in any movie."
"Mar 04, 2012",2.5,"My least favorite of the series, but it still needs to be seen if you are going to watch all 6"
"Mar 04, 2012",2.5,"In my opinion the worst Star Wars movie...but since it is still a Star Wars movie it still has a fair amount of entertainment, well made battle scenes and stunning special effects."
"Mar 03, 2012",2.5,"Attack of the Clones looks great, the duel between Yoda and Count Dooku is excellent and the film had very good intentions, but the execution is so bad that it rendered the entire film mediocre. Rarely have I heard worse dialogue than this one as many lines spoken here are ridiculous and even hilarious. The action scenes are overwhelming, the film is too long and the romance between Padme and Anakin is so bland and all their scenes together are terrible. Hayden Christensen is simply an atrocious actor and he single-handedly destroyed this entire film. It is undoubtedly the worst entry in the entire franchise."
"Mar 02, 2012",3.5,The romance kind of sent it downhill but the fight scenes are great!!
"Mar 02, 2012",3,"The new three star wars are rough, and then with the unnecessary changes the old three not sure what I think."
"Mar 02, 2012",1,Along with the rest of the prequels this movie was straight off terrible. They make anikan out to be a monster from the start.
"Mar 01, 2012",2,"I can sit through this one. In the new trilogy the first one I make it through because I know Darth Maul will come. And the third one the end is great, but I can't find a reason to watch it. Also to romantic that it takes away the story.

"Feb 25, 2012",0.5,"Worse than TPM? never thought that could be possible, but oh boy it is. This is really Dawson's Creek with Star Wars characters."
"Feb 25, 2012",3.5,"Good Movie, But i think it was to slow pace in the begining it was fairly slow then at the end it was so much action with the battle ofGgeonosis and the lightsaber duel with Count Duku so i liked it but it could have been better"
"Feb 25, 2012",3,"The ""romance"" of Anakin and Padme just seems forced (SW pun not intended). The special effects are striking.. but its too much."
"Feb 25, 2012",2,It's final half hour has some amazing action and is genuinely entertaining. It's just a shame nearly 90 minutes of the most unengaging love story ever put to film precedes it. Great action and CGI does little to save a shoddy script that manages to squander an intriguing premise and almost ruin the Darth Vader character. And prepare yourself for the worst lightsaber duel in the entire saga
"Feb 25, 2012",1.5,"The worst film out of them all. Hayden Christensen cannot act and how the hell he was cast is beyond me. He is the Ja Ja Binks of this movie, terrible. And that is considering Ja Ja Binks is still in this movie. Unfortunately the rest of the cast don't perform either. It is saved however by some epic action scenes including Yoda fighting for the first time on screen!"
"Feb 23, 2012",1,"Just like it's predecessor we see the return of nonsensical plots and horribly jarring CGI everything.  However, this movie has something extra going for it!  This movie has an awful, sterile, and creepy love side story with 2 actors that obviously have no chemistry together.  This was supposed to be a story of a good person seduced by power, not of a whiney overzealous young man duped into betraying his friends."
"Feb 23, 2012",2,"Despite its criticism, I actually don't despise 'The Phantom Menace'. Yes, I agreed 100% that Jar Jar was awful, Jake Lloyd was irritating, and there was too much CGI. But it seemed to at least carry a little bit of weight, even if it didn't hold a candle to them. However, even having addressed the issues that Episode I had, 'Attack of the Clones' is by far the worst of the 6. Hayden Christensen is WAY worse than Jake Lloyd, Natalie Portman is a good actress, but her performance seems incredibly flat in this film, and the magnificent Christopher Lee is wasted on a mediocre and disappointingly underwritten villain."
"Feb 22, 2012",1,The biggest sin of a movie is boredom but AOTC reminds that reason of total missunderstood may be also movie so bad that turns his seriousness into unintentional long laugh. Anakin's line about sand attribute is the best example. Stop it now!
"Feb 22, 2012",3.5,This is the best of the three prequel. Great battle scenes that accommodated with fantastic SFX. But still can't be called classic as original trilogy!!
"Feb 21, 2012",2.5,Not exactly memorable.
"Feb 21, 2012",1,Evil ( Hayden Christianson ) has never been more bland.
"Feb 21, 2012",4.5,"This is my favourite of the whole series. Love all the action, the love story, the way it leads to the inevitable corruption of Anakin."
"Feb 20, 2012",3.5,"A big improvement over the first episode, but it still suffers from a uneven plot and underdeveloped characters"
"Feb 20, 2012",1.5,The weakest in the Star Wars saga.
"Feb 20, 2012",4,"A definite redeemer from TPM, but still doesn't have the flavor of the original trilogy. But, I'd watch it again."
"Feb 20, 2012",2.5,"The dialogue is painfully bad, but some nice action sequences and Ewan McGregor's continued presence make this a tolerable movie."
"Feb 19, 2012",1.5,Liked it as a kid.... well that's pretty much it
"Feb 19, 2012",2,"Pour la scène dans l'arène, la planète des clones et Jango Fett."
"Feb 19, 2012",3,"Attack of the Clones was a definite improvement over Phantom Menace but it does not compare with Empire Strikes Back. But then Empire is one of the greatest movies of all time.

The story wasn't too bad but the dialogue and the acting, especially Hayden Christensen as Anakin. You would think Lucas would have cast someone that can act for his title role. The man that will be Darth Vader. But then Jake Lloyd was just as bad. I don't think he had them audition. He just picked from a stack of headshots and figured if they can't act, he'll fix it in Post Production. He comes off as a total stalker in his pursuit of Padme. I can't imagine any girl finding him attractive. Especially after he confesses to murdering all of the sand people, any sane girl would run for the hills. When he finally makes his move and kisses her, it is so painful to watch.

Ewan McGregor on the other hand really kicks ass in this movie. I totally buy him as a young Ben Kenobi. However, Lucas doesn't really explain why the Jedi are so weak in Episodes IV thru VI. No super speed or lightning fast lightsaber battles. But in Clones, Kenobi shows why he is a Jedi Master. His duel with Jango Fett and General Grievous are priceless.

Speaking of Jango Fett, Lucas finally delivers what Boba Fett never did. We finally get to see a Fett kick some ass both in Hand to Hand Combat and in Slave I. The scene in the Asteroid Field had some fantastic sounding explosions. It was a shame that Mace Windu had to go and cut his head off. But knowing the Star Wars fans, they'll find a way to bring him back in the comic books or graphic novels. (both Boba Fett and Darth Mail were brought back to life in the expanded universe).

Mace ""Bad Ass Mofo"" Windu was also one of the good things this movie had going for it. Who would have thought Sam Jackson wpuld be in a Star Wars Movie but he brings it as a Jedi Master in Clones and Sith.

Natalie Portman is just average in this movie. I think playing off of Hayden actually makes her seem worse than she is but her dialogue is also poorly written. It just isn't believable that she would fall for Anakin. And Some of her hair styles are just ridiculous.

The fanboy-bait lightsaber duel between Yoda and Dooku was dumb. I just laughed watching Yoda hopping and flipping all over the place. I did enjoy the Jedi Battle Bowl.

All in all, a decent movie but it was another letdown by Lucas. I think he should have gotten other people to direct these movies. Can you imagine if Peter Jackson or Guillermo Del Toro or JJ Abrams would have directed?"
"Feb 17, 2012",4,I didn't think this movie was bad. I didn't get caught up in the hype like Episode I so wasn't disappointed.

"Feb 17, 2012",1.5,"It has a few things that make me enjoy it a little more than Episode I, such as the action scenes. But, I still don't think it's that great."
"Feb 17, 2012",2.5,"The most boring and empty one of the series, the romance is stale. The CGI and designs are less impressive, but the action scenes are a big step in the right way."
"Feb 16, 2012",3.5,"Good movie! A lot better than Phantom Menace, Not as good as Revenge Of The Sith, A New Hope, and definitely not as good as the best Star Wars movie, The Empire Strikes Back, but a good movie nonetheless. I don't really buy Padme and Anakin's relationship, I really didn't. In Revenge Of The Sith, the acting was a bit better by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, so I bought it more. The clones were cool. Jango was too, and the special effects were amazing. But the best part: The battle of Geonosis, the battle of Geonosis was awesome. That is really the best part of the movie. I liked the battle scenes. The lightsaber battles were good, but the battle of Geonosis is what made the movie. I recommend it, check it out."
"Feb 15, 2012",2,"How could anyone think this is better than the Phantom Menace? As much legitimate hate as that film gets, I can't even watch this one . . ."
"Feb 15, 2012",1.5,"As a Star Wars fan, this movie was a total puke.  I was so bored with the lackluster story and piss poor display of special effects.  All these great actors went to waste in a studio of green walls.  Lucas was too concerned with giving his fan boys a Yoda fight and a hard-on, rather than keep the majority interested in the story.  These prequels were a bad idea."
"Feb 14, 2012",0.5,Thanks to Anakin this film is unwatchable
"Feb 14, 2012",4,"A hair slow, but we begin to see what Anakin was like and what begins to push him to become Vader, and the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin is shown"
"Feb 13, 2012",3,Lucas' desire to stick with relative unknowns backfired - they're unknowns for a reason.   Hayden Christensen's wooden and laconic performance is painful to watch.  Lucas should have brought in some more help in writing the dialogue and casting.  The movie has some good sequences but some horrid CGI.  This could have been so much better.
"Feb 13, 2012",1,"Lazy, cheesy, and above all, BORING AS HELL. If it weren't for Episode 3, the Star Wars prequels would have been the biggest disappointment to ever happen in cinema."
"Feb 13, 2012",0.5,"Worst of the series!!!!!!! Poorly written, lack of story, and lack of character development. Just Plain terrible horrible!!!!!!!!"
"Feb 13, 2012",1.5,Never did like this movie. It almost ruined Star Wars' influence.
"Feb 13, 2012",0.5,"Death of a beloved franchise. Whenever I see robotic acting these days I say: ""Damn that guy was a straight Hayden""

Jango Fett earned the 10%, everything else was shit. How do you go from the epic Darth Maul fight scene to red face/blue face/red face/blue face? 

If you want this movie summed up in one 2 second scene, find the part near the end where the Natalie Portman is thrown from the starship and runs in the sand. Yikes!"
"Feb 13, 2012",0.5,a terrible cartoon of a movie completely relying on special effects and stale boring acting.
"Feb 13, 2012",1.5,The worst of the Star Wars Trilogies.
"Feb 12, 2012",1,poopoo but not as smelly as ROTS
"Feb 12, 2012",2.5,"The movie was OK, but still not as good as the original. Anakin Skywalker had the worst lines in the movie. The redeeming scene was the battle with Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Count Dooku."
"Feb 12, 2012",3.5,"I thought the love story plot was great. Sweet and sincere, it shows Padme and Anakin accepting their love for each other and just giving in. It's a VERY important part of the series. Without them, there would be no Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Galactic Empire, or anything."
"Feb 12, 2012",4,Thank god Lucas manages to pick it up after Phantom Menace
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"While Attack of the Clones still doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie, it is definitely an improvement over Phantom Menace. Most of the time anyway. At least this time around I can actually assign certain traits and personalities to the characters, since the lines are now usually delivered with a bit of conviction. The story is also easier to understand and the action scenes are better (Obi-Wan versus Jango is notably good because it doesn't reek of obvious choreography like the other fights do). However, when this one gets bad, it gets even more insipid than Phantom Menace, surprisingly enough. The romance dialogue between Anakin and Padme is too melodramatic and silly and there are just so many nitpicks that flat-out bother me (Why do the child Jedis use lightsabers? Why are there so many plot holes in the Padme assassination arc? Why, when Anakin confesses to Padme that he slaughtered men, women, and children, does Padme just stare stupidly and tell him that ""to be angry is to be human""?) Like Phantom Menace, this one can be skipped as well, but at least this one has some fun in it. If it catches your fancy, check it out; just expect really silly things every now and then."
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,"It was hard to decide what was better, this or TPM. I really miss the warmth of Liam Neeson, but Ewan Mcgregor does a good job. In this film he isn't quite as likeable as he will be but Obi-Wan does care for Anakin. I thought Hayden as Anakin did a good job on Tatooine, which was the best part of the film, especially the slaughter and confession scenes. Watching Aotc makes the tatooine portion of TPM especially tragic due to the dark circumstances that force anakin to return in AOTC. I AOTC has the worst lightsaber duels of the saga, and the geonosis arena was disappointing due to the jedi being pasted together and thus creating an artificial sense of scale that doesn't work well. The visuals are the most unique in this film out of all six, and I felt the film's plot was more compelling than TPM."
"Feb 11, 2012",4,Better than what people claim it to be. The direction in particular is impeccable.
"Feb 11, 2012",2.5,I don't particularly find Episodes II and III THAT bad. At least no where near as bad as the clusterxxxx that was Episode I.
"Feb 10, 2012",1,"Watched this on TV for the first time in many, many years. Even worse then I remember. Fake, bad acting, and very dumb cheesy dialogue."
"Feb 10, 2012",0.5,Worst of the prequels
"Feb 10, 2012",3.5,"Watchable entry in the prequel series, This film contends with the deletion of the awesome Liam Neeson, which is balanced by the addition of the legendary Christopher Lee. The film score wasn't as stirring as in the previous film. Incredible battle sequences marred only by the ludicrous light-sabre duel between Yoda and Dooku.... I mean, really?"
"Feb 09, 2012",3,"Attack of the Clones still fails to reach the cinematic heights posted by the original trilogy. However, Lucas has at least attempted to learn from his mistakes. This doesn't necessarily mean Attack of the Clones is a masterpiece, but certainly it is miles ahead of the Phantom Menace in all aspects. The dialogue, while not exactly poetic, is a little better, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are more confident in their acting chops, and the story is more in tune with the saga's roots. However, despite all of this, the movie still has some faults, including that egregious middle section with Anakin and Padme that absolutely has no dramatic depth, and in general, whenever those too talk, it's just painful. Lucas honestly doesn't get love. At all. It has to be mentioned as well... Hayden Christensen... He's so awful, whenever he speaks, I want to through something through the TV. How anybody thought he was perfect for the role is beyond me. Those aside, Attack of the Clones is a marked improvement, filled with sweet battle sequences and action pieces, most impressive being the battle between the Jedi and the Droids."
"Feb 09, 2012",3,Bad acting from Hayden Christensen and a bloated running time ruin what could have been a great film
"Feb 09, 2012",4,they ruined my childhood
"Feb 08, 2012",3,"Meh. Good, but Hayden Christiansen REALLY overacted this one."
"Feb 08, 2012",3,"Like the 1st one, I watched this movie for Natalie Portman But I was blown away by Yoda. hahahaha that lil' green fucker stole the show for me with his fight scene."
"Feb 07, 2012",3,the battles are good but the movie falls flat in many other places.
"Feb 06, 2012",2,not much of an improvement whatsoever.
"Feb 06, 2012",2,"Terrible, terrible performances from Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman turn what could be a decent film into a rant of monkey-speak. Plus, Lucas relies too much on CGI. When 85% of the film is fake, something is lost. Really, really the sore thumb that sinks the series into pits of despair."
"Feb 05, 2012",4,"It's a great sequel that still emphases on great visual effects and great lightsaber action. It is an improvement from The Phantom Menace (even though it's the weakest in the saga, it doesn't make it a bad movie, just the Jake Lloyd as young Anakin made it lackluster), but it still has that same fire and that same ""Wow factor"" that shows us why we love Star Wars in the first place. The big battle at the end is what real fans wanted all along, the mass of the jedi order trying to keep the peace, but are thrusted into war. Amazing performances by Sam Jackson, Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Lee. Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman also deserves mentioning, because their characters were far more complicated sentimentally.
Less Jar Jar is still better than too much Jar Jar, even though he wasn't that bad.
I do have to admit, seeing Jango Fett and young Boba brought me memories of why I liked Boba from the old movies. But  Temuera Morrison made me love the character even more with that space-desperado gunslinger portrayal.
Even if the love story is vastly criticized, it was still a vital piece of story we could not overlooked. It is why our beloved Vader-to-be sacrificed his oath and duty... for love. As it's still is a space-opera, there still must have had emotions or the movie would worst than people say it is.
I find it ironic though that after the original trilogy, people wanted more FX and lightsaber battles; they got it and they're still complaining over a story that they think they know better than its creator. I say, enjoy the prequels for what they are : Star Wars! Not what some frustrated fanboy wanted it to be, because again, it is not their story to tell, it's still Lucas'."
"Feb 05, 2012",0.5,"Except for the battle on Geonosis, this movie is awful. Hayden Christensen might be the world's worst actor"
"Feb 04, 2012",2,"The second installment of the prequel trilogy does one thing right by adding more action to the mix. On the other hand, this is still a glacially paced movie with boring political ""intrigue"" and many scenes that run far too long. Another oft-criticized point are the love scenes, which is something I concur with. I think that Natalie Portman is a talented actress, but she'd need the combined strength of every classical Greek muse in order to sell the script's infantile notion of romantic sentiment."
"Feb 04, 2012",4,NOT THE BEST BUT GOOD
"Feb 04, 2012",5,"With a forty-five-minute-long battle sequence to end all battle sequences, and intriguing backstory provided for one of the original trilogy's most mysterious characters, Attack of the Clones more than deserves to wear Lucas's name and flagship banner."
"Feb 03, 2012",4,This is probably the best out of the new star wars movies
"Feb 02, 2012",2.5,"Slightly better than it's predecessor, but it still is a cluttered mess of CG and one dimensional story telling."
"Feb 02, 2012",4.5,Yoda lightsaber battle. Nuff Said.
"Feb 01, 2012",4,"this was the film that got me into star wars as a kid, and even though it's not a great film, it's my favorite of the prequels and I still consider it a sort of guilty-pleasure"
"Feb 01, 2012",1.5,"I can't have been the only one confused here. So let's begin:

1) Anakin looked like he was 7 in the last movie and Padme looked like she was 27 (Though they were supposed to be 9 and 14). Suddenly, you've got Padme who STILL looks 27, but Anakin's has time warped into a 22 year old who acts like an angsty 16 year old.

2) Padme is somehow turned on by his angst for which she berates him and gives him the evil eye, as well as his horrible attempts to woo her by comparing her with sand.

3) They don't explain properly in the movie why this relationship is a problem. Would it have been so hard to say ""If a Jedi gets married he is kicked out of the order?"" And I STILL don't know why it's a problem on her end as a Senator.

End of confusion. Other qualms I had with the movie:
-Anakin's a horrible actor with horrible lines (Heck, EVERYONE had horrible lines).
-More green screen environments. Everything looks plastic and fake as usual.
-Quite a transition from the first ""sell kids toys"" movie to melodramtic romance chopping people's heads off.
-I really don't remember anything but the romance parts and murdering spree. That demonstrates how important the side plot with the whole ""war"" thing is to this story."
"Feb 01, 2012",2,"Some good action scenes, but they are too few and far between"
"Jan 31, 2012",3,"Everyone knows this isn't a great movie, but it's not horrible either. As simply an effort to continue the prequel trilogy of Star Wars, it does a fair job, and it's better than Episode I."
"Jan 31, 2012",1,Vi no cinema. Uma merrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrda!
"Jan 31, 2012",3.5,"I generally liked this movie. I was definitely better than Phantom Menace but still it wasn't great. It was decent though.

"Jan 31, 2012",3.5,Could've been better.  Yoda drawing his lightsaber was the only draw.
"Jan 31, 2012",5,This movie came to be because of one simple stamens in the episode 4 the new hope when obi wan says he fought along side ankin sky walker in the clone wars. This movie is also when everything basically goes to hell for the republic. This movie is a lot of fun with huge epic battles plus or has inspired the never ending series in cartoon network the clone wars...
"Jan 31, 2012",3.5,"An improvement on its predecessor, Attack of the Clones is filler, but stylish and necessary filler, with some of what made the originals great becoming more noticeable."
"Jan 30, 2012",0.5,George Lucas achieves the impossible by making a movie that's even worse than the Phantom Menace.
"Jan 30, 2012",4,Anakan is whiny. Just like Luke.
"Jan 30, 2012",4.5,My favorite of the second trilogy.
"Jan 30, 2012",2,"The worst Star Wars movie made. Horrible acting, crappy love story and the only cool scene is yoda vs count doku"
"Jan 30, 2012",3,"A huge improvement, but a forgettable entry in the Star Wars saga."
"Jan 30, 2012",2.5,"The best of the new trilogy, you have a feeling that there is something dark and mysterious looming all over the place, assassins, secret armies and conspiracies within the republic and the Jedi order. Yoda looks like his former self and not like an old gremlin as he did in ep. I, this movie is far from perfect but it gives you insight to the original trilogy what with Boba Fett, the clone army these hint really makes the film more convincing as a prequel than the previous episode."
"Jan 29, 2012",2,"To quote Darth Vader from episode III, ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!""

Seriously though, worst star wars movie...

Don't see how so many people like this more than Phantom Menace..."
"Jan 29, 2012",1,The acting was terrible and the plot was pretty stupid
"Jan 29, 2012",1.5,"This episode of Star Wars is probably the most boring one is the saga. The only good scenes were the two major fight scenes toward the end, too bad you have to wait a long and boring hour and a half. If you're trying to understand Star Wars or you're a fan then this is obviously a must see, but a lot of Star Wars fans don't really like this movie as much as the others in the saga."
"Jan 28, 2012",4,"If I had to rank this with the other Star Wars movies, I would rank Attack of The Clones greater than Return of The Jedi, but that isn't much praise. The movie itself isn't bad or horrible, but I feel Hayden Christensen didn't fully realize the character of Anakin, or maybe it's the directors fault. The movie itself is beautiful with beautiful action sequences. This movie last a star because if the character of Anakin and the romantic subplot. Not a bad film but of course it is for Star Wars fans."
"Jan 28, 2012",3,Damn you george Lucas
"Jan 27, 2012",1.5,"The worst film in the saga.  The dialogue is more cringe-inducing than usual here, and for Star Wars that's saying something.  The romantic subplot is contrived, and the leads have no chemistry whatsoever. Much of the substance and politics that are so important to set the stage for the coming star wars are jettisoned in favor of whiny, poorly acted angst.  Plus the Clone wars are tacked on the end as an afterthought.  P.S. Yoda just looks ridiculous jumping and twirling around like a monkey on crack."
"Jan 27, 2012",0.5,too much politics and talk about the trade federation.  wasn't interested in most of it.
"Jan 27, 2012",0.5,"Equally as bad as the Phantom Menace. It has as many plot errors, bad writing, and boring shots. Except this time there is no annoying kid but instead a boring teenager that only complains and the most awkward romance to ever take place in a movie."
"Jan 26, 2012",3.5,"I think this is the weakest of the Star Wars Movies.  It has some strong parts, but some terribly weak ones as well.  Strong, it did have some solid action sequences and light sabre fights; not on par with the Darth Maul fights of Episode 1, but still decent.  I also liked the early sequence when Obi-Wan dives out the window to track down Padme's attempted assassin.  I also like how Boba Fett's origin was worked into the film.  Also, I thought Anakin going to town on the Sand People to be a strong turning point for the character and definitely the best thing about the charcter in this film.  Strikes against the film, it was too heavy on CGI.  Yoda was CGI, C-3PO was CGI, R2-D2 was CGI.  It just took away the real-feel of the original trilogy.  I know CGI was a big part of Episode 1, but it just felt overboard in this one.  Also, for the most part, Anakin was a detractor.  I like that his character had a certain arrogance because he is the powerful Chosen One, but that feels overshadowed by the fact that Hayden Christiansen plays him so WHINEY and CREEPY.  His dialogue with Padme is terrible and it makes no sense how she was won over by him.  Actually, for the most part, this film (and mostly the whole original Trilogy) is devoid of the charming dialogue of the first Trilogy.  I think that Anakin should have been played better, since he is kind of the linch-pin of the new Trilogy.  So overall, it's an alright film, leaves something to be desired, but it's still Star Wars."
"Jan 26, 2012",0.5,"Comprehensively, thoroughly, and absolutely does every single thing wrong that could possibly be done wrong in a Star Wars movie. Or any movie. It's stunning, for lack of a better word. This film is a bastardized, insanely overblown parody of what Star Wars originally was that reduces all of what made things like the Jedi and the Force remotely interesting into inconsequential drivel. But beyond that, it's just a really bad movie. Almost universally wooden acting, an aggressively brainless script containing some of the most howlingly bad dialogue of all time, clunky/dull editing, even the frigging blocking is bad. Literally the only thing this movie has going for it is that it manages to feel more like an actual movie than The Phantom Menace did (which would come across like something that was made for TV if it wasn't for the high budget effects)"
"Jan 26, 2012",2.5,"Worst SW film, the effects are good, and the action towards the end is nice, but the middle section is just... middling."
"Jan 25, 2012",3,Disappointing after watching Episode I.
"Jan 25, 2012",0.5,"Attack of the Clones tries to be more adult than The Phantom Menace, but Lucas's attempts at writing romantic dialogue and directing chaotic action scenes just create more flaws."
"Jan 24, 2012",0.5,One of the worst films ever made.
"Jan 24, 2012",3,"Weaker than the Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones provides a laughable love story, a run-of-the-mill detective story, and an eye-popping conclusion that contains more story in its visuals than it does in its script."
"Jan 24, 2012",2.5,"Starting to get the Star Wars series back on track after the complete waste of time that episode 1 turned out to be, this one still has to bridge between dreck and greatness."
"Jan 24, 2012",5,"First time or one hundreth time I still love the series starting with IV thru VI then I thru III. 
In which order do you watch them?"
"Jan 24, 2012",3.5,Last 45 minutes of the film are really the only things worth watching.
"Jan 23, 2012",1,"This movie has the MOST FORCED ROMANCE in cinema history. Every character was just a stale and emotionless card board cut out. Unlike ""Empire"", the film's characters don't feel or grow like real people. Lucas fails to convey everything: WATCH THESE PREQUEL REVIEWS NOW!!!: http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-wars/
THE MOST ENLIGHTENING THING YOU'LL EVER SEE!!!"
"Jan 23, 2012",4,"In A New Hope, Princess Leia informed Obi Wan Kenobi that he had ""served her father in the clone wars.""  This one line sparked a furore of interest all by itself.  What were the clone wars?  When did they happen?  The answer to this, and several other Star Wars questions, is answered in episode two, a movie that plays well at fill in the gaps.
Set ten years after the events of episode one, AOTC chronicles the beginnings of Anakin Skywalker's journey down the dark sides drive way and the first rumblings of the Empire coming into power.  The galaxy is in turmoil after a political idealist under the name of Count Dooku is persuading several star systems to break away from the republic with war seeming like the only outcome to bring these errant trouble makers back into line.  Having the future knowledge that we do, we all know this is just a part of the man who will eventually become the Emperor's dastardly scheme.
AOTC is no lighter than Phantom Menace on the political mumbo jumbo side of Star Wars but it is vital that this remains in the Star Wars saga as it does provide the background to all that is to come.  The film comes with a whole host of excellent new action sequences.  The opening one in particular shows the more urbane side of the Star Wars universe and the action sweeps through a vast city scape of speeders.  It's a far cry from Mos Eisley space port when it comes to Star Wars conurbations.
AOTC features the debut of one of the sagas most intriguing and popular characters, Boba Fett which is another way in which it fills in a few of the blanks on who Fett is and where he came from.  In addition, there is the new character of Jango Fett and a cracking Jedi vs Bounty Hunter, rain soaked scrap which ranks up there as one of the most brutally violent moments in Star Wars.
The returning cast as all still up to par, even if how Natalie Portman barely looks like she's aged a day is never explained, while Hayden Christiansen steps up to the challenge of playing the young Anakin Skywalker.  Probably the most sought after role for any actor in his mid-twenties at the turn of the century, Christiansen plays Skywalker very well.  At times he can be a little wooden but he oozes the arrogant naivety that the character needed while turning on the flashes of darkness when required.  His courtship of Padme Armidala was never going to be a popular plot line for Star Wars fans but it's handled well enough to show that it means something more than just where Luke and Leia come from.
Like Phantom Menace, Clones is by no means perfect and no on a par with the original trilogy.  The unwelcome droid-related humour is still way too present and the epic battles scenes are once again a blur of cgi and light sabres, and it's maybe fifteen minutes too long.
In the context of the whole Star Wars saga though, ATOC is an integral cog.  It's a stepping stone that was needed to get from parts one to three while filling in many bits of Star Wars history.  It's not probably going to ever be any fans favourite Star Wars movie but go with it and it's a great addition to legacy."
"Jan 23, 2012",5,The most kick-ass love story ever.
"Jan 22, 2012",2,"Oh my god. This has to be one of the most generic films of all time. I mean, the plot was generic, the love story between Hayden and Natalie is so laughable I'm still laughing right now XD, the characters are forgettable that I can't even remember them only that they were boring as hell, the action was even more unrealistic than the phantom menace that I can't believe I'm giving the phantom menace a positive, the dialogue is so badly written that I felt michael bay's 10 year old son wrote the screenplay. I can't describe it anymore that it's disappointing that it makes phantom menace look like star wars which it is never coming close to."
"Jan 22, 2012",4.5,This movie is pretty good. I admit the romance between Anakin and Padme is boring at times. But it holds up in my point of view.
"Jan 21, 2012",3,"Jake Loyd made a departure, only to be replaced by Hayden Christiansen. Cant decide which is worse, The Phantom Menance, or this."
"Jan 20, 2012",3.5,this one was better than episode 1
"Jan 20, 2012",1,"Slightly better than phantom menace, although it's like a choice between drowning and burning alive...you're left begging for another option."
"Jan 18, 2012",3,"Hayden Christensen is a disaster, utterly unconvincing, I would have preferred to fast forward to certain key plot scenes and had someone fill in the the blanks just to continue this saga. On to episode III. Watch it for Yoda, Jackson and to complete the narrative.

I would like to add that most of the actors in the movie deliver what is expected of them, and the Original trilogy references are wonderful, Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine deliver excellent performances."
"Jan 18, 2012",3,This film is a HUGE improment over the abombination of man kiind that is Star Wars Episode 1. The romance is kind of corny but there is a ton of action and it never takes a break.
"Jan 18, 2012",3.5,"""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones"" is a decent movie and an improvement over ""The Phantom Menace"". the story follows Anakin Skywalker and his path to becoming a Jedi, and there has been an assassination attempt on Padme and Obi Wan and Anakin try to find out who would do this and why. as they discover who would do this they also learn of an attack that puts all of the Jedi at risk. the story is definitely better told in this movie compared to ""The Phantom Menace"". i found the story very interesting in the first half of the movie, but as the second half begins i felt lost of interest and felt that this movie was a bit to long. sure its better then ""The Phantom Menace"" but the story loses interest and since the story loses interest then that means that the characters lose interest as well. with those two major flaws it really hurts it more if its to long, and ""Attack Of The Clones"" is indeed to long. i thought the action was done very well and the dramatic scenes with Anakin where pretty powerful. overall ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones"" is a decent movie, but has some very big flaws that keep it from being great.
Replay Value: Moderate"
"Jan 18, 2012",4,not as good as the first...but still very good *glee*
"Jan 17, 2012",5,Anakin is SOOOOOOO hot!!!!
"Jan 17, 2012",4.5,"Don't hate on this one, it's not the worst. Necessary love story aside, it's a got a great storyline and my favorite light saber duel of all time."
"Jan 17, 2012",4,I don't really like the romance part in this episode but it's still good.
"Jan 16, 2012",4,"You gotta love it. Hayden Christensen as a whining teen, Ewan McGregor as Obiwan to be. Better than Episode I. Great visuals."
"Jan 16, 2012",3,"Certainly an improvement over The Phantom Menace but still is a big dissapointment. The script writing especially Anakin's ""grains of sand"" monologe are painful and shitty. The scenery is cool and impressive and the special effects are great too. It is a winner in scenery but is a loser in script and writing. It ends up being an average movie and nothing compared to the original trilogy."
"Jan 16, 2012",2.5,"The movie visually looks amazing....design is beautiful but totally forgetable.....the plot is weak, and there is absolutely no story behind the characters.....most of the cast is not good....specially decision to cast Christensen as Anakin, just doesn't have that strong personality to make us belive that one day that will be Darth Vader, probably the most famous villian in movie history........."
"Jan 15, 2012",2.5,"Improving over The Phantom Menace, but still not quite good. Creation of clone army and introducing Count Dooku raised the quality of this movie, but retention of Jar Jar Binks and casting Hayden Christensen as Anakin were a terrible choices (his perfomance wasn't any better than perfomance from Jake Lloyd)!"
"Jan 15, 2012",2,"thanks hayden, your shitty acting has ruined  franchise"
"Jan 14, 2012",4.5,Awsome but story is ok
"Jan 14, 2012",4,great film but anakin deserved a bit more of a fight.
"Jan 14, 2012",3,"The second film in the epic Star Wars series is about the same of Episode 1,but sadly has the same problems as the original. The acting is horrible, specially Hayden Christensen`s acting (Anakin) and the worst part is the lame and horribly acted romance between Anakin and Padme."
"Jan 14, 2012",3.5,"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is an improvement over the first, but doesn't have what it takes to reach the original classics"
"Jan 14, 2012",3.5,"This was the first Star Wars movie I saw and to be honest I was blown away and quite impressed. I remember around this time there was a mini-series out on Cartoon Network with the same title, or it may have been Attack of the Clones but the two of them together made me really dig the Star Wars series. If I can say one thing this is probably my favorite Star Wars movie and it does rely partially on the fact that it was my first, but my favorite parts are as follows:
-The dynamics between the main characters and the subsequent support characters in the clones and the evil baddies.
-The actual clone back story itself and how thoroughly it is explored. 
-The FIGHTS!
-The relationships between the main characters and in particular Padme and Anakin. 

So in a nutshell what do I say about this movie?
Definitely watch it, and if you are going to, take the time and start at the beginning.  Skipping around really throws a monkey wrench in things."
"Jan 14, 2012",4.5,"Better than the first, but still not the best."
"Jan 12, 2012",0.5,Barf! Hayden Christensen killed this movie and Episode III
"Jan 12, 2012",3,"Not saying this Star Wars was bad,it was pretty good,but its not my favorite if not one my least but not in a bad way."
"Jan 11, 2012",1.5,"I feel heavily obligated to review the entire Star Wars series so here I go. I just want to start off by saying Attack of the Clones is better than the Phantom menace...that's saying almost nothing though. Again, the focus in this prequel is space politics, but with less emphasis. The main plot is the Sith Lord Count Dooku wants to kill Padme Amidala so Anakin has to protect her. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan Kenobi does investigative research on a clone army being built for the Republic. Anakin is the main focus of the movie since we dwell further into how he is to become Darth Vader. But I just can't buy into it enough. Anakin suffers throughout the movie, I get that, but he's poorly potrayed and poorly written. Hayden Christensen is terrible as Anakin. He will bring almost no emotion in one scene and then too much emotion in the next. All he does in the movie is whine about his emotions. It's enough to make anyone yell ""SHUT UP AND TURN INTO DARTH VADER ALREADY!"" He's especially bad in the incredibly cheesy romance scenes. Him and Padme have no chemistry. It's really sad to see Natalie Portman act so wooden when she just won an Oscar a year ago. Ewan McGregor did a good job in this movie though. As a matter of fact, there were some scenes where you could tell he was having alot of fun making this movie, so good for him. Samuel L. Jackson brings out the badass in Mace Windu and Frank Oz does well as a voice actor for Yoda. Christopher Lee is in this as Count Dooku and it was really cool to see him in a Star Wars movie. (Even if it is a prequel.) The special effects are usually really cool and this movie is no exception. The action scenes are good, but not great though. I thought it was cool to see Yoda in action and showing just how powerful he really is. In the end however, this movie is just another train wreck. It's badly written, poorly acted by a select few, tedious, campy, pretentious and lacking in substance. However, this is the last Star Wars movie that I can consider ""bad."""
"Jan 11, 2012",2,"Just as brainless as its predecessor, but made worse by the lack of chemistry between Christensen and Portman, and the acting abilities (or lack thereof) possessed by the former."
"Jan 11, 2012",2.5,"not bad, worst of the saga though..."
"Jan 11, 2012",4,"Star Wars: Episode II is better than Episode I, in terms of maturity and plot. The great thing about Star Wars, in general, is that George Lucas has created a wonderful masterpiece, a sci-fi world out of nothing - and makes it real. This second installment serves as a link between the discovery of young Anakin and how he all grew up and becoming suspiciously dangerous - and it has done a great job in doing it.."
"Jan 10, 2012",3,"Disculpen mi falta de objetividad, es que soy fan de la saga"
"Jan 09, 2012",2.5,"I honestly prefer Phantom Menace, I did not want to know any more about Boba Fett he was a perfect character until George Lucas ruined him in this."
"Jan 09, 2012",1.5,I'm hard-pressed to recall a more boring movie.
"Jan 09, 2012",2.5,"A little less boring than the first one but a little more stupid, rushed, and some pretty shitty acting at times drag it down. Thanks to some good action and scenery and Christopher Lee to keep me from not liking this movie at all."
"Jan 09, 2012",3.5,"This is better than Episode I. Starting the movie with Anakin as a young adult rather than a child, like Episode I, made it more entertaining."
"Jan 09, 2012",3,Clones clones clones... zzz
"Jan 08, 2012",3,"I give this movie three stars for the gorgeous visuals, and the sexy Hayden Christensen. The acting, imho, was absolute, over dramatic shat. I've always wondered how two, otherwise talented actors, could fail to suspend believability to such a degree in a film."
"Jan 08, 2012",3.5,"I love star wars, and parts of this movie i loved, like the battle of Geonosis, and the lightsaber duels, but Hayden Christensen was terrible in this movie. I heard somewhere that Leo was considered for this role, and if it would have been him then this movie would have been way better"
"Jan 08, 2012",4,Ten years after its release and polished up in hi def this is great entertainment. One star shaved off for the dialogue and some of the melodrama though!
"Jan 08, 2012",3,"The highlights of this film are seeing a young Boba Fett, Anakin losing it with the Sandpeople, R2-D2 stepping it up, C3-PO calling R2 an idoit,  PadmÃ (C) Amidala having more balls than Anakin, and learning of the clone army.  Hayden Christensen was a horrible casting choice, he abosolutely ruined the character with his childish, creepy and tearful performace. You don't have to be a Jedi to know he's crazy and needs to be place on 5150, possibly 5250. Yoda's scenes look awful, too CGI, in fact, all the special effects look like a video game qualtiy."
"Jan 07, 2012",0.5,"Really TERRIBLE Acting and dumb plot
Acting:F
Plot:F
Entertainment value:D-"
"Jan 07, 2012",0.5,"Say what you want about The Phantom Menace (no really, please do- it's terrible), but at least you could argue that it tried. Attack of the Clones doesn't even try. You like lightsabers? Here's 500,000 lightsabers. You like Bobba Fett? Here have another one. If you like to watch story-less, character-less, thoughtless fan services that look more like video games than actual films, then this is the movie for you."
"Jan 07, 2012",2,"Attack of the Clones is the highly anticipated sequel to Phantom of Menace and of course the 2nd movie in the second trilogy. Unfortunately this movie also might be the worst of all the Star Wars series as this movie really disappointed me on so many fronts. Much of the problems center around Haydn Christensen's ability to act as it is hard not to almost laugh at the Romance arc in the film with Portman. Phantom Menace at least provided us with an excellent new villain in Darth Maul, but we don't have anything close to that in this movie. Attack of the Clones does progress the story and explain some of the developments of the War, but is really not worth watching again."
"Jan 07, 2012",4.5,I viewed it six times opening day.  I'm not joking.
"Jan 06, 2012",3.5,Not that bad. It has a great last 20 minutes that begs for more.
"Jan 06, 2012",3.5,"I like it better than the first film of the second trilogy, but the love scenes are boring.  But it does have one of the best Star War's duel."
"Jan 04, 2012",3,this is killed by hayden christensens horrible acting
"Jan 04, 2012",4,"While there is some lousy acting and a fairly bad script, the energy, excitement, and epic-ness of the original trilogy is final showing its head.  The Stunning CGI, the amazing battles and the phenomenal score make this film an exciting, if flawed, epic entry into the star wars universe."
"Jan 04, 2012",1,Worst Star Wars movie
"Jan 03, 2012",2.5,"Still pretty boring, and Hayden Christensen is cringe-worthy."
"Jan 03, 2012",5,"A definite improvement over The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones breathes new life into the Star Wars saga with a thickening plot and mysterious characters. The special effects and incredible landscapes are gorgeously shot, while the characters of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Count Dooku, and Yoda are incredibly fascinating. Once again, the dialogue between Anakin and Padme is a bit wooden, but their interactions are more believable this time around. Overall, Attack of the Clones is a wonderfully exciting film that will leave fans truly begging to encounter the events of the next film."
"Jan 02, 2012",3,Crass dialogue and terrible acting aren't enough to redeem what was probably the most far-fetched and inconsequential of the Star Wars films.
"Jan 01, 2012",3.5,"Better than Episode I (which you could say for just about any film), but still not quite there.  Phenomenal effects, of course, and a much better Yoda (CG rather than muppet).  Bare Natalie Portman midriff.  Come to think of it, not a bad film at all!"
"Jan 01, 2012",2.5,"REVIEW#22
         I love the Star Wars movies but this is the worst film in the franchise in my opinion.It had no good light saber battles,it was more of a escape movie. They did have that big fight at the end but this movie was just boring.It had some good battles but it was just to much talk, not enough action."
"Dec 31, 2011",1.5,Not even the Yoda-lightsaber scene could redeem this.
"Dec 30, 2011",2.5,"Slipping here.  The love story was unbearable.  Young Anakin was not written well, or well acted.  Next."
"Dec 30, 2011",3,"Other reviews state that Episode II was better then Episode I, but I think I'm the opposite. I like I better then this one.  Sure more of the story is finally coming out, but the acting in this one was horrible."
"Dec 30, 2011",2.5,"Re-watched for the first time since it was released.  Did not age well, only slightly better than episode one."
"Dec 29, 2011",3.5,"The forced, sappy romance in this sequel, coupled with more politics, drags the whole thing down. There is some fun and excitement to be had in last fourth of the movie, but the journey there is often quite the opposite."
"Dec 29, 2011",3,"I really had no strong feelings one way or the other... just a general, meh."
"Dec 29, 2011",4,"Some Cheesy written dialogue from George Lucas, and some over the top acting by Hayden Christensen really keep this one from being something special.  But man was it bad ass to see Yoda in a lightsaber duel for the first time!"
"Dec 29, 2011",1.5,Someone should have stopped Lucus after the other Star Wars Trilogy.
"Dec 29, 2011",3.5,"Not bad, but Hadden Christensen wasn't exactly the best actor for the job as Anakin Skywalker."
"Dec 28, 2011",4.5,"Hayden Christensen is HOT, even if he isn't the best at acting."
"Dec 28, 2011",0.5,Terrible movie. Made Howard the Duck look like a AAA title
"Dec 28, 2011",4,I love all the Star Wars movies!
"Dec 28, 2011",1.5,"As a whole, it came off to me as an assembly line production, devoid of any real emotional involvement from anyone. A film that coldly exploits the works of craftsmen and artists in a sterile, computer controlled environment; resulting in colourful crisp images that are played in a sequence. There's no creativity, and Star Wars: Episode II borrows ideas from previous Star Wars films, in accordance with the business the prequels have become to profit its cult status."
"Dec 27, 2011",0.5,"edited better but still a complete mess of a film.  from dialog to story, to cg."
"Dec 27, 2011",4.5,It's like a fine wine.
"Dec 27, 2011",4,"The dialogue within the script should've been heard before being said so to see if it works right to the film's matching level of good acting. The level of Christensen's performance as Anakin is a comparison to where his character is in training and believing he can be a strong Jedi. Aside from those flaws, the middle chapter of the Star Wars prequel trilogy is probably the best of the prequels by consisting more to the mind in action, performances, storytelling, and visual effects. (B+)

(Full review coming soon)"
"Dec 27, 2011",2.5,The second-worst Star Wars Film.
"Dec 27, 2011",3.5,"Yoda is bad to the bone, and we get to see that for the first time in Episode II - Attack of the Clones as Yoda battles Count Dooku (played by Christopher Lee) at the end of the film.  Lucas' superior sound and special effects are prominently displayed in this sci-fi epic, the fifth release in the six movie series.  The great Frank Oz is central to this story in his characterization of Yoda.  Hayden Christiansen's portrayal of Anakin is spotty, and Natalie Portman is equally shaky as Padme.  Ewan McGregor is adequate as Obi-wan Kenobi.  Despite weak acting, generally, this action-packed film was a welcome contribution to the Star Wars series."
"Dec 26, 2011",1.5,"This is my least favorite film in the saga. Many people say that this movie is an improvement over the Phantom Menace, and they're probably right. Unlike the TPM, this one has somewhat of a story (even if it doesn't make much sense). And there are action scenes that I found entertaining even if they're CGI-heavy. But the awful romantic dialogue between Anakin and Padme and Hayden Christensen's awful performance ruin the movie for me. They make the movie painful to get through."
"Dec 26, 2011",3.5,The only thing I really liked was the Jedi vs The Clones fight scene and the Yoda vs Count Dooku fight. So epic!
"Dec 26, 2011",3.5,This was the most romantic of the series. It showed the adorable relationship between Anakin and Padmey or however you spell her name.
"Dec 25, 2011",3,"Can anyone act in this movie? Best part of this one, Anakin gets PMS and kills sand people."
"Dec 25, 2011",4.5,great movie hayden christensen is totally gorgeous................. i love it
"Dec 25, 2011",5,i um. i really enjoy these starwars movies. i um...think they will play on big screens in heaven
"Dec 25, 2011",4,"not as good as the other star wars movies, but still entertaining"
"Dec 24, 2011",3,"it may have special effects, and Ewan McGregor  was a great Obi Wan Kenobi but everything else complete bull shit"
"Dec 23, 2011",3.5,"A big improvement over Phantom menace.  The action is better.  Still, the story is uninvolving and very confusing."
"Dec 22, 2011",5,My favorite of the prequels.
"Dec 22, 2011",3,"Lucas conseguiu melhorar muito em relacao ao episodio I, mas ainda tem alguns tropecos. Partindo agora para o III, nessa maratona de fim de ano."
"Dec 22, 2011",2.5,"Unlike episode 1 which has grown on me, this one I have grown to not like as much over the years.  After watching on blu-ray this still holds true.  The action scenes are very well done and when Obi-wan is on the screen everything in the movie sizzles.  But again due to the inevitable the Anakin side of the story suffers and it's a slog.  First and foremost Hayden does not and George Lucas messed this up to, does not know how to play the character.  The dialogue is corney but no different than any other episode.  It is just handled all wrong.  He needed to be more arrogent less bratty, (like Mark Hamil in Empire which this is supposed to mirror)So his and Padame scenes just suck.  The last part of the movie though really is great.  The Jedi get to show off and Yoda gets to really show off and it's all worth it.  Theres a neat Asteroid space fight that I really enjoy too.  Again the film looks fantastic and the sound is spectacular especially the depth charges in space.  It rattles glass real good.  The worst in the franchise but overall I can deal with it, just in spaces and time."
"Dec 21, 2011",1.5,"I Didn't think Episode 1 was all that bad, But Episode 2 is probably my least favorite out of any Star Wars Film. And I Am not 1 to Complain about the Prequels But this just didn't hold up that well. Not to mention the Fact that There were pretty good actors in this Like Christopher Lee and Samuel Jackson to name a few. But Then you have Actors Like Hayden Christensen who have characters that just Bitch throughout the whole movie. But the Battle Scenes were pretty cool, Everything else really wasn't"
"Dec 20, 2011",2.5,acting is just god awful and pityful!
"Dec 20, 2011",0.5,"It's too long, it's too dull, it's too lame."
"Dec 20, 2011",4,Its Star Wars. What can I say?
"Dec 20, 2011",4,improves upon episode 1 in a few ways.  hayden christiansen drives me crazy though.  he is terrible!
"Dec 19, 2011",2.5,"Easily the worst of all the Star Wars movies, I couldn't imagine seeing this at midnight because I would be out after the second scene."
"Dec 17, 2011",1.5,The dialogue in this is so unbelievably wooden that it's distracting. There is the occasional cool fight or battle scenes but nothing can save this script.
"Dec 17, 2011",3,"Better than the last movie, Ewan McGregor is a great actor, as is Christopher Lee, they basically hold up an otherwise terrible movie, bringing into the category of 'not that bad'... Certainly not that good either, Still lazy on the production and scripting side, and still really makes no sense."
"Dec 16, 2011",3,"How the Clone Wars began. The sequel takes place 10 years after the events of the Phantom Meneace. Obi-Wan Kenobi took Anakin as his apprentice since his master believed that he is the Chosen One. Now Anakin must protect Padme in his home planet Naboo while they are in the development of a romantic relationship. Obi-Wan must go into the planet of Kamino, which is somehow been erased from the Jedi Archives, to see the new clone army for the Republic. Who eliminated Kamino from the Jedi Archives? Who is this Count Dooku? Can Jedi withhold peace against his new threat? 
Now what's the problem with this sequel? It is way too long, so many unnecessary scenes, and if they were entertaining but no they are shallow and boring. The scenes between Anakin and Padme are the dullest boring ""romantic"" scenes I have ever seen in my life. The acting was obviously terrible; Hayden Christeen gives a dull performance as the troubled jedi. The movie was slow, I'll admit nothing was going on until the giant battle at the climax. The set designs at least they were pretty cool. The character Yoda doesn't seem all powerful since he was more or less a match against Count Dooku. It seems also a lot of things that happen that don't mean anything at the end of the movie. The film looks like a chapter of a whole other book. Also this movie seems to be a parody of the Empire Strikes Back because it has the same structure which kind of gets boring and is noticeable. 
What I enjoyed about this movie was the action sequence. I mean that lightzaber duel between Yoda and Count Dooku was freaking exhilarating. The climax of this movie is what we wanted from Star Wars, less talking and more action. Sadly there is useless dialogue that should have been taken off. At least there was less screen time for Jar Jar Binks and he have a purpose in this movie which I am freaking surprised about it. There is still one thing that bothers which is that the film takes 10 years after the first episode and it looks like Anakin grew up but Padme doesn't look a bit older. At least they had a little bit info about bounty haunting. The animation look cool at least George got that right as always. 
This is George's third Star Wars directed movie. The Academy Awards presented Attack of the Clones with a nomination for Rob Coleman, Pablo Helman, John Knoll, and Ben Snow for Best Visual Effects at the 2003 Academy Awards. Natalie Portman was also honoured at the Teen Choice Awards, and the film received an award for Best Fight at theMTV Movie Awards.In contrast, the film also received seven nominations from the Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture, Worst Director (George Lucas), Worst Screenplay(George Lucas), Worst Supporting Actor (Hayden Christensen), Worst Supporting Actress (Natalie Portman), Worst Screen Couple (Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman) and Worst Remake or Sequel.It took home two awards for Worst Screenplay (George Lucas) and Worst Supporting Actor (Hayden Christensen). The film grossed $310,676,740 in the United States and $338,721,588 overseas, a huge financial success that nevertheless was overshadowed by the even greater box-office success ofStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.[1] It was not the top U.S. grossing film of the year, the first (and only) time that a live-action Star Wars film did not have this distinction. 
I recommend this movie strictly to hard-core Star Wars since this movie only seems to be towards that audience and I consider this movie the worst of the Star Wars Saga because is boring and doesn't leave you anything memorable. I mean what the hell happened? Has George Lucas lost his touch after Indiana Jones? At least his next film is better... believe me it is so don't worry about it. For all lovers of the sci-fi genre go and watch this movie to be enjoyed."
"Dec 16, 2011",3,"Better than Phantom, and finally we see Yoda in action, but can we eject the sappy dialog?"
"Dec 15, 2011",3.5,"Well, the film corrects most errors in THE PHANTOM MENACE was but still fails to have a high level. First, the movie tends agile pace, but not cool action sequences and battles very good, with a better story and more mature than the previous film. In this issue there is the love story between Anakin and Padme, that because it is not excellent but acceptable. The performances are good and confrontations between thoughts too.
At the end of ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" corrects the mistakes of his predecessor but neglects others."
"Dec 15, 2011",2.5,This is all but not star wars once box full of magic now copy from many blocbusters
"Dec 15, 2011",4,"nice sequel to tell the story of love
best scene: the big fight"
"Dec 15, 2011",2.5,"Definitely my least favorite of the new series, this movie just felt like a mess. Too much going on, too busy and a boring story line. I was extremely disappointed by this movie."
"Dec 13, 2011",2.5,"Better than Phantom Menace, but still mediocre."
"Dec 11, 2011",5,"This movie showcases the beginning of Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side.  While some people complain about the prequels, I found them to be a fantastic expansion on the Star Wars universe.  There are some very talented actors here such as Christopher Lee, Ewan McGregor, and Ian McDiarmid.  I for one thought that Count Dooku was a much better ""bad guy"" than Darth Maul from Episode 1.  Lee brings such a sophistication to the role which makes Dooku that much cooler.  Portman once again looks amazing.  The effects are outstanding for the most part and the battle on Geonosis was awesome to watch."
"Dec 11, 2011",1.5,The overly-wordy script is so poor that this film is nearly impossible to watch.
"Dec 11, 2011",3.5,"The opening and finale of this movie are both exciting and a lot of fun. However the romance element is full of poor dialogue, isn't convincing, and is super cheesy.  It isn't executed in a believable way and tends to make you roll your eyes more than anything else. The movie slightly surpasses its predecessor but is nowhere near the quality of the rest of the series. It's a watchable movie with some satisfying action scenes but it's never a great one. I have fun watching it, but it fails to stand out as anything special."
"Dec 11, 2011",4,I think this one has the best action!
"Dec 11, 2011",4.5,This film is better than the 1st one. The love between Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala is so cute and lovely... hahaha.. And the war of the Clones is pretty exciting... Ah! Master Yoda fighting? that was really surprising too! but I have a doubt about this movie.. doesn't  Padme Amidala get old? hahahaha is she a human being???
"Dec 10, 2011",0.5,"this one makes me cry.......
it was that bad"
"Dec 10, 2011",0.5,Its even worst than episode I.
"Dec 10, 2011",3.5,"I'll preface this by saying I'm a huge SW fan so all 6 of the movies are on my favorites list.  That being said, this one gets the lowest rating because I find it the least rewatchable of the 3.  I'll take Jar Jar's antics to Padme/Anakin dialogue anyday."
"Dec 08, 2011",2.5,"Even though there are some great scenes, I still cry myself to sleep thinking about the movie as a whole."
"Dec 08, 2011",2,"One of the biggest let downs, Attack of the Clones is not only a movie with mediocre acting and a boring story, but also is the worst Star Wars."
"Dec 08, 2011",2.5,WTF? Could've been an hour long
"Dec 07, 2011",3.5,"Just like its predecessor, ""Attack of the Clones"" features some truly dazzling moments, but some story elements come up short, such as the Anakin/Padme romantic sub-plot."
"Dec 07, 2011",2.5,This one must be the worst of them all. That silly Jar Jar Binks is just ruining the entire movie.
"Dec 06, 2011",3,"Hayden Christensen. I'm sick of the guy.
As for the action, definitely one of the best in the entire saga but the acting is seriously lacking. The worst, plot-wise, than any other Star Wars movie."
"Dec 05, 2011",3.5,"At times, it feels like it's trying too hard. At times it feels like it was written by a 12-year old (especially the love scenes). But all in all, it's a fun ride, and a vast improvement over the previous movie."
"Dec 05, 2011",2.5,"Worst Star Wars film, EVER! And the only one that I gave rotten. I had watched most Star Wars films a long time ago, and this is the only one that I couldn't remember a single good thing about it. I prefer... any other sci-fi!"
"Dec 04, 2011",4,Much better than TPM. I think each one gets better. The romance of Anakin &amp; Padme is beautiful but kind of odd because she's much older than him.
"Dec 04, 2011",1,"It gets worse and worse and worse than the previous boring prequel. Horrible dialogue delivered by oscar winning actors is absolutely painful. Sterile set pieces, and cheap C.G.I make the action short of tension and this movie concludes to being a ""Load'a Crap"""
"Dec 04, 2011",3,"Better than its predecessor but still not without flaws. Lucas didn't learn from his mistake. Young Anakin was a bad actor in EP 1, and now adult Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is just as shitty. Well, at least he is consistent. Lucas seems to think that Darth vader used to be a whiny bitch before turning to the dark side. And a badly written script didn't help Hayden either or any of the other cast members for that matter. Anakin and Padme's supposedly romantic dialogues were awkward and cringe-worthy at best. Eventually, we are forced to wait for another episode for the full transformation of Jedi Anakin to Sith Vader."
"Dec 03, 2011",0.5,The worst of the series.
"Dec 03, 2011",3.5,"Some really great action sequences early on, followed by a couple of giant ho-hum battle sequences and an unsatisfying ending.  Interweaved throughout is the cheesiest love story ever told.  ""I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.""  Please."
"Dec 03, 2011",4,nice sequel to star wars...with good affects that people love...
"Dec 03, 2011",3.5,"Of course, this is at our local library."
"Dec 02, 2011",2,"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is in my opinion, the worst film of the franchise.  It goes even deeper into the problems that The Phantom Menace had, leaving me severely disappointed.  The special effects for several scenes feel just silly and sloppy.  The villain isn't that interesting and proves Darth Maul should have stuck around longer.  Hayden Christensen gives one of the most shameful performances I can think of as Anakin Skywalker, but I blame this on George Lucas for his poor casting choice and bad writing.  His romance with Natalie Portman just feels forced and uncomfortable.  Also, I won't ever understand why they brought back Jar Jar Binks, even if it was only a few scenes.  I will give props to the films for doing a few things right.  Ewan McGregor is still fantastic as Obi-Wan.  Some of the action scenes are cool. John Williams score is still pitch perfect.  Attack of the Clones has a few things going for it, but overall it just feels like a waste of film that it only further proved why the prequels pale in comparison to the original trilogy."
"Dec 02, 2011",2.5,Disapointments abound as Episode two was worse than episode one.  Hayden Christenson needs acting lessons!
"Dec 01, 2011",5,actually may favorite one of the new trilogy. i think hayden christiansen was graet but ppl just misunderstood his charachter
"Dec 01, 2011",1,"Bad effects and script, but I like Star Wars just not this... speaking of a hero falling from grace over time."
"Nov 29, 2011",3,"An enjoyable, yet more cartoonish and kid-friendly ""Star Wars"" film. Christopher Lee was great in this movie."
"Nov 28, 2011",2.5,"An improvement over Episode I indeed, but still disappointing in some parts. Let RedLetterMedia explain the rest."
"Nov 28, 2011",3.5,"While some of the acting could use a refresher, Lucas does a solid job of expanding the new trilogy and sticking to the character development that makes this prequel somewhat relevant."
"Nov 27, 2011",3,"a nice try, continues the story, but falls short in many ways. the lack of real sets and the switch to digital make this one seem too fake, though some of the action scenes are pretty neat and the music is beautiful in some areas."
"Nov 27, 2011",4,Made up in terms of the first one ALOT! I like the apperance of Count Dooku and the little hints of whats to come as seen in the Death Star plans. I like the huge Jedi battle at the end too.
"Nov 27, 2011",3,"A nice second attempt in the Star Wars prequel trilogy.

The plot is a bit more interesting and has some passable acting. The romance between Anakin and Padme will make you feel sick. A fully animated Yoda adds to the visual factor and the climax has more explosions than a Michael Bay film.

It could have been worse."
"Nov 26, 2011",1.5,better than the driveled garbage that was episode 1.
"Nov 26, 2011",2,"More fun, more witty, and a completely animated Yoda adds to the awesome factor in this second installment of the threequel series of Star Wars. Lucas obviously took a hint from the audience that his plot development had been, well, next to nothing. Although somewhat still rickety in its transition, the improved graphics and characters' conflicts make it an improvement over the first dry installment."
"Nov 26, 2011",5,"This film is great, and it ends perfectly. It sets everything up for the final part of the second prequel to this fantastic trilogy.

Hayden Christensen's (Anakin) acting was so scripted, but he is a convincing Anakin driven by love and morals, but acts rashly and is seduced by power. 

Natlie Portman's (Padame) acting was decent it played off well alongside Christensen's."
"Nov 25, 2011",2,"An Improvement? Jesus, Rotten Tomatoes...Attack of the Clones was a waste of time and money. I don't see how its and improvement."
"Nov 24, 2011",4.5,My fifth favorite Star Wars film. The screenplay is very poor including the performances of Natalie Portman and Heiden Christenesen. But the action sequences are chilling.
"Nov 24, 2011",4,Attack Of The Clones is huge and bring the magic of the franchise back. The best of the second trilogy.
"Nov 22, 2011",4,"I don't know about everyone else but I really liked this film. I think people take the acting too seriously in the prequels when its supposed to be cheesy and bad like old Flash Gordon serials but that evidence never seems to click to anyone but me. Maybe its because I don't take Star Wars so seriously and can see what George Lucas is trying to do. But anyway what I really liked was the world building and the continuation of Anakin's character arc from Phantom Menace. John Williams' score is the best in this installment of the saga and helps you buy Anakin and Padme falling in love. The lightsaber battle at the end is kind of meh but thankfully is saved by Yoda. Anyway, I found enough to enjoy from Attack of the Clones, its not perfect but its far from being as bad as some would believe."
"Nov 21, 2011",4,Darker and edgier of the Prequels.
"Nov 20, 2011",3,epic fight between the jedi and droids
"Nov 20, 2011",1.5,This film really brought out the Star Wars hater in me.
"Nov 19, 2011",2,Blah....boring and unnecessary.
"Nov 19, 2011",3,"Very flabby at 2.5 hrs with a naff romantic sub plot dragging it out. However, a visual feast and the battle scenes are great."
"Nov 18, 2011",4,80% good but not brilliant
"Nov 17, 2011",1.5,"technically awful in almost every way, the only thing that saves this disaster is the special effects - and even then, it's like bailing out the Titanic"
"Nov 16, 2011",3,"The ""I slaughtered them"" scene with Hayden Christiansen was possibly the most awkward moment in cinematic history."
"Nov 16, 2011",5,"Despite the prequels' bad raps, this is an excellent movie.  Best of the prequels."
"Nov 16, 2011",4,"George Lucas strikes back with Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. The Force is indeed strong with this one; light years ahead of his predecessor, Attack of the Clones is an underappreciated cinematic experience that combines a great mix of action and romance. Featuring a masterful performance from Ewan McGregor that oozes wisdom and integrity as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Attack of the Clones is a beautifully stunning and visually dazzling movie."
"Nov 15, 2011",4,Jango Fett made this movie. It is a good filler for the story.
"Nov 15, 2011",4.5,Stronger outing for the prequel trilogy. A little darker than the kid friendly episode one. Just like most Star Wars films some great action set peices make this more than worth your time. The Yoda scene brought down the house.
"Nov 15, 2011",2,"Try to make up for underusing the very popular boba fett character by using Jango Fett, his father, but the movie still sucks, mainly I think because of one name: Hayden Christensen"
"Nov 14, 2011",2.5,"Like Episode 1, this episode is also a failure, most lame plot, CHristensen's acting was unimpressive, the love story was a total mess and dragged horribly."
"Nov 14, 2011",5,What Can One Say About the Greatest Science Fiction Saga Ever Made; Awsome
"Nov 14, 2011",4,"It begins to touch on the future, but the central part of the plot is largely ignored in favor of an underdeveloped Skywalker."
"Nov 12, 2011",2,Much like the same thing as Episode 5.
"Nov 12, 2011",3.5,"I major improvement over Phantom, but still feels very unexciting."
"Nov 11, 2011",3.5,"Everything ties up, and it makes you like WOAH!"
"Nov 11, 2011",5,The Clones were AWSOME!
"Nov 09, 2011",3.5,"What a huge improvement over the previous film, and much better than that horrible Phantom Menace, this is the chapter in which we finally receive tie-ins with the original trilogy, although they don't show it eye-wise, but we do learn about how the biggest enemy in the Star Wars trilogy will be formed, and it leaves us uneasy when episode iii comes, knowing what will happen. However, i didn't think it was the best of them all, i thought the story took too much time to tell, but i am glad it's better than the Phantom Menace."
"Nov 09, 2011",3,"Clumsy, clunky, full of unbearably wooden and embarrassing acting, dialouge and genrall line delivery, especialy from the useless hayden christensen (really after auditoining thousands, this plank was the best?) and pften it looks like one giant fucking video game, and the less said about the frolicking on naboo the better, i mean really the whole coversation about sand?! the rollling around on the field, has george lucas ever actually met another human being? is he a socail retard? people do not talk or act like this, i dont care what galaxy (far far away) their from. But clones (worst title ever!) cotains some absolutely awesome scenes that stir the blood and wipe away all the bad stuff at least until after it's finished ( like the scene where anakin goes apeshit on the sand people or the last 40 mins) oh and boba fett is a little cunt, guess what you lairy little shit you get uncerimoniously eaten by a big sand anus when you grow up!"
"Nov 09, 2011",0.5,"""Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is."""
"Nov 04, 2011",3.5,"Not as great as it could've been, but Attack of the Clones is still an enjoyable movie with great action and only drags a little, but it overall improves upon Phantom Menace. It also includes more of the fun Star Wars humour of the original trilogy, rather than the stupid slapstick stuff of which Phantom Menace included too much of."
"Nov 04, 2011",3.5,"A romantic improvement over ""PHANTOM MENACE"", but still an OK film in an originally classic saga."
"Nov 01, 2011",3,Nowhere near as good as the original trilogy that changed blockbuster cinema forever but a definete improvement to the Phantom Menace.
"Oct 30, 2011",5,the best of the whole prequel series which was overall disappointing
"Oct 29, 2011",1.5,Hayden Christensen does a good job of making Anakin the whiniest most annoying character in movie history.
"Oct 28, 2011",1.5,Que gusto de hacerles decir estupideces a los personajes.
"Oct 27, 2011",5,Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's chemistry lives up to the movie. This movie brings more action and more fight scenes to the screen.
"Oct 27, 2011",3,Great special effects overshadow poor acting
"Oct 26, 2011",3.5,"Not the best of the series, but it  does not deserve jacks*** for being nominated for Worst Film at the Razzies."
"Oct 24, 2011",2,How can you enjoy a movie when you know exactly how it all ends. That is why I thought doing Episodes 1-3 was just stupid. If he had to make more money then make 7-9 so that those of use who have not read the books will not know whats going to happen.
"Oct 24, 2011",3.5,"DespuÃ (C)s de la falta de hervor de La Amenaza Fantasma, en el Episodio II los ingredientes comenzaron a hacer chup-chup. El tono infantiloide (familiar, si lo preferÃ­s) deja paso al Lado Oscuro, cosa que ya supone una mejora de entrada. Seguramente escaldado por las crÃ­ticas, Lucas marginÃ³ a un papel testimonial (pero irÃ³nicamente crucial para el argumento) al odiado Jar-Jar Binks. Y el cargante niÃ±o Annie aparece aquÃ­ crecidito, con lo que el efecto Disney queda diluÃ­do. La indigestiÃ³n provocada por el pequeÃ±o Annakin se sustituye por el romance entre el Annakin post-adolescente y la excelsa Senadora Amidala. Sea por falta de quÃ­mica, por la sobredosis de almÃ­bar en el guiÃ³n o por la insuficiencia interpretativa de Hayden Christensen (que se maneja mucho mejor en el difÃ­cil reto de mostrar la mala leche contenida del futuro Vader), la historia de amor se convierte en el talÃ³n de Aquiles (junto a los irritantes movimientos digitales) de una pelÃ­cula que, por lo demÃ¡s, aÃ±ade un catÃ¡logo de atractivos innegables a la saga: de nuevo las necesarias y celebradas referencias a sus pelÃ­culas hermanas (primera intervenciÃ³n del duo R2D2/C3PO !), los homenajes al cine de John Ford o Ray Harryhausen, a Blade Runner, a la arquitectura de GaudÃ­. La apariciÃ³n de Christopher Lee, de la Academia Jedi y de los Troopers,  la sofisticaciÃ³n de Kamino, el inevitable duelo de sables lÃ¡ser, la Ã (C)pica batalla final...Son muchos puntos a favor, a pesar de que pienso (sinceramente) que a los personajes  les falta el carisma de la vieja pandilla. En cualquier caso, El Ataque de los Clones es un espectÃ¡culo que mejora a medida que avanzan los minutos, que deja con ganas de ver el Episodio III y cerrar el cÃ­rculo mÃ¡s de 20 aÃ±os despuÃ (C)s."
"Oct 23, 2011",3.5,"Rating: 81/100 B- Attack Of The Clones could've been avoided. I would of much rather had an extended Phantom Menace and Revenge Of The Sith than Attack Of The Clones. It seems dragged out, and hardly fills any of the story of the original trilogy. and if I had a least favorite I guess it would be this one, but its still a great film."
"Oct 23, 2011",3,It's almost as if Lucas tries to make good actors do things poorly sometimes.
"Oct 21, 2011",3,"Average. Not awful. Anikans hot, that's a plus :)"
"Oct 21, 2011",3.5,"Good in terms of action, but not so great of an acting.  It is, however, the most complete and the most developed of the prequels."
"Oct 21, 2011",3,"The plot may be a bit too political for an epic Sci-Fi film, and especially for a Star Wars film, but this installment is strangely one of the most enjoyable ones and has some strong character development to match, not to mention the fact it's more intelligent than its predecessor."
"Oct 21, 2011",1,just stick to the original series
"Oct 20, 2011",2,"Although not as flawed as the first one, in many ways even more disappointing.  With all the rampant juvenlia of the first one stripped away, there is just a big empty core left."
"Oct 19, 2011",2,"Hayden Christianson is a terrible lead, the whole light-saber thing becomes redundant with the climax, we know what to expect, and it fails to deliver, Christopher Lee's built in Awesomeness can't save it either, just like Ray Park."
"Oct 19, 2011",1.5,"You'd think Lucas might have learned from his last big mistake (phantom menace) but actually this one is actually worse! Once again very unmemorable, incomprehensible plot and boring characters. Cliched romance and dialog. ALL shot on a green screen. Stupid. NOT Star Wars. 
1.5/5"
"Oct 19, 2011",1.5,"Honestly the worst Star Wars. The entire piece is butchered by the presence of Christensen and Portman together, loaded with their cheesy love dialogue"
"Oct 18, 2011",0.5,I'm not even going to comment on this time-waster.
"Oct 16, 2011",4,"Definitely the worst of all six films. There are a ton of gag-worthy lines between Anakin and Padme, Anakin himself is an arrogant brat and has none of the original charm of the little nine year old in ""The Phantom Menace"", and Obi Wan annoys me to no end. And yet, despite all this, the movie still manages to offer purely awesome fight scenes and plenty of wonderful lines. This along with George Lucas's legendary story-telling makes for a nice sequel...if you can overlook the terribly annoying main characters."
"Oct 15, 2011",3.5,"After recently watching it again, I realized the brilliance of George Lucas' story is enough to make up for sections of lacking screenplay."
"Oct 14, 2011",3.5,PodÃ­a decirse que es la mas fuerte en efectos y calidad visual por lo que se ve impresionante en HD. Nunca olvidare el WOW de ver. Yoda pelear por primera vez
"Oct 09, 2011",3.5,"my least favorite out of the newest trilogy, but still very good!"
"Oct 08, 2011",3.5,I loved the movie but Hayden Christensen acting was bad in this movie. I liked in Episode 3 because he brought on the anger just right.
"Oct 07, 2011",1.5,"Geaorge Lucas has this film full of problems that he created for himself. Charactrers that are psychologically inaccurate or uninteresting, huge wars that are created from thin air and which are supposed to be feel big and important.

Esthetically I feel Attack of Clones is more pleasing to eye then Phantom Menace - the inconsistency in esthetics is different. The duo between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman might be psychologically inaccurratte but still there are few entertaining moments. Especially when Padame decides to go to save Obi-Wan.

The story saga takes some inaccurate steps but still gets going and at the beginning of the movie especially I feel the balance between saga and action is correct. Even dialogue is flawed the trash talk between Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen is also quite entertaining at times."
"Oct 07, 2011",3.5,"Hyden sucks big time as Anakin,bit the movie is damn good."
"Oct 06, 2011",2.5,Half of this is a full-throttle awesome action ride. The OTHER half is the worst love story put on film.
"Oct 05, 2011",3.5,"An improvement, the cant be much more to say about this film. As a fan of the star wars franchise, i have one thing to say about this film, boring. The visual effects are stunning, but the long run-time and the cheesy romance this film is lacking in what made the original Star Wars movies great. A great light saber duel at the end between Christoper Lee (Count Dooku) and Master Yoda makes this film worth watching."
"Oct 04, 2011",3,"No matter how many times I've watched this movie, I'm sorry to say that this was worse than The Phantom Menace. It moved a little too slow and only the action sequences kept me awake. Though I do love quoting the dialogue word for word in the last 30 minutes of the movie, I still say  they should've found a better actor than Hayden Christensen."
"Oct 03, 2011",4,"I like Star Wars.. So, I'm kinda biased."
"Oct 03, 2011",3.5,"Even though Anakin is a crybaby, this installment has better action, better performances, and a much more interesting plot than its predecessor."
"Oct 02, 2011",1.5,"'Attack of the Clones' is my less favorite out of the entire series.   Even the title is stupid!    Not only did Lucas get carried away with the CGI fluff, but also he got carried away with the digital filmmaking.  And as a result, this film is cluttered.  It's film noir, it's a love story, and by the end of it - it is 'Empire Strikes Back,' part II!   

Even though 'Menace' is not a GREAT film by any means, it was a different kind of Star Wars.  It felt familiar, but it was different.  It was kiddy, but it was fun.   'Clones,' much like 'Empire' is darker than its predecessor is - but the biggest issue is it is also very much like 'Empire,' but feels more like a parody.   As a matter of fact, it's hard to look at any of these prequels and not think of the many 'Robot Chicken' jabs!    

The Blu Ray, much like the movie, is mixed with some beautiful sequences, cluttered with mediocre ones.   If there is one improvement Blu Rays need to make, it's being able to have dark scenes clear.   The lighter the texture, the better it looks.  The darker the texture, the resolution is as horrid as George Lucas's craft at writing dialogue!   

Unlike most people, I don't mind Hayden Christensen.  I think he is a capable actor (look at 'Life as a House' and 'Shattered Glass').  So his presence isn't as bad as what people proclaim.  To me, it's always the writing.  And the writing in this movie is BAD!   The romance lacked chemistry, and despite Portman's hotness(!), even she couldn't save the movie.   

Then again, we are talking about a film series that is inspired by film serials.  Maybe the intention was for this to be not-so-good.   On the other hand, what made 'Empire' and 'Jedi' good films - Lucas had helped with the script(s) and had a different director with each film, making them feel different.   I wonder where the potential of these films would have gone to (good or bad) without too much Lucas."
"Oct 01, 2011",2,Dreadful dialogue between Anakin and Padme give their romance about as much heat as a winter day in Boston.
"Oct 01, 2011",4,"A movie that goes more into depth with its characters yet still feel like its missing its soul, it fixes a lot of holes from its predecesor"
"Oct 01, 2011",4.5,"Attack of th clones it´s better than the Phantom menace, but despite the great CGI, the action scenes, and the hot Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen comes to fuck the movie, it should have had more chemistry between Padme and Anakin and better performances. On the good things of the movie: well, Jango Fett is a cool villain, the fight between Yoda and Dracul... I mean Dooku, it´s one of the best fights from the saga."
"Oct 01, 2011",2.5,"No movie showcases George Lucas' fatal flaw of excess more than Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.  At this point in his filmmaking career, Lucas has become so enamored with digitally created settings and characters, that the film loses any feeling of humanity it might have otherwise had.  Watching characters interact with each other, there's no getting around the distraction that you're watching basically a big screen video game.  The entire production just feels...sterile.

This being the middle chapter of the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy, we more or less know what's going to happen.  Anakin Sywalker (Hayden Christensen) will inch ever closer to embracing the dark side of The Force and strengthen his romance with Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman).  It's lucky for the viewer that we already know about this romance, because Christensen and Portman have about as much on-screen chemistry as prison cellmates.  They aren't helped much with clunky dialogue, and feeble attempts at poetic grandeur.  Nowhere is this more obvious than when Skywalker woos Amidala with the line, ""I don't like sand.  It's course and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere.  You're not like sand.""  Yes, this line was meant to be taken seriously.

Perhaps a stronger actor could have pulled it off, but Christensen is obviously out of his league here.  He basically only has three emotions in the movie; anger, petulant whining, and a blank stare.  His delivery of lines is wooden, making the poor writing all that more obvious.  Not at any point in the movie do you feel like this is the towering and menacing figure to come in the original Star Wars saga.  Portman isn't much better, however.  Normally an incredbily gifted actress, she too seems to be sleepwalking through this picture.  Not that I blame her.  It nearly put me to sleep myself.

We do get to see a much anticipated light-saber battle featuring Yoda, that's well worth the wait.  Ewan McGregor continues his evolution into a young Sir Alec Guiness that's highly enjoyable to watch.  And the John Williams score is like slipping into a pair of well-worn pajamas.  Still, these hilights can't overcome a plodding script.  If there's one cardinal sin that ""Attack of the Clones"" commits, is that for an action movie...it's awful boring."
"Oct 01, 2011",3,"My revisiting the entire Star Wars saga on blu ray continues with Episode II, which is actually better than the dreadful Episode I in almost every way (not saying much obviously), save character development. Having Hayden Christensen whine the whole movie (reminiscent of Mark Whalberg in The Happening) in simplistic childish monologues doesn't equal development (learn the art of subtlety Lucas). But there is a semblance of a plot, and the acting overall is stronger, especially form McGregor."
"Sep 28, 2011",3,"The weakest of all the Star Wars films by some margin. Hayden Christianson's awful Anakin Skywalker and scene after scene of him being all in love with Padme or emoting furiously with a furrowed brow couldn't be much more tedious (""I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating, hoping that that kiss will not become a scar."") Haunting indeed.

Overall the film isn't as bad as its weakest links. It's watchable and it moves the story along fine. The clone army is an interesting concept and once again the visuals are flawless. I just don't ever want to watch it again."
"Sep 26, 2011",2,The worst Star Wars film.
"Sep 26, 2011",3,"Entertaining while Obi Wan treks around the galaxy, but is downright dull during the scenes with Anakin and Padme. (Once again, amateur acting.) The last half hour is truly spectacular though"
"Sep 26, 2011",4,Android  acting Hayden Christensen ruined this film for me.
"Sep 26, 2011",3,"Breath-taking visuals but in every way, fails to surpass the original trilogy. Though Attack Of The Clones is better than Phantom Manace, the characters still lack chemistry and charisma. It doesn't look like a prequel in a bad way. However, on a good light Yoda finally steals the show."
"Sep 26, 2011",2.5,Saw it on blu ray. Treads water a bit.
"Sep 25, 2011",2.5,"Easily the worst of the Star Wars films, Clones doesn't find a proper way to blend a love story in a war movie."
"Sep 25, 2011",3,"My second favorite of the prequel's, This movie is fun, entertaining, and paves the way for The Clone Wars television show. The romance between Anakin and Padme is necessary, but not so much of it. Without them we couldn't have Luke and Leia, but we don't need so much."
"Sep 25, 2011",3,less boring and more energetic than the last one but the development and performance of anakin is simply pathetic to say the least
"Sep 24, 2011",2.5,"Star Wars Episode II Attack Of The Clones is the worst film out of all six of them. Lucas decides to make this film worse than Phantom Menace by turning Star Wars into a forced love story between Anakin and Padme, For 2 hours. We get little clips here and there of Obi-Wan trying to recruit the clones and even meeting Jango Fett. This film does not have much action at all until the very end, the ending is very cool and makes you go ""wow!"" Cause you get to see so many Jedi's fight and we've never seen that before, but besides that we get a 2 minute action scene now and again but nothing great and the forced love story makes it very hard to watch without feeling awkward, almost as bad as Twilights love story. In the end this movie is boring and it's not very re watchable unless you wanna watch the awesome like 20 minutes of the movie that'll make you smile. Seems like Lucas got better at action but worse on story telling."
"Sep 24, 2011",3.5,The plot thickens and the story goes darker but the development of Anakin is just pathetic. It should have been more Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins/Dark Knight)  kind of dark instead. His entire play and dialogue really brings it down.
"Sep 24, 2011",3,"An improvement but still no good, I don't understand how they make the main character as annoying as he is and it has more than 5 minutes of awesomeness this time round and it's actually good."
"Sep 23, 2011",0.5,By far the worst star wars movie made. Just plain silly and stupid script amplified by the terrible acting provided by Hayden Christensen.
"Sep 23, 2011",2.5,"Big improvement over Phantom but let down by forced humour, terrible romance scenes and Hayden Christensen's awful awful acting... The film does have some decent moments though."
"Sep 21, 2011",3,"3: This will be a combined review of all 6 films in the series.  It's obvious right from the start that this is going to be something special: the booming score along with the words Star Wars, then comes Episode IV along with the unforgettable scrolling script.  To start with Episode IV is critical, as it adds that little bit extra to help the film capture the serial-quality that Lucas was going for.  He has taken the B or C picture/show and made it an epic of myth and magic.  It was magic for me as child as well, as Star Wars was one the films I would watch virtually every time I was sick (it was one of the few we had recorded or purchased on VHS along with Swiss Family Robinson, Disney's Robin Hood, and Ben-Hur).  Thus, it is one of the few films that most shaped my early experiences with the medium.  It's the kind of tale and experience that is powerful whether one is a young boy or an old man (I suspect at least).  It has never been a more visceral experience than on Blu-Ray with D-Box.  It truly looks and feels wonderful.  There is no doubt about it for me: George Lucas and John Williams make a great team and have a certain indefinable power.  Lucas definitely picked the right composer and Williams once again managed to be an integral part of what makes a film larger than life (as he did with Indiana Jones as well).  The score is simply inseparable from the film as a whole, as are the sound effects of course.  Rarely has commercial entertainment been this satisfying.  There is a certain operatic nature present in all six that one rarely finds in film.  I think it has something to do with Lucas' connection with Joseph Campbell and the nature of mythology.  I think one of the key scenes in the entire series comes in Episode 6 when C3PO is recounting the tale of Episodes 4-6 to the Ewoks around a campfire.  This is what mythology is all about.  Lucas has simply taken it to another level and placed it in a different format (film-based, as opposed to written poetry/prose or the spoken word).  These are immeasurably powerful and entertaining films.  I've always had a certain fascination with the darker side of humanity, whether it be manifested in Sauron, serial killers, or Vader. It's a fascination with power, which they all have in abundance.  The best film is obviously the first, but Episodes 5 and 6 certainly hold their own quite well.  There are few series/franchises that one can say the same about (Christopher Nolan's Batman pictures, The Godfather series, the James Bond franchise, etc).  More than any of the newer three films, I find Episode 3 to be very underrated, larger because of it's focus on the dark side and how one can be corrupted and turned.  I think their stature of all three films will grow with time, although they obviously do not measure up to the originals.  McDiarmid is spectacular in Episode 3, as he was in all four pictures in which he appeared.  While the original trilogy is basically perfectly casted and acted, the latest three pictures are not quite as top-notch.  Christensen is uneven, Jar Jar Binks is awful, McGregor and Neeson are adequate, and Portman's smile is unforgettable, even if her performance isn't.  The character actors in the original trilogy really helped push it over the edge.  each of the Imperial officers is perfect, as are the back up characters.  They aren't as good as the Coen Brothers, but they are certainly memorable.  The action and pace in the new pictures is ramped up a bit too much at times, but this is simply in keeping with the vast majority of major Hollywood productions.  I do wish Lucas had gotten a bit more help from other screenwriters though as some of his dialogue is atrocious (especially in Episode 2).  He didn't have this problem in the past either, so it's either something he's lost or something he's changed.  I can somewhat forgive him simply because he is reaching for epic, operatic, and larger-than-life.  I love the gloss and sheen of Lucas' digital pictures as well.  His sets, because they aren't really there, have an otherworldly and perfect quality that is unmatched.  In the end, it comes down to the little character, set. location, technology, story details that fill out the pictures and make this a world to revel in.  It isn't as complete as Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but it can be favorably/reasonably compared to it and other universes of the imagination like Asimov's or Rowling's.  Anyone that does not appreciate these films does not appreciate Hollywood or the civilizations upon which we are founded."
"Sep 21, 2011",4,My 2nd favorite Star Wars movie.
"Sep 19, 2011",5,"Love it!!! Just like the 5 others. Star wars has every thing from great battles, romance, cheesy characters, and just all around awesome. Hayden Christensen did a perfect job portraying teenaged little whiny Anakin. If you've never seen Star Wars you must watch any of them. Star Wars might not be your cup of tea and I'm fine with that but it's definitely mine."
"Sep 19, 2011",2,Iâ(TM)ve seen childrenâ(TM)s daytime tv shows that did a better job of convincing me that two characters just fell in love. And I was more entertained.
"Sep 19, 2011",3,"3 - An exciting, lengthy climatic sequence that kicks off the fabled Clone Wars finally arrives after overlong, dare I say boring, expository plot. This plot would have been fine content wise had it not been written so clumsily. Politics can get away with poor dialogue in sci-fi, but not so romance. In fact, the blossoming romance between Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen in variable performance) and Padme (Natalie Portman, doing well with what she's given) has to be one of the most poorly written in the history of cinema, and it does unfortunately take much screen time. But for every defect there is also something good, such as classy Christopher Lee as the ominous villain, Count Dooku; Yoda finally seen in sword-fighting action,; and bringing back C3P0 as comic relief, whilst Jar Jar Binks is thankfully kept in the background. John Williams score also has moments that capture greatness."
"Sep 18, 2011",5,"Like the rest of them, I loved this movie as well. A lot of cynics hate on Hayden Christensen as Anakin but I think he does a great job here. Can't wait to finish rewatching the Saga in 1080p."
"Sep 18, 2011",3,"The saga continues and starts pretty well even with the mighty talent that is Hayden Christensen (!!!) The plotline with Anakin and Padme is painful to watch at times and this is not helped by Mr Christensen's awful acting. The rest of the story is fine and it's good to see Yoda finally doing his stuff towards the end. Ian McDiarmid is as good as ever and it's good Christopher Lee aswell. An improvement on Phantom Menace (mainly because the awful Jar Jar Binks takes a back seat, but does turn up from time to time), but still a long way behind Episodes IV, V and VI."
"Sep 18, 2011",4,"lots of great effects &amp; action. the asteroid chase scene is 1 of the best ""car chase"" scenes ever."
"Sep 17, 2011",4,I actually really enjoyed this one
"Sep 17, 2011",1.5,"""Sometimes there are things no one can fix."""
"Sep 17, 2011",3.5,"A lot better than Phantom Menace. The dialogue was a lot less cheesy and the story all the more engrossing. Hayden Christensen is okay at playing Anakin when he's angry, but every other time feels extremely wooden and not at all likable (but maybe that's the point). Special effects still hold up great, no great difference from Phantom, and looks excellent on Blu-Ray. The highlight of the movie: the Yoda fight of course!"
"Sep 16, 2011",4.5,"Excellent, plenty of Fett, lots of fun and adventure."
"Sep 16, 2011",4.5,Not as big a fan of the prequels but it still hits the spot.
"Sep 16, 2011",3,"In hopes that Attack of the Clones would finally get into the ""meat"" of the prequels, as it were, we're instead left with a juvenile mystery and a love story that turns into a cheesy bore-fest.  The only bits of real interest are delivered in the very beginning and the end, leaving this Star Wars entry as the worst, easily.  C'mon, search your feelings, you know it to be true.

The obvious flaw here is Hayden Christensen.  He doesn't work.  Harrison Ford will be the first to tell you that, ""You can write this shit, but you can't say it!"" But at least he made it believable!  So does Ewan McGregor (reprising Obi-Wan) and Natalie Portman for the most part.  Hayden . . . no.  Not even close.  It doesn't help that there's some horribly written dialogue here, but Hayden is about as wooden as they come.  There is zero chemistry between him and Natalie Portman, and automatically that means that half the movie fails, and we're left with a lead character about as charismatic as a CG Clone trooper.

I remember that this was the first SW flick I saw, where I was unsure how to feel about it.  It's entertaining, sure, but it lives in that camp of Mystery Science Theater fame.  There's some very cool action scenes, but you'll be laughing at every other bit of dialogue that comes out of these people's mouths.  And the lightsaber duel at the end?  Short and boring, like the range of Hayden Christensen's acting.

Even though Jake Lloyd sucked the big one in Episode I, there was at least something poetic about his clueless character.  ""I don't want things to change,"" he would say to his mother.  The very nature of his undoing.  You know Hayden's acting is bad when he makes me appreciate Jake Lloyd!  Hayden takes Anakin's tragic character and turns him into a whiny bitch.  I suppose Hayden looks the part at least, and is believable with a lightsaber.  And don't get me started on all the tracked music thrown about here . . . (look it up if you don't know).

I could go on, but why bother?  Attack of the Clones is a disappointing Star Wars movie, but it does manage to move things along from point A (Episode I) to point B (a much more interesting Episode III) and deliver the entertainment goods.  Unfortunately, it delivers a lot of the type of entertainment I wasn't hoping to find in a SW flick; unintentional humor.  But what's done is done.  All I can say is go into this movie without the expectations, and you should enjoy it."
"Sep 16, 2011",0.5,"Viewers walked into theaters saying, ""it has to be better than the Phantom Menace,"" only to walk out confused, doubting their own judgement and world view. This movie is terrible. Two Girls One Cup is a better film, from a plot perspective."
"Sep 16, 2011",3.5,The worst of the star wars series. It doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the movies. Its fun to watch at first but you eventually get bored of it.
"Sep 15, 2011",2.5,"Sabre duels and wars are fun and plenty entertaiment, but Attack of the Clones suffers of the touch from the original trilogy and has some unnecessary sub-plots."

"Sep 15, 2011",2,Least Fav Star Wars Movie
"Sep 14, 2011",4,"A better film then The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones is a return to form for the series. While it has its moments of weak dialogue and some dated effects by today's standard, the film is thoroughly absorbing and the 143 minute running time flies by. While there are some scenes that are overly fleshed out and explained in tedious detail, the abundance of action in this film helps keep it moving forward and maintains a balance.  The Blu-ray upgrade is a major one and breaths new life into the franchise and makes for a wonderful release along with the rest of the Star Wars saga.  It sets the stage for Revenge of the Sith to tie the two trilogies together into one seamless saga!"
"Sep 13, 2011",0.5,Did Lucas even know what he was doing?
"Sep 13, 2011",2,"Rent-it on Blu-ray - Though these three films actually look and sound better than the original trilogy in HD, the story is lacking (besides nicely tying up loose ends between 3 and 4) and the acting is supremely sub-par. But I did camp out overnight to see the Revenge of the Sith premiere so who am I to judge.

"Sep 12, 2011",2.5,"The Star Wars franchise worsened itself with a pitiful return to it's roots, but forgot that story is the most important part."
"Sep 12, 2011",4.5,"What can I say about this movie that it hasn't been said before.... Everybody knows that maybe this is the most succesful franchise in the history of Hollywood; though not all the movies are equally good most of them are great, except maybe""The Phantom menace"". The Attack of the clones is great because introduce many things that we took for granted in the Luke Skywalker trilogy, for example the clones, the friendship between C3PO and R2D2; Yoda's skills with the lightsaber; Bobba Fett origins; and many other things. Everything in the Star Wars franchise is great and this one is not the exception. Really great movie...."
"Sep 11, 2011",4.5,"This film is really where the relative storyline of Star Wars comes alive. The plot thickens as we start to care for the characters and begin to see correlations between this and the original trilogy. The world of Star Wars really does become more evident and stronger through this film. Need I mention that the effects are amazing and well, it's Star Wars, so I love it."
"Sep 10, 2011",1.5,"Episode II. There was a big opportunity here to save the Star Wars franchise. After the fall from grace that was Episode I, you'd expect George Lucas and his cohorts to learn from their mistakes. But no. Episode II takes it farther. Somehow, Attack of the Clones actually managed to be worse than The Phantom Menace."
"Sep 09, 2011",1,One of the worst movies ever made. Possibly the worst movie of all time.
"Sep 09, 2011",2,"The romance in this film has about as much depth as a highschool fling. Maybe If Lucas had spent more time on the real story and less on the forced but nessecary love story maybe it could have panned out. Oh ya, also if he killed JarJar."
"Sep 09, 2011",1.5,Nothing epic about this!
"Sep 07, 2011",3.5,"better than phantom, some good stuff, romance is poorly done and anakin like a sulking teenager (which he is i guess).  Love the fight at end, gets an extra half star.  also enjoyed the obi wan sub plot on kamino."
"Sep 06, 2011",3.5,"Yes the dialogue still sucks and the romance aspect is boring as hell, but the second Star Wars prequel luckily has enough gripping action, dazzling visual spectacle, improved performances and some of the original trilogy's classic charm to make it worth your time to check out. Oh, and Jango Fett is freakin' awesome."
"Sep 05, 2011",4,Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones is another great prequel from George Lucas. The cast is back but with Samuel L. Jackson and Hayden Christensen. Jackson does a great job as a important Jedi named Mace Windu. Once I saw Christensen in this movie I knew he would become a great actor and he is. This time the war continues between the Jedi and the Sith. This time the droids are being controlled by Count Dooku. But the Republic are also making their army of clone troopers. George Lucas's sequel to the prequel series was another great movie.
"Sep 05, 2011",0.5,"This movie is so boring and stupid it is hard to express how forgettable it is. I mean I've seen it at least 3 times...and I barely remember it (the latest being fairly recently...and I still have forgotten or blocked most of it out of my head).  It is just a lame and forgettable showcase for Lucas' obsession with showing off CG.  It is a shame Lucas couldn't come up with any ideas beyond ""Star Wars"" to showcase effects...but the well ran dry I suppose. This movie is just effects with bad acting and the least believable romance in cinema."
"Sep 04, 2011",1,All I remember from this one was them sitting in a field of flowers...
"Sep 04, 2011",2.5,SW Episode II is def the weakest film of the series... drags on too much and the love-story was not well executed. My least fav of the Star Wars saga.
"Sep 01, 2011",1,You thought it couldn't get worse....well it did
"Aug 31, 2011",3,"Although it keeps intact the fun and thrilling action sequences of the franchise this is the lightest on a clear and structured narrative. The film has a lot to cram in which is good moving the plot along and adding to the mythos of the clone wars, but inevitably suffers due to this feeling of narrative dictation. The central love story although visually well done is hard to fully invest in due to the hammy dialogue and dull performances with actors such as McGregor, Lee and Jackson boosting the film."
"Aug 31, 2011",5,"Actually I'll revise that, this is the one where Natalie Portman gets hot"
"Aug 31, 2011",1,Slightly better than it's predecessor but still pretty shitty!
"Aug 31, 2011",2.5,"Out of the ""Neo-Trilogy,"" this is probably the lesser of the three evils, although lining up three solid chunks of canine feces and picking which one is the least putrid is not exactly singing it's praises. Compared to Empire (one must chuckle when pondering this comparison, despite being written by the same man), this is a disappointment of disappointments - but if we were to pretend the new trilogy is it's own beast entirely, than I would say they are all worth watching once. I did enjoy the scenes of Coruscant here and throughout the new trilogy, but I miss pretty much everything about the old one."
"Aug 31, 2011",4,Entertaining second episode.
"Aug 30, 2011",3,"The Galactic Republic forms a massive army made from clones of Jango Fett. Anakin and Padme fall in love. There, that's Attack of the Clones in a two-sentence nutshell"

"Aug 24, 2011",5,"While better than Episode I, Attack of the Clones is still not as good as installments from latter on in saga. Episode II brings back the fun of the original trilogy with a much better romantic subplot."

"Aug 19, 2011",4.5,Episode II is my favorite of the new trilogy of star wars.The action pretty damn awesome.The special effects are amazing and well crafted.Some of the acting is good.Ewan mcgregor does a good young obi one kenobi impression.And of course jango fett is in it the father of boba fett.The story for me worked for what it was trying to do.

"Aug 14, 2011",3.5,I like the way they introduced the clones. I liked it but for some reason people just don't like this one a lot.
"Aug 12, 2011",0.5,"With more pretentious writing, obvious coasting, more confusing plotting and pacing... not to the mention the dialogue and character falseness could easily make someone mistake this for being Joel Schumacher's handiwork."
"Aug 11, 2011",4,"The clones attacked and we were happy about it,"
"Aug 10, 2011",4,"I have to think that this one is my least favorite, but also the Episode that I also want to watch. I think that, for the prequels, Episodes I and III are the best ones. I still liked this one, but it had a shortened lightsaber boss battle, but an awesome epic battle, more story about the whole saga. So, I thought it was a good Star Wars Episode, but not one of my favorites."

This movie was geared for little kids which makes me feel like a d**n fool when i watch this. this movie puts visuals before story which makes me sick. i liked how they tried to show how Anakin is slowly turning evil, but they way they show it didnt fit me. 

Sorry Lucas"
"Aug 06, 2011",5,one of my other favorite films this movie made mwe laugh cry and i know how anakin feels when he mentions obi wan being like his father this movie made me understand the orginial trilogy even more this movie had a intrestering storyline we get introduced to a new bounty hunter charecter named jango fett and his son boba fett i felt jango fetts death happened all to soon i can see why now they put samuel l jackson as mace windu i happen to love the storyline between both anakin skywalker and padme amidala again this movie is on one of my favorite list of my favorite films
"Aug 06, 2011",3,"The weakest of all six movies. It starts off fairly slow for a Star Wars movie. The middle stuff with Obi-wan running around is good enough. The loves scenes are basically terrible by all standards. And the final act with all of the fighting is decent, but the lightsaber duels were rather boring."
"Aug 06, 2011",3.5,"Cannot lie: I love Padame's costuming in this film, but it is one of the weakest in a great series."
"Aug 05, 2011",2,"A mild improvement over The Phantom Menace, perhaps... but those who appreciate the original trilogy would never accept prequels like this into the canon!"

Anakin is now all grown up and he is now very arrogant. He is training with Obi-Wan and Queen Amidala is now known as Padme Amadala. Anakin is in love with Padme after he rescues her from assassination. Count Dooku is the main villain who wants to kill her. Later, the Clone Wars start as Star Wars relives its battle magic. Yoda has officially shown that he can battle a villain, as he nearly defeats Dooku.


                                            SPOILERS END HERE


I found this as a kind of boring movie. I couldn't keep up with it, but still, it's a Star Wars movie, and I love all of them. I just didn't like this one as much as all of the others."
"Aug 02, 2011",4,if you have seen this movie then i think you will agree that yoda is one bad ass when it comes to fighting with a lightsaber !
"Aug 01, 2011",3.5,"better than the first one, right?"
"Aug 01, 2011",4,"On the same field as Episode I in my opinion, but picks up the pace a bit and sets itself up nicely for Episode III."
"Jul 31, 2011",2.5,"I've always had a love-hate relationship with the Star Wars franchise, but I get the feeling that after completing my rewatching of all six movies, that bar will slide decisively to the ""love"" side of the spectrum. Okay, call me a fanboy. I admit it. I grew up with these films, and that makes it extremely difficult for me to judge them objectively without grinning from ear to ear as the opening credits roll (of course, with the exception of The Phantom Menace... I never liked that film). And so, although there are many out there who greatly despise Star Wars: Attack of the Clones (and justifiably so), I can't help but have fun with it. Sure, it's uneven-- Some parts are corny, hammy, and gratingly campy. The rest of it is corny, hammy, and campy, but gloriously so. After going for five years without seeing a Star Wars movie, and having seen The Phantom Menace last weekend, I can confidently say that this is the first time I've seen a real Star Wars film for a very, very long time.

Attack of the Clones takes place a few years after The Phantom Menace, when the Separatists are trying to separate from the Republic (hence the name). Why? Well, that's left open to interpretation, along with a lot of this film's political plot points. All you need to know is that this film is pretty evenly split between scenes that harken back to the Star Wars of old and scenes that reek of Satan's anus. The main plot of this movie features Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) sleuthing around the galaxy trying to find out who is orchestrating the current conflict between the different factions. This aspect of the film truly puts a smile on my face. McGregor clearly relishes in his role as Kenobi, and there are some absolutely awesome scenes between him and Boba Fett's dad, Diego-- er-- Jango Fett. Sure, the CGI has that awkward, cartoony, early 2000's look to it, but hey, that's actually part of the movie's charm (unlike in The Phantom Menace... God help me). Altogether, this entire plot is well-crafted and surprisingly layered for a Star Wars movie.

But then there's the other half of the film, which takes place back on the planet Naboo. You've probably heard a great deal (skinny) about this aspect of the film by now: Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Padme (Natalie Portman) begin to develop feelings for one another, despite the fact that Anakin is a Jedi and is not supposed to fall in love. These scenes are, in a word, nightmarish. Everyone talks about the line ""I don't like sand... it's coarse and rough and irritating... and it gets everywhere,"" but that's just the tip of the iceberg. There's a scene where Anakin levitates a pear and cuts it up for her, and then floats it back for her to eat. Then, they sit by the fireside, where Padme talks in great detail about how if they fall in love, they'd be ""Living a lie."" Oh no! Anything but that! Then, Anakin has nightmares about his mother, so he returns to Tatooine. There, he finds out that Sand People have taken her, so he massacres them all in a fit of rage. Padme then tells him not to feel bad about it. Sure, why not? It's just a little genocide!

What irks me about this aspect of the movie is not the fact that it exists. It's that it could have been made so much better. As with the political debates in Menace, the slightest effort from the scriptwriters on these scenes could have turned boring, cliched treacle into a truly involving story of Darth Vader's lost love and his turn to the dark side. If you want to enjoy this movie, I suggest that you turn the sound down during these scenes and instead play the audio from Richard Linklater's Before trilogy. I guarantee that things will become far more enjoyable. But bad romance aside, this movie is a serious improvement on The Phantom Anus in every way possible. I know that's not a high bar to jump over, but it's certainly a welcome return to form for the franchise. The battle scene at the end is overindulgent and decadent, but it's filmed coherently and I enjoyed the escapism of it (at least it wasn't bludgeoning Man of Steel-style action). The fight between Anakin and Dooku is terrible, but it's immediately saved by Yoda's appearance, which finally showcases why everyone calls him such a great Jedi. Altogether, I want to love this film at some times, and at others I want to hate it. It's not great, but it's no train wreck either.

Final Score for Attack of the Clones: 5/10 stars. I wish I could split this movie into two parts and rate them both separately, because large chunks of this movie are pretty much everything I want out of a Star Wars film. There's no deeper message, there's no real philosophical undertones, and the characters aren't very well-developed... but strangely, I'm okay with that. Star Wars is like an abusive relationship, where it continually hurts you but you can't help but come back to it. Because even at its worst parts, this movie kept me entertained, either because I was grinning like a little kid over the pew pew pews, or because I was laughing out loud at the horrible dialogue. Say what you will about its overall quality, but this movie has heart. In an age where blockbusters are ""dark"" and ""brooding,"" this is a film that Hollywood could probably learn something from. It's bombastic, it's loud, it's stupid, and it's corny. But I'll give it this: At least it's fun."
"Jul 31, 2011",4.5,The beginning of the Clone Wars at the end of the movie was spectacular!
"Jul 30, 2011",1.5,"The worst of the series, by far. Sapped of all fun, wonder or artistic flair, ""Attack of the Clones"" is only worth watching to complete the series."
"Jul 30, 2011",2.5,"...while the CGI does well to highten the action to an epic level, it suffers the same fate the film does. Lacking imagination and excitement. 
Grade: C-"
"Jul 30, 2011",0.5,"laughably bad.  Seriously, even if Hayden Christensen weren't such a ham, George Lucas does not know how to write a script.  The prequel trilogy lost all the charm that made the originals amazing. For shame, Lucas.  Half a star for Natalie Portman and Ewen McGregor, the only saving graces."
"Jul 30, 2011",0.5,Ruined the Star Wars franchise for me.  Hayden Christensen is TERRIBLE in it.
"Jul 28, 2011",3,"This was Oscar-worthy material, after what Phantom Menace was."
"Jul 25, 2011",3,"Good action, we finally get to see Yoda doing work. Not a great plot however."
"Jul 25, 2011",2.5,"""Attack of the Clones"" is the worst film of the six-part Star Wars saga. The introductions of characters such as the Fetts and the clones and the climax of all the jedi and clones showing their awesome fighting skills doesn't really make up for the robotic, unrealistic dialogue or the monotony that most of the movie is full of. The love story between Anakin and Padmé is nowhere near as believable as Han and Leia in the trilogy, and Mace Windu seemed the most out-of-character as he seems to forget being the most sceptical of the jedi towards Anakin. This is no more than an average film."
"Jul 25, 2011",5,Darth Vadar when he was sexy!!!
"Jul 24, 2011",2,"Good machines and fast-paced plot.  Anachin is annoying and Portman is in so much pain to make the romance believable.  The new Yoda is bogus, Jackson is so serious but just too much.  I guess the dialogue sucks too much for the actors to make much of.  Is McGregor Kenobi?  He seems more like an annoying big brother than a Jedi."
"Jul 24, 2011",1.5,George Lucas clearly has no one to challenge his ideas anymore.  How anyone rates this garbage above two stars is beyond me.
"Jul 24, 2011",4,"this is actually avery good movie its perfectly paced. the only fault with this movie is the dialouge between Anakin Skywalker and padme its just really really bad, but other then that i love this movie,"
"Jul 23, 2011",2,Horrible acting kills this one for me.
"Jul 23, 2011",4.5,better than Episode One but nowhere near as good as the ones to follow. They seem to get better with each episode.
"Jul 23, 2011",4,Probably my least favorite of the series but I still love it!
"Jul 22, 2011",3.5,"This movie is an improvment over The Phantom Menace. Its special effects are drastically better, and there is much more action and visual flair. However, this movie's biggest flaw is hard to ignore, and that flaw is poor casting choices for Anakin and Padme. Haden Christiansen and Natalie Portman are both very flat and unconvincing."
"Jul 22, 2011",2,the weakest of the entire saga but the romance is still more believable then twilight and any relationship i am in. XD
"Jul 22, 2011",3.5,"Better than Episode I. Just fast forward past every scene that Padme and Anakin share and you have a fast paced, sci-fi thrill ride with one of the best battles to ever hit the screen."
"Jul 22, 2011",2,"What is at first expected to be a sci-fi war movie is instead a boring lousy-written romance subplot overextended and full of bad acting (mainly for Hayden Christensen's Razzie Award-winning performance) and a complete lack of memorable and quotable dialogue (Razzie Award win for Worst Screenplay). Sure the typical visual thrills are still there to save us some serious trouble (ex: the Battle of Geonosis), but it's not enough this time. Thankfully, on the other hand Jar Jar Binks has a small role with no attempts at comic relief and C-3PO reprises his bumbling traditions, but that's pretty much it. Overall, it's another huge disappointment, let alone the weakest of the saga thanks to George Lucas' very weak writing."
"Jul 22, 2011",2.5,They ruined a great triolgy
"Jul 22, 2011",2.5,"When going with the newer set, this is probably my least favourite. The third is definatly the best. Ankin gets a bit moody in this one. But if you're watching it then you're probably watching the series, so you have to finish the set!"
"Jul 21, 2011",3,Another good prequel.
"Jul 19, 2011",3,"I don't know if it really messed up the first original movies like many other think, but the especial effects seem amazing and it's not boring, good enough for me."
"Jul 18, 2011",2.5,The weakest Star Wars film. Attack of the Clones finds itself mired in ample amounts cliched dialogue and a shallow performance by Hayden Christensen.
"Jul 18, 2011",4,"Lucas got rid of Jar-Jar for the most part, but his directing still sucks. I still like it for entertainment and overall storyline value. Natalie looks much hotter also..."
"Jul 18, 2011",4,"A little too mushy for me, but the Execution scene was good as well as the fight w/Count Dooku @ end... Again if it weren't S.W. I wouldnt've rated it so high"
"Jul 17, 2011",3.5,"While technologically brilliant, the profound philosophy of the Star Wars saga is lost in the dribble performances by Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, and Ewan McGregor. What remains is a fun and informative Star Wars film with all the Lucas charm, but nothing refreshing or refreshingly new."
"Jul 14, 2011",3,"It has its moments, but is the worst of the Star Wars Prequels and saga.Lucas should have know better than to direct this, an should have let someone else take the reigns like he did with Empire. Anyone else would have realized Hayden Christensen was not ready to play such a big role, and a bigger name would have made this seem more important. Lucas is so obsessed with special effects that it overwhelms the film. His weakness as a writer has never been displayed. This is a real disappointment"
"Jul 12, 2011",4,"The whole anikan/padime section of the movie is pretty obnoxious, but the clone wars are fantastic, not to mention the dual lightsaber duku battle and finally seeing Yoda behind a blade."
"Jul 12, 2011",0.5,What a fucking bore.
"Jul 12, 2011",3,"While yes, it is an improvement over Phantom Menace it still lacks a lot of what made the original trilogy great. It takes a lot from Empire, almost in a comical way. There are a lot of things I would change, but it still is an enjoyable movie to watch if you can turn your brain off the original trilogy for a while and just accept it."
"Jul 11, 2011",0.5,"Slightly better then the phantom but it's still bad.  Nothing improves from the first film, in fact it has all the same problems.  In this movie we get dry uninspired lifeless ""romance"", oh what joy."
"Jul 11, 2011",3,"It has improved on the things that brought down Episode 1, but an emotionless performance from it's core character prove there are still problems"
"Jul 10, 2011",3.5,Much better than episode I.
"Jul 10, 2011",2,I stand by my belief that Hayden Christensen was a horrible miscast
"Jul 10, 2011",0.5,"This is the best case to argue that Lucas' writing is what killed the series. It's not enough that most of these scenes were shot in front of a green screen, so everything is fake and digital. That of course made it hard for actors to emote properly. It doesn't help when the writing is just this awful, abysmal fake attempt at Shakespearean dialogue. The love scenes in these movies just drag it further into the ground. But the entire movie is just this one long boring blur. Really bad movie."
"Jul 08, 2011",1.5,"This movie will grip you with the strength of a toddler's grasp, but when you look at what is gripping you, it ain't no toddler at all
."
"Jul 08, 2011",2.5,Never was a fan of the magical space ninja's that expected me to take them seriously
"Jul 07, 2011",3,"The plot may be a bit too political for an epic Sci-Fi film, and especially for a Star Wars film, but this installment is strangely one of the most enjoyable ones and has some strong character development to match, not to mention the fact it's more intelligent than its predecessor."
"Jul 07, 2011",2,"This movie is painful except for about thirty minutes of action. The lead villain is so flat he makes the script look multidimensional, and so pompous he makes the skin crawl in an unintentional and unrequired way every time he's on camera, and the acting, dialogue and writing is a mess. Suffer through it only if you really love extraterrestrial monsters, there are many and they are very imaginative and well created. The battle droids are finally a credible threat, too. It's only a shame old man Lucas put the shift on a romance so boring it makes even die-hard Star Wars fans question why they still support the franchise, because the Separatist Crisis is genuinely interesting, and a story that could have been (and was in Genndy Tarmovsky's Clone Wars series) explored to great effect."
"Jul 06, 2011",2,Forgettable. There isn't much to gawk at in this movie aside from progressing the Star Wars story for the very least.
"Jul 05, 2011",3,"Ok, when my dad took me out of school in 2002, I was super excited to see it. As a 6 year old, I loved it. I saw it again when I was 9 I really liked it, but I felt there was something wrong with it. About a month ago, i watch it for the first time in 5 years, and I did still like it, but I noticed something. Hayden Christensen is not a good actor. He gives anakin almost no emotion, and I stopped caring about the sub plot of anakin in the movie. Luckily, episode two was saved by Ewan Mcgregor's good performance and the Jedi and clone battles toward the end."
"Jul 04, 2011",2,"Suffers the Empire dilemma of being a bridge film.  The action is interesting, and Jango Fett only reminds the audience of Boba's presence in the original trilogy.  Ultimately, a merely passable movie, but a bad entry period for the Star Wars series."
"Jul 03, 2011",3.5,"Attack of the Clones was an odd title choice and clearly shows George Lucas was in a different place compared to the legion of fans. This sequel does little to course correct the damage done by The Phantom Menace. It has more stilted dialogue and laugh out loud moments, unintentional moments. The kiss on the cheek moment in the death pit has to be the oddest choice by a filmmaker, I'm sorry George, but seriously. The rest of the film is okay and is more about uncovering the plot of the Sith. The one thing I will say about George Lucas, no film in the Saga he created is the same. There's no recycling plot threads, or story beats, each film is an individual. Attack of the Clones has a corny title and is campy at times, but there's still a lot of good stuff in here. Anakin struggling with the balance and Obi Wan investigating the Sith plot. These are good things surrounded by odd filmmaker choices and bizarre choices. I don't believe the casting choices were right for certain characters and filming in Australia obviously is the reasoning here. It's easy to watch but not near the brilliance of the original trilogy. 08/04/2020"
"Jul 03, 2011",5,Near perfect aside from the acting I parts
"Jul 03, 2011",3,"R2D2 can fly now?  that might've been useful in the other 5 films also.

waaaay too many Australians and New Zealanders in this movie.. death stick salesman indeed. Damo has come a long way from Summer Bay!

at least Boba has lost his NZ twang by Empire.

bonus star for giving Jar Jar Binky minimal lines."
"Jul 02, 2011",4.5,Yeah the chemistry needed some help but it is still an awesome movie.
"Jul 01, 2011",2,"re watched it not too long ago...Easily the worst film of the saga.  Bad acting, bad script, awkward throw backs to original trilogy.  Ewan McGregor is the best thing in the movie (as is pretty much the case with the entire prequel trilogy)  the only valid reason to watch this movie are his scenes and the fact that you need the plot for episode 3"
"Jun 30, 2011",1,"While slightly, ever-so slightly better than Phantom Menace, Clones attempts to make up for a boring movie by making a ""love story"" the center of this movie. And it doesn't work, at all. The 2 leads barely know each other, so how can they ""love"" each other? The will of the Force? Bullsh*t. Stupid, lame, and is barely saved by the action scenes."
"Jun 30, 2011",3.5,Not as good as the other two in the new trilogy but not bad.
"Jun 29, 2011",4,"Terrible romance aside, this was still a great movie, with beautiful art direction and some of the best fight scenes I've seen."
"Jun 29, 2011",2,"UUUGGGGHHHHHH!!!!! What the hell happened here?! I actually liked Episode I but this is awful...as far as I'm concerned this film single handedly made the word ""prequel"" a four letter word!"

"Jun 26, 2011",2.5,"While it has its moments, Attack of the Clones marks the continuation on the Star Wars downfall, notably with the unwise casting decision of Hayden Christiensen, and the return of the not-so-lovable buffoon, Jar Jar Binks."
"Jun 25, 2011",3.5,"This is a good film, but nowhere near as good as any other chapter from the saga."
"Jun 23, 2011",4,"Yes this is my favorite #4 on the Star Wars saga. The ""symptoms"" that start showing Anakin's impotence. His hearth vs his sense of justice, his beliefes vs the actual politics. His problem with ""letting go"". A prequel of the inevitable."
"Jun 22, 2011",4,ok but still can't touch the original
"Jun 21, 2011",3,"The action sequences are exellent, the over all visuals are good, but the crappy dialogue really drags this movie down."
"Jun 21, 2011",4.5,"One of the best Star Wars movies out there, awesome."
"Jun 21, 2011",1.5,"It did it's job, and it continued the second trilogy and entertained."
"Jun 19, 2011",3,This movie was rally good but the Book was way better. The relationship was so rushed that it was like.. Oh.. she loves him too? Another issues O had was the lack of dirt on people.. this movie was too clean. PadmÃ (C) wearing white and never getting a smudge on it even after rolling around in a molten metal bucket and falling in sand and etc. ... plus it needed more Jar Jar in it.
"Jun 19, 2011",3,"Easily the worst of the lot but it still gets a 3 star rating, It is easier to follow than the first and there is more action that's pretty good most of the time, It was nice to see more original cast, but it felt weird having the clone army on the good side but it was a good way to introduce them plus having Yoda finally used in the action was pretty good even if it was only for a short time, My main concerns were that just like the first there is too much CGI and they looked ok but not great and again it spoiled the tone of the movie and it just never really felt like a Star Wars movie in places but some good action scenes nearly make up for it, One of the main reasons The Phantom Menace was disliked was Jar Jar Binks and thankfully he's been toned down an awful lot in this film with less screen time and hardly no jokes but it didn't save the movie from being great but if they never toned him down this film would of been a complete disaster so let's be thankful for that, It's maybe the worst Star Wars movie but it's still a worth watching."
"Jun 18, 2011",2,The love story is too long and missing some action and space battle action!
"Jun 17, 2011",3.5,"Like Deja Vu all over again...

OK.... if Episode I was eerily like Episode IV, Episode II was certainly going to try and rip off 'Empire..'. 

Well, we got to meet the new Sith Lord, and Christopher Lee was already, easily, the Man... so this just made it better. Add a little Jackie Chan-esque Yoda action with a dash of the Fett-Man's dad... mix with a few million clone troopers and big fat whiney bitch Jedi savior... sure, you got a movie. 

Epic, no, not quite. But, definately a popcorn film, no breaks allowed."
"Jun 17, 2011",2,so-so but an improvement of the phantom menace
"Jun 17, 2011",3.5,This was great to watch... bad chemistry between Anikin... (whatever) and Padme is awful... but the rest makes up for it
"Jun 16, 2011",2,"To tell you the truth, I'm not entirely sure why this movie is guaranteed fresh. I have many of the common complaints some of you have heard of before. As a lifelong fan of these movies (and I mean LIFE-long), I couldn't believe how bastardized the film was, throwing in a Boba Fett storyline for no reason just to name ONE problem. 
The biggest issue with this film is the interpretation of Anakin. In the original Star Wars movies, he was described as a noble Jedi Knight who was kind and wise just like any other Jedi. Instead, Anakin is whiny, obnoxious, and won't shut the hell up about how Obi-Wan is ruining his life. 
On top of that, the plot itself- Palpatine corrupting the Senate because he's a Sith Lord and wants more political power- is flawed. We are never given an example of how powerful he is, so we are left to guess at what stupid actions by the Senate are by his mind-tricks or by the result of stupidity on part of the Senate (JAR-JAR *ahem*). I just don't understand it- the Senate won't approve the use of a Clone Army, but they'll grant the Chancellor (Palpatine) emergency powers so that HE can will make the army? So, then, what, they agreed that the army is necessary but just didn't want to take the blame for it? 
I don't get why that makes sense, and I don't get why people like this movie, or any of the other Star Wars prequels. But that's just one opinion."
"Jun 15, 2011",3,Not that bad really.  It's actually the one prequel that ruined the canon the least.  WAY better than Phantom Menace for sure.  The love scenes are probably the worst in film history though.
"Jun 14, 2011",2.5,"Yoda fights with a lightsaber--that goes a long way toward making up for all the crappy plot developments that upset hardcore Star Wars fans.  The whole movie was shot on a computer or in front of a green screen (literally), and that does show in the visuals and the acting."
"Jun 14, 2011",3.5,"Better than THE PHANTOM MENACE, but still not as good as anything from the original trilogy."
"Jun 14, 2011",4,"All in all, a far more superior film than its predecessor."
"Jun 13, 2011",3.5,"This one was much better than the first one. The way I see it, however, the acting gets better and better throughout the movie. I prefer this movie over Episode 1 because there is more conflict among the main characters."
"Jun 13, 2011",3,"Rating : ★★★★

Whilst I enjoyed The Phantom Menace, it didn't go without it's flaws. As some might know from my review I credited the action sequences and much more but it was let down by some very poor performances. So we hit the second episode of the second trilogy. I must say once again I enjoyed, possibly more than the previous. It felt much more in continuity with the the originals and at the same time retains the continuity with Phantom Menace. Whilst Phantom Menace still felt like Star Wars there was very little carried over. Apart from Yoda, Obi-Wan, Tatooine, Lightsabers, The Emperor and a few terms (Jedi, Sith etc) there was very little to please the hardcore Star Wars fans who seem to loath Episode 1. This time around there is very little to complain about on that front. We are treated to many things from the original including Boba Fett, Slave 1, Luke's home, Uncle Owen, Death Star, Storm troopers and many more. So let's discuss the movie.

The movie is set 10 years after the events in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, when the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of a renegade Jedi named Count Dooku, thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic. When an assassination attempt is made on Senator Padmé Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo, 20-year-old Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect her, while his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt. Soon, Anakin, Padmé, and Obi-Wan are drawn into the heart of the Separatist territories and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy, the Clone Wars.

So I really liked the plot this time around. It feels very much like a middle movie much like Empire felt for the trilogy in which no introduction is needed and is left on a cliffhanger like ending waiting to be tied up in the final instalment. The fact that the movie begins with an assassination attempt gave me the feeling that this film was going to take a slight different path to Phantom that felt like it was on the bright end of the scale movies. There were many things about this film that I liked. Firstly I really enjoyed the high speed chase at the beginning. It felt good fun and reminded me a little of the one we see in Return of the Jedi. The fact that bounty hunters were re introduced was really cool as I liked the idea of them throughout the original trilogy. Boba Fett returns here but as a young boy and we get to see his father Jango wearing the suit but with this one looking brand new and Slave 1 looking less battle worn. I really liked the showing of the relationship between Palpatine and Anakin. It gave a feeling that Palpatine was already playing him as his pawn preparing him as apprentice in secret. It also played upon Palpatine's words at the end of E1 in which he mentions about keeping a close eye on him. The introduction of the origins of Storm Troopers was interesting but was interesting to see and gives a nice explanation to where they came from. The final act was great as well in which we got to experience an arena deathmatch, a huge seperatist vs Jedi battle, Republic v Seperatist battle, Anakin/Kenobi v Dooku lightsaber duel and Yoda v Dooku lightsaber duel. It was a totally action packed moment that allowed me to forget all that was crap about the movie and enjoy Star Wars on a grand scale. What was interesting to see in this movie was how early one Anakin gets seduced by the Dark Side. His moment on Tatooine with the Raiders was prime example as he takes anger and revenge in to account and slays them all. One minor moment that I personally loved was the Kenobi chase of the Fett's. It was pretty cool and the seismic charges were awesome weapons that put off an awesomely cool sound. The moment that Kenobi first sees the battle ready clones also was too a brilliant moment that sent shivers down my back (probably thanks to John Williams score).

But along with the good stuff there always comes the crap. The entire love plot was boring and just not believeable. I felt no chemistry between Anakin and Padme and if anything Anakin felt like a huge pervert who at much of the time creeped Padme out. The moments also were slotted in to areas which completely killed the tension of previous scenes. Seeing Jar Jar back was also a low blow. He was tolerable in the first but the moment I seen him the second I was just like 'OHHHH GO AWAY!'. 

So the acting in this movie. Ewan McGregor puts on a similar performance as he did in E1 but this time around it felt a little too plain and at moments lifeless. Hayden Christensen was ok if a little too shaky as Anakin. Whilst at times he was good, other moments he was terrible and lifeless. Natalie Portman whilst not putting on a brilliant performance does a far better job this time around than she done in E1 which made me happier but still. Apart from that most of the performances in this movie were pretty good. Ian McDiarmid puts on a great performance as Palpatine and the introduction of Christopher Lee as Dooku was great. His performance was good but being honest, I think Lee would have done a brilliant job even if he had a small role as Yoda's paper boy. I enjoyed that the humour this time around was brought back to C-3PO and R2-D2. They were the comedy pair of the originals and I very much enjoyed their moments in this. 

The visual effects were very good in this film with much of it looking brilliant. The new planets introduced were pretty good and a personal favourite being Kamino. The visuals in this are were brilliant especially the water. The new species and creatures were welcomed happily too. John Williams score as usual was brilliant and many of the new themes were great. I personally liked the moment when Anakin explains to Padme what he done to the Raiders and the Imperial March begins to play. It really brought about the idea of Darth Vader and I noticed in that scene that it was playing the theme for the Emperor in Return of the Jedi. The end scene of the clones boarding space crafts was also accompanied by a brilliant score moment that gave goosebumps. 

So no the film weren't brilliant and came with it's flaws, many similar to Phantom Menace but it was enjoyable none the less. The fact we got to see pre Empire era Stormtroopers and Yoda battling it out with Dooku sold it for me. It stil has nothing on the originals but I'm not expecting in too. I found this a great entry in the franchise that had brilliant set pieces, brilliant action and much more but is ultimately let down by the poor acting. Hopefully Episode III got rid of these problems then ey?"
"Jun 12, 2011",2,"The worst of the prequels in my opinion. the dialogue ""stiff"" and ""flat.""  I was pleased to see that Jar Jar Binks plays only a minor role.Anakin and Padme's relationship was just one big cliche and the plot was just jumbled and mixed around like it had had major edit done to it minutes before it showed and the wooden characterizations and dialogue don't help."
"Jun 12, 2011",1,"It's been nine years; the special affects are now dated and thus unimpressive. Consequently, there is officially no reason to watch this film. Hard to imagine that there was a time in the 70's when George Lucas was a good storyteller..."
"Jun 12, 2011",3.5,"A considerable improvement over The Phantom Menace, with more action, less talk about midichlorians, and a badass Christopher Lee. Still, it's no Empire Strikes Back"
"Jun 11, 2011",3,It's not Empire Strikes Back.
"Jun 11, 2011",2.5,"Worth watching, but only for the last 40 minutes. Anything before it is boring and cliched, but everything during those 40 minutes is pure Star Wars. Full Review Coming In Upcoming Days."
"Jun 10, 2011",3,The worst of the Epic Star Wars saga. But none the less- Epic.
"Jun 10, 2011",3,"Has a lot of flaws, and not as good as Phantom, but still a lot of fun."
"Jun 10, 2011",5,"I love this movie. For one, its sci-fi. For two, I love the actress :P, and for three, I like the story."
"Jun 10, 2011",2.5,"Love Star Wars, though the prequels are kinda umm..."
"Jun 06, 2011",3.5,Long and nearly choked by Hayden Christensens performance and the love story. Luckily as always Obi Wan and Yoda save the day.
"Jun 06, 2011",2,"It's hard not to dislike this movie. It's really flawed and has a terrible script, but the star wars aura makes it decent. Really uncomfortable to watch when Hayden Christensen speaks"
"Jun 06, 2011",4,"""Attack of the Clones"" is a mess, but it's a glorious mess. The mediocrity of Episode I is replaced with bold artistic ambition, even if Lucas's directorial skills collapse under the weight of it all. With lush, powerful cinematography and charged action sequences, Episode II also provides some emotionally powerful storytelling on Tatooine, as Anakin's fall to the dark side begins centered around his mother: Shmi. Unfortunately, to get to the good bits the audience must suffer through the agonizingly embarrassing courtship scenes and the painfully absent chemistry between our two leads, but the arena is a blast, Ewan McGregor delights as Obi-Wan, and the ambition and artistry, if obviously flawed, is present once again. The Force isn't strong with this one, but at least it's there."
"Jun 06, 2011",3.5,"Attack of the Clones in the other hand is in comparison a superior achievement from PM. But it does contain couple of unnecessary segments, which drag the speed of the film down. And some of the acting is, even in the standard of the Star Wars, pretty horrible. But happily all those under achievers are not in any important roles and seasoned actors like Christopher Lee (Count Dooku) do deliver what you expect of them. others deserving nomination here are Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine.

So, the plot. Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are told to watch over senator Padame (Natalie Portman) because of assassination attempts towards her life. This soon leads in Obi in discovery of secretly manufactured clone army. Who is behind all this? Will Padame and Anakin fall in love? When does Anakin fall in to the dark side? Will he become a Jedi before all this? Some of these questions are partly answered in AOTC, but some are left waiting for the third installment of the new trilogy.

But as said, this is much better film than Phantom Menace. It's not best film in the Star Wars saga, but in my opinion it does deliver. It's mostly fun to watch, action sequences are good, special effects are even better and despise some bad acting and some pretty horrible dialogs, it wasn't pain in the back side to watch."
"Jun 06, 2011",2.5,"This, for me, is the worst Star Wars film there is."
"Jun 05, 2011",5,This movie was so great! A perfect sequel to the Phantom Menace. I am a big Star Wars fan and this movie was great with awesome new characters such as Jango Fett! 3 out of 5 stars! Excellent movie!

"May 31, 2011",1,Pointless. Dissapointing addition to the franchise that spawned a fan-following unlike any other.
"May 30, 2011",1.5,"[35/D-] With the manifestation of this incredibly fatuous and sappy episode of the spiraling-out-of-control Star Wars franchise it was clear that whatever lingering sparks of free-flowing, swashbuckling, exuberant cinema fans believed could still have inhabited the doubtful creative processes of Lucas had parachuted into oblivion sometime in the early 1980s, if they had ever really existed at all outside of fortunate happenstance and technical limitations.

Although Attack Of The Clones may even improve upon its immediate predecessor's stiltedness and blank dramaturgy, the insanely amateurish dialogue and direction devoid of any instinct for surprise or deep emotional investment, not to mention the utter indifference to anything but the most prosaic possibilities of characterization, seal the doom on this great galactic lemon with impressive incompetence.

Of course, poor Hayden Christensen magnifies all these delightful trends, proving utterly indispensable (and overly generous) at the task of systematically dismantling a dream. A royal disaster."

"May 29, 2011",3,"More entertainment that actual substance (and by ""substance"" I mean the god-awful romance subplot), Attack of the Clones is definitely the weakest installment in the epic series. The action and special effects along with all locations, spaceships, and everything else are pretty great at the expense of a weaker plot with far less interesting characters and the nail in the coffin that is Hayden Christensen."

"May 17, 2011",4,"I do not like Hayden Christensen's acting, but I really am enjoying seeing this world with better special effects not to mention the amazing final battle scene in the arena."
"May 17, 2011",0.5,"If The Phantom Menace was a pretty bad Star Wars movie, and a huge disappointment, then Attack of the Clones is basically the bloated version of all of its flaws and worse. The awful dialogue, awkward looking effects, and terrible characters make Attack of the Clones as dull as it is cheesy, and as unappealing as a lightsaber to the face."
"May 17, 2011",2.5,"I'm actually embarrassed for Hayden, quite possibly one of the worse actors I've ever seen on screen. Watching Anakin and Padme ""falling in love"" with each other was incredibly painful and that being an important driving plot was well, not so great for the movie as a whole.

I mean sure, it had all the amazing/cool concepts of every Star Wars movie, lightsaber battles and everyone loves the Fett Bounty Hunters. Does that save this disastrous love story?"
"May 15, 2011",4,"Though not perfect; Attack of the Clones gives you the Star Wars fun that you didn't get with the first one. Along with cool action scenes, and creative CGI, Episode II is a serious improvement over The Phantom Menace."
"May 15, 2011",4,I have a soft spot for the new Star Wars.
"May 15, 2011",4,"Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is possibly my least favorite of all the Star Wars films but at no way is it a good film on the contrary its a very good.
Set ten years after the events of The Phantom Menace, the galaxy is on the brink of civil war. Under the leadership of a renegade Jedi named Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) thousands of planetary systems threaten to secede from the Galactic Republic and has organized a Separatist movement against the Republic. 
Senator PadmÃ (C) Amidala is has an assassination attempt made on her life when she returns to Coruscant to vote on the issue of creating an army for the Republic to assist the Jedi against the Separatist threat.
Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) now a Jedi apprentice is assigned to protect her, while Obi-Wan Kenobi (now his mentor) is assigned to investigate the assassination attempt.
Soon, Anakin, PadmÃ (C), and Obi-Wan are drawn into the heart of the Separatist territories and the beginning of a new threat to the galaxy, the Clone Wars.
The plot was good and very impressively mirrors The Empire Strikes Back (George Lucas often describes the saga as a long poem that rhymes) it also has some very interesting themes. However it can get a bit long at times.
George Lucas as usual does a good job at directing, the cinematography is gorgeous, the special effects way improve on the first film, the locations are stunning, the production design is beautiful, the costumes are great, the scenery is breathtaking, the score is catchy and the ending was superb. 
I'm fascinated by the  love story between Anakin and Padme, on the one hand I like it because it helps develop and add depth to their characters and shows how much they care about each other.
The acting was excellent as well particularly from McGregor, Christensen and Portman who play their roles effortlessly.
For me Attack of the Clones may be the weakest film in the saga but I think its a great film nonetheless.
Please comment."
"May 13, 2011",3.5,"Better than Episode 1, but still lacking what the originals had."
"May 13, 2011",2.5,"Too much effects. Unnecessary Bollywood moments between Portman and Christensen, i mean really, rolling around outside with the waterfall as background *speechless*..The story line is much better than the first, they just tying up loose ends."
"May 12, 2011",4,"Really liked it.

Hayden Christensen is beyond perfection of who Darth Vader was as a young man, they nailed that on the head. Vader has always been my favorite character in any movie, so to see an actor that I love so much portray him so accurately is just great. Can see how his pain and anger is starting to twist his mind and priorities."
"May 11, 2011",4,"The current Disney mess has really put this movie in a new light, bumped up to 4 stars."
"May 11, 2011",3,"Very good, even if Hayden Christensen is a little wooden in his performance. Lots of little plot points that make the big fans tingle."
"May 09, 2011",3,its like twilight with a really cool light saber seen at the end
"May 07, 2011",2.5,"This movie is DULL and it has the most mind numbingly boring star wars movie ever made. The characters does not develop and the ""romance"" is so freaking forced. I sometimes wonder why it even exist. Oh god, the acting....."
"May 07, 2011",2.5,"Hayden Christensen can't act his way out of a paper bag in the lighter, romantic scenes, but somehow finds his way in the second half as brooding Anakin Skywalker.  In fact, no one is particularly on top of their game in the early going, as if they are trying to figure out how to act against a back drop of special effects.  The film whips between different storylines with all the grace of a lightsaber cutting through butter.  That is to say, scenes are intercut with one another seemingly to remind the audience something else is going on in the movie.  The end battle feels too perfunctory and the effects look positively old school.  But it is a further adventure in this universe and the imagination of the creature designers is on full display.  That is good enough for a couple hours of entertainment."
"May 07, 2011",2.5,"While there are a few decent performances, and the effects and third act almost save the film, there is way too many scenes of drawn out, uninteresting dialogue and some laughably bad romantic banter between Anakin and Padme."
"May 05, 2011",3,"Better than Phantom Menace, but still not that great!"
"May 05, 2011",3,"Hayden Christiansen is grossly miscast as the future Darth Vader, and there are moments in the script that are cringe-worthy bad writing, but it is still more entertaining and exciting than ""Phantom Menace""."
"May 03, 2011",3.5,"70% Positive 30% Negative

Postive:

Jake is nowhere is site and Jar-Jar is a cameo. The action is great. Natalie and Ewan can deliver the cheesy dialog with enough weight to make scenes work.

Negative:

Uhhh the dialog, its just bad and the story? it feels hobbled together."
"May 02, 2011",3.5,"Still suffers from mediocre acting and dialogue, but overall much better than Phantom Menace. Grade: B"
"May 01, 2011",4,A lot better than I which has a much clear plot and has much more action.
"Apr 30, 2011",1,"I don't think I have experienced script writing as bad as this, the love story between Padme and Anakin makes most of the romantic comedies I have seen in the background in my house look good, oh hell, most Adam Sandler films feel like more potent films in terms of writing and love story. And then you get into the bizarro art style which is, to say the least, brilliantly conceived, by some of the best concept artists in the world, and yet George Lucas just doesn't seem to be directing it for anything more than a toy line these days. Many people will argue that the only thing keeping the original Star Wars better in peoples minds is the nostalgia, after witnessing some of this film recently and refreshing my mind of the time I saw it in theaters, a long time ago; I disagree. The originals knew how to have a sense of humor and not let it destroy the whole film, they had a sense of camp that made the grimmer shit just seem grimmer. They also had such a thing as pacing, and while they certainly weren't in my opinion, the masterpieces people say they are, not even close, they certainly weren't this garbage. This is a bunch of weird battle scenes that don't know if they are supposed to be funny or dark, held together loosely and badly by some of the worst writing I have ever seen come out of a famous director. There are many moments in this film that infuriate me, beyond the fact that it is famous and popular when it is completely horrid filmmaking and extremely stagnant to watch, I would like to focus in on one such moment: When Anakin starts murdering sand people by the dozen in a scene that is supposed to emphasize his decent into madness, instead of actually getting to see that, you get this looney tunes circle that centers in on Anakin and forms a scene transition. What the hell? When were these decisions made, what was he smoking when he made them, what was he trying to accomplish in the viewer with that kind of thing. I wanted the prequel to Star Wars directed by the genius who directed THX1138 for his thesis on a shoe string budget, instead I got ""Please don't look at me like that."" ""Why not?"" ""It makes me feel uncomfortable."" And then a scene transition spinny wheel thing to an epic city scape with epic music. That pretty much is how the whole film is, completely and utterly failing to balance its intimate story of Anakin and Padme with it's bigger war story, and not only failing to do that, but also making me feel really uncomfortable and awkward at the sheer crap factor of it. It ticks me off that he made bad films out of this mythology, he was a good director once, and I feel like he secretly still is one, but he has just lost all sense of discipline in his film making."
"Apr 28, 2011",5,"love all of the star war movies, have watched all with oldest grandson"
"Apr 27, 2011",3,"While the action was awesome, and nothing beats Yoda fighting, I never once felt that any of the characters were in any danger, and the entire scene in the Droid factory was a complete waste of my viewing time. ."
"Apr 27, 2011",2.5,Its out of the frying pan and into the fire with this one as they took out Jar Jar Binks except for one or two scenes and replaced him with Hayden Christenson who is perhaps one of the worst actors in Hollywood history.
"Apr 26, 2011",4,The best of the prequel trilogy. Somehow this looked better in 2002 when it came out. Now the overuse of CGI backgrounds bothers me.
"Apr 26, 2011",4.5,Star wars is awesome and this movie is no different!
"Apr 26, 2011",3,Disappointing! Almost as much as Phantom Menace!
"Apr 25, 2011",3,Only saved by the special effects. Overly long story and poor acting by a number of the cast.
"Apr 25, 2011",0.5,No no no no no. BAD George Lucas.
"Apr 22, 2011",0.5,"I'm not going to review Attack of the Clones. I saw it once, but I can't tell you for sure whether ""clones"" ever actually attacked anyone. I doubt it. I guess I was too caught up in George Lucas's ""sophisticated"" plot and its impenetrable ""political intrigue"" to notice. If you actually like this movie, then I'm truly sorry that someone dropped a cinder block on your head when you were young. I hope that one day science finds a treatment that will heal your marginally functional brain. 

This movie actually led a homicide when a drunk mistook a fat man with beard for George Lucas and stabbed him. It wouldn't have been a fatal stabbing except that no one at the bar wanted to call 911. They were too busy cheering and applauding."
"Apr 22, 2011",5,"If I could give it more stars I would. Episode II, my top favorite of all the Star Wars movies and all other movies I've seen. Clone Troopers, Jango Fett, Geonosis, all very cool. 10/5"
"Apr 22, 2011",1.5,"dull acting especially from haydenson and portman , luckily they get better in ep 3"
"Apr 21, 2011",2.5,Loved this as a kid. Now I see it as what it truly is.
"Apr 20, 2011",2.5,"Some may find this surprising, but i feel Attack of the Clones is one of the worst, if not the worst movie of the franchise. Although the overall story was much better than Phantom Menace, the script was far worse (in terms of dialogue, mainly). Watching Hayden Christiensen onscreen was downright painful, i couldn't stand watching the awkward scenes between he and the always good Natalie Portman. The only reason to watch this episode is to be part of the story as we near the end of the saga, as well as to experience great special effects. The last 30-40 minutes of the film were the only minutes I actually enjoyed. It's also great to realize why we all love Yoda. Disappointing, forgetful, but the end of the franchise draws near. So pay no attention to this blemish on the saga. The real stuff is about to begin."
"Apr 20, 2011",3.5,The worst of the 6 movies but still would watch them all.
"Apr 19, 2011",3,"Although I hated the prequels, I can never say no to star wars."
"Apr 18, 2011",0.5,"Dear George Lucas, fuck you.
Sincerly, the fans."
"Apr 18, 2011",1.5,"Worst in the whole series. Its slow, boring, and has awful acting. The action scenes are decent, but not as good as the ones in episode I"
"Apr 17, 2011",0.5,Worst Star Wars film ever made. A true pain to watch.
"Apr 17, 2011",3.5,A step above Menace but then gets beaten down with a love story that is very forced. Excellent battles and special effects will keep everyone entertained.
"Apr 17, 2011",3,"This film was no better than the Phantom Menace. On the other hand, I do not think that Hayden Christensen is a bad actor. Let's face it, people say he is a bad actor for the same reason they do Robert Pattinson; they either don't like the character, the film, or both. As a whole, I cannot see what was wrong with this film at all. The main reason it has bad credit, in my opinion, is because it is a romance film more than anything else. But it had to be, the largest reason Anakin turns to the dark side is for his love of Padmé so there had to be a film which looked into the relationship deeply. There was no way we could understand their relationship if the romance was like that of Leia and Han in the originals. I like this film more than the Phantom Menace."
"Apr 16, 2011",2,"Not bad just worse than any other Star Wars films this one is as tired and lame as not many sequels are. Alto the CGI is stunning, this is a forgettable and out of place sequel."
"Apr 14, 2011",3.5,I'd enjoyed this one a little more than the Phantom Menance because of the dark ending wanting you to look forward to episode III.
"Apr 13, 2011",2,Trying to give these movies credit... but they are just SO BAD.
"Apr 12, 2011",1,AWFUL FROM START TO FINISH!
"Apr 12, 2011",3,"Gah! The extremely forced romance! Not as bad as the Phantom Menace, though. The gigantic action scenes at the end were it's saving grace."
"Apr 12, 2011",3,"On of the weaker films in the series, very little going on plot-wise."
"Apr 12, 2011",4,The return of the Fett-man makes the movie.
"Apr 12, 2011",3.5,"As any mature film maker should do, especially in the sensitive case of star wars and it's new trilogy, Lucas learned where he went wrong with Episode II...I think. At times, one wants to think Lucas learned something. Other times, we believe that he is still clinging onto the old formula of Episode 1 that didn't really work. But I have decided that he truly did learn a lesson and decided to add some pretty fights and scenery to go along with a slightly more tasteful experience than the Episode 1."
"Apr 11, 2011",3.5,While not as good as the originals this movie does begin to make up for episode 1. The dialogue can still be painful at times but the action and battle scenes are 2nd to none. Nobody will say this is movie is oscar worthy but the plot is deep enough to progress the story and entertain.
"Apr 11, 2011",2,A botched love story and a botched mystery plot combine to make a dull film.
"Apr 10, 2011",3.5,yoda on the light saber
"Apr 09, 2011",4,Hayden Christensen is one of the sexiest men alive plus its a good movie.
"Apr 09, 2011",2,"The 2nd installment of the Star Wars series finds Anakin Skywalker now a grown up young man in the middle of the teachings of becoming a Jedi knight and learning the ways of the force. 

The main emphasis of the film centers on the clone wars and the overall creation of
the clone troopers which later evolved into the infamous storm troopers. Although cool,it was still a rather major let down.

From the stupid romantic plot between Anakin and Padme to the dragged out mysterious planet where the troopers were created it just overall lacked. The best thing I liked was the story behind Boba fett and his father Jango Fett  both being bounty hunters.

Yet again even though the story was bad,George Lucas made up for lost times by giving the film latest in CGI and as well as giving it one of the few films at that time to be shot in HD.

With all the awesome action segments and all it couldn't stop the film from being nothing more than a so so film in the series."
"Apr 08, 2011",1,i cant start to tell you how shit this movie is.but maybe later i will
"Apr 07, 2011",4,"Better than Phantom Menace, but nothing compared to Revenge of the Sith! I loved seeing Anakin start to turn to the dark side!"
"Apr 06, 2011",0.5,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice? Shame on me."
"Apr 06, 2011",3.5,Another good film with the action maintaining the high level from the first..! this one also adds a romantic sub plot which gives deeper characterisation..!
"Apr 05, 2011",0.5,"This movie raped my mind with sadness. Lucas was a rebel in the 70s and was about timing and special affects from scrap, and it was amazing, he said that he didn't need computers and cool visuals he said that it all comes from your mind. Now he's doing the complete opposite. You are becoming the exact thing you despised Lucas, you made one of the crappiest movies of all time."
"Apr 05, 2011",3,It's ok that's about it
"Apr 05, 2011",1,"Natalie Portman in multiple sexy costumes can't save it. Oh George, what have you done?!"
"Apr 04, 2011",3,Definitely could have been a great film. Definitely wasn't.
"Apr 04, 2011",2.5,"A breathtaking speeder chase, boba fett, a battle in a colliseum, and an alright yet short batte with Count Dooku...sure theres more villains and a bigger plot forming, yet the movie lacked something..."
"Apr 02, 2011",2,"It was disappointing when I was a kid, and its disappointing now."
"Apr 02, 2011",0.5,The word is that Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford both fell asleep during the premiere of this movie. I know why.
"Apr 02, 2011",3,Terrible dialogue but the battle near the end pretty much makes the movie.
"Apr 01, 2011",3.5,"This is a good movie to watch if your in the mood for a complex story, a lot of action, and great special effects, but it doesn't have as much entertainment as most of the others. The fights are good, like Dooku vs yoda, obi wan vs jango, mace windu vs jango, and anikan vs anikan. But it does have a pretty complex story that can get confusing, it a good movie, but don't try to understand the logic, your brain will explode. Episode 2 is fun, it's a nice ride that can really can make you head spin, for the most part, but the few times its boring, its really boring and almost ruins the film. But it has a good story, amazing special effects, decent acting, and interesting characters. I recommend it, even if your not a star wars fan."
"Apr 01, 2011",2.5,the movie had an interesting plot but it is too much of a romance flick and was the fallout of the series
"Mar 31, 2011",2.5,"Found it rather boring at parts, but still alright and a good improvement over Phantom Meance.  Battle scenes were really good also."
"Mar 31, 2011",3.5,Attack Of The Clones is better than The Phantom Menace. Not by much though.
"Mar 30, 2011",4,"An upgrade from Phantom Menace because of better action and graphics, but it ultimately focuses on nothing but special effects. It has some great scenes, but far too many are unnecessary."
"Mar 29, 2011",3.5,"Not as good as the next four, but a step up from the previous one in terms of plot. Character development still needs work."
"Mar 29, 2011",2,Lesson to all men. Apparently you can whine at a woman until she'll love you.
"Mar 29, 2011",3.5,No Jaar Jaar...good riddance!
"Mar 28, 2011",2,"What a horrible shame to the Star Wars saga.  The film follows the story of Anakin Skywalker and his trip to one day become Darth Vader.  The plot is so worthless and a sorry excuse of how the Clone Wars began, I was bored the whole time and to make things worse it doesn't add anything to the series other than Count Dooku and Anakin and Padme getting married.  The cast seemed determined to make this film suck, espically Hayden Christensen, who was too horrible for words, and in my opinion the only good acors were Samuel L Jackson and Ewan Mcgregor.  Effects were okay but its Star Wars, they all had great effects in my opinion.  It was a terrible film and I hated it."
"Mar 27, 2011",2.5,"though this COULD HAVE BEEN so much better, i'm pretty confident in the fact that this was the best of the prequels."

intro continued in this link:
http://www.starwars.com/games/playnow/crawl_creator/index.jsp?cs=323z6a74um


Plot: okay so the republic is in trouble because some systems decide to become independent from it. the senate puts up a vote as to whether or not form an army that will protect the republic from these systems now called the separatists. Padme, now a senator, as recently survived an assassination attempt and is now currently being protected by Obi-wan &amp; Anakin. during this whole thing, anakin &amp; padme begin to fall in love while finding out who is killing her leads tot he discovery of the clone army and eventually the clone wars.

Acting:
Hayden Christensen/Anakin Skywalker: very bad character. simple as that. he's stubborn, arrogant, and doesn't say any good lines to get to padme. it just doesn't make sense that she falls in love with him. i mean in one hand we don't care as long as the story leads to the birth of the ever lovable Luke &amp; Leia, but seriously, imagine their thoughts if they ever found out how their parents fell in love. however i did really like that his part in the film involves telling how he's related to Uncle Owen and that he did get to see his mother one last time. nuthun wrong with that. 
Ewan McGregor/Obi-Wan Kenobi: now when i was younger i thought some the stuff he does in this movie was funny...then i got over it. now McGregor has some facial expressions. but still wasn't anything special.
Natalie Portman/Padme Amidala: this is where the down thoughts about portman generally comes into anyone's mind before Black Swan. i mean there are friends from my college who do not want to see Black Swan just because Portman is in it and they generally know her better from these movies. I mean she still did decent but she still wasn't the best.
Christopher Lee/Count Dooku: I liked his performance as Dooku. i thought he was a very lovable villain.

Editing:eh, just how it was suppose to be i suppose. i wouldn't really know.

Place in the saga: well while it's not the best movie you still need to enjoy that they at least begin to explain some things in the star wars series such as the stromtroopers, boba fett, and...sort of the love between luke &amp; leia's parents.

Action: it was good except for one major thing. yes you see an army of jedi fight, but that fight leads to two hundred jedi killed...that's pretty weak.

compared to the rest of the movies: now i actually think that this movie is the WORST of the saga and let me tell you why i say that rather than Phantom Menace. yes there's jar jar binks, but there isn't much focus on the romance between padme and anakin unlike this one. there's so much less excitement in the second one compared to phantom menace where there's even the pod race. and most importantly, while star wars was changed for the worse because of that midi-chlorians crap, at least that didn't make the jedi a little bit like wusses. i mean for over 20 years we only saw about two jedi at most with these films, and then there's this film where this one battle started with 200 jedi and about 15ish minutes later there's only 20 left. i mean it makes a little bit of sense concerning how they have droidakas and super battle droids in the battle but still, before, we only see jedi die either by sacrificing himself to halp other escape, dies of old age or in the hands of a sith more powerful. then you have these droids that were manhandled in the last film who kill a lot of jedi and the jedi have to be rescued by Clone troopers who later become STORMTROOPERS who are lucky hit so much as a BIRD!!! so phantom menace may have jar jar and midi-chlorians along with 2 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment, but at least they didn't have hundreds of jedi die. that's just pretty weak.

so that's my review for star wars: Attack of the Clones"
"Mar 27, 2011",1,"Possibly the worst thing to happen to Star Wars. Don't listen to that ""Better than the Phantom Menace"" crap. Terrible writing &amp; directing that would make any actor look bad. If you ever wondered what it would be like if two pieces of wood had a romantic relationship... watch this garbage."
"Mar 27, 2011",3,Too many scene changes in the beginning (very noticeable the way in which the scenes changes) but got better towards the end.
"Mar 26, 2011",1,"Luke, before I was your father, I was a whiny, obnoxious, teenager in a ridiculous situation with a woman who used to babysit me that continues the idea that the prequels were a bad idea."
"Mar 25, 2011",3,"A massive improvement over The Phantom Menace, and delivers way more better visual effects, that makes the Star Wars saga more fun again."
"Mar 24, 2011",2,"Far and away the worst movie in the Star Wars canon. Better off watching the Tartakovsky cartoons (2003). The acting is wooden, the plot is a mess, the romance is forced (no pun intended) and the war is cut short. Just not good."
"Mar 22, 2011",0.5,"Seriously, the worst star wars film or even the worst scifi, the worst space film ever"
"Mar 22, 2011",4.5,"Sure the acting's not IMPRESSIVE. We finally get to see the WARS in Star Wars. That counts for something, right?"
"Mar 21, 2011",2.5,"With the exception of the end of the movie, this was pretty bad. Just a boring movie all around."
"Mar 21, 2011",3.5,"This film is a definite improvement over the disappointing Episode I. There is a lot more action, plot development, and twists to the story. The focus on the romance between Anakin and Padme does add more depth to the character of Anakin. It also reveals some inner truths about Anakin and some foreshadowing of what paths he make take in the future. The clone war and the battle of Jedi is very well done. It becomes a great build up to the climactic battle against count Dooku. George Lucas tells a much better story in this film and makes this film feel more like the Star Wars films we've known to love."
"Mar 21, 2011",3,"Hey, if nothing else, it's the best of the new ones. Though it still has those painfully bad one-liners."
"Mar 21, 2011",3,"Non male, ma da un film di questa saga mi aspettavo di più."
"Mar 21, 2011",4,Best of the 3 prequels in my opinion
"Mar 18, 2011",0.5,How can rotten tomatoes call this an improvement? It's not. This is WORSE then episode 1. Everything looks fake and nothing feels real.
"Mar 17, 2011",3.5,"getting better, I like the action sequences between Obi-wan and Jengo Fett. Natalie Portman's acting sucks though! same with Hayden Christensen"
"Mar 16, 2011",5,Do I really need to explain why I gave it 5 out of 5
"Mar 14, 2011",3,"If I were to use one word to describe Attack of the Clones, that word would be improvement. While it is far from a perfect movie, it is an improvement over The Phantom Menace and thats pretty much all that can be said for it. I only hope that Revenge of the Sith will get me out of my prequel humdrum before I move on to the original trilogy, which are definitely the three superior films. The critics were entirely right, this does contain much more of what made the original trilogy fun, although the romance is quite grating and Hayden Christensen is only a little better than Jake Lloyd.

Attack of the Clones takes place ten years after the events of the first film, and the opening text says that Padme, no longer queen of Naboo, has to return to the senate to cast a vote on whether to build an army of the republic to protect against the now-existing separatist groups lead by the mysterious Count Dooku. An assassin named Jango Fett is trying to kill her for the exact same reason and Anakin has to take Padme back to Naboo for her saftey while Obi-Wan investigates what is behind all of this. Thats where the clone army comes in, which was ordered without authorization by a mysterious Jedi who was killed ten years ago. Add this to Anakin romancing Padme and it all culminates into an epic final battle with the clones.

The story isn't as lost as it is in Phantom Menace, and things are finally happening. Character development isn't that bad either, but what's really problematic in this movie is the romance between Anakin and Padme. Natalie Portman have little to no chemistry as a couple, and although the movie does end on a rather sweet note with their wedding, the rest of their romance is kind of grating, and its a big subplot for the first half of the film and it gets kind of annoying, like the romance between Will and Elizabeth in the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Anyway, that's the only major problem I have in the story, so I'll move on.

Character development is okay, but still is somewhat problematic. Anakin is now older and has shifted into the role of the main character. We also see shades of Darth Vader starting to come out, especially after the death of Anakin's mother. We also see the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which can be quite animous at times due to Anakin's arrogance and Obi-Wan's tradition. I wasn't really involved with the characters in this one, but I was a little more involved in this one. For those of you who are concerned, Jar Jar Binks is still in this one, but he's only in it for a little while, so the annoyance factor is minimal. 

The things that really improved were the acting and the visuals. The visual effects (creatures as well as backdrops) have certainly improved from the 1999 effects, and the performances have somewhat improved. For your information, I have no intention to see any of the Star Wars films in 3D, because 3D doesn't matter because you need to respect the special effects of that time, especially with the original trilogy. Anyway, the visuals were very impressive, much better than the first. 

Hayden Christensen is the only actor who I had problems with in this movie, because he's scarcely a better actor than Jake Lloyd, only much less annoying. Needless to say, he was probably the worst actor in the movie and I hope at least he's better in the third. The best was probably Ewan MacGregor as Obi-Wan followed by Christopher Lee as Count Dooku. They were both easily the best actors in the movie, and they give the best performances, although they give nothing spectacular. Natalie Portman was also okay, but she was never really spectacular in these movies anyway. The rest of the Jedis were okay as well. however, I doubt that one would watch these prequels for the acting, so lets move on.

The battle scenes were also fun and the final was probably one of the best battle scenes I've seen in a while. However, there was a lack of action in the first half, and thats another main problem with the movie. I would recommend this as a rental or to watch it for completion's sakes. However, watch The Phantom Menace and the original trilogy, because watching Phantom Menace will help along with the sotry, and the original trilogy are just better films. All in all, this is a huge improvement over the first one, but is nowhere near the greatness of the original trilogy."
"Mar 13, 2011",2.5,Anakin uses sand as a pick-up line *shudders* and this is supposed to be Darth Vader?  The same menacing Darth Vader that choked people just if they looked at him funny?
"Mar 12, 2011",3,"That ""rip-off"" feeling is absent here. It's an improvement, but I still thought it was a little blunt with its romantic obsessions and political mixture."

""LIFELESS, MISSING THE FORCE OR EVEN A PULSE""


Ah... ""STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES."" Um.... did ANYONE like this movie? Anyone, anywhere... ever? This one seems to be ranking right up there with his ""Howard the Duck."" 


But at least people had some kind of strong passion for that one. Any extreme movie (extreme in any way) is a likely candidate for the ""cult following."" But this one is just boring.


I wanted to kick it as hard as I could, not out of anger, but just to see if it's even alive.


If it is, it's flat-lining.


I remember when George Lucas announce that he was going to release the last three ""Star Wars"" movies (which ironically were the first three), the whole wide world jumped up. 


When ""Episode I"" was finally released, it was met with lukewarm reviews (from critics and fans alike). From the fair-weather to the hard-core, industrial strength fans. 


And everyone in between.


Many people ride Lucas and get on his case about his inability to write dialog (myself included).


Hey, let's face it. The man couldn't write dialog for a mime. Which is why he always hires a script doctor whenever he makes a film from his own screenplay. Hey, this is just called just plain common sense.


Many filmmakers try to re-make the kinds of movies that they first fell in love with when they were young. That not only applies to Lucas, he is the very definition of that. With futuristic Orwell tales (""THX 1138""), period action-adventure summer matinees (""Indiana Jones""), sci-fi space operas (""Star Wars,"" of course) and medieval sword-and-sorcery flicks (""Willow""). 



His abilities are in composing a movie lie in production values and state-of-the-art, groundbreaking, revolutionary special effects. Bringing everything about a genre together in one film and playing it to the hilt.


So Lucas brought on Jonathan Hales (""The Scorpion King"" and TV's ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"") as script doctor. Lucas' wise decision helped them take home the 2002 Razzie Award for Worst Screenplay. Hey, f--- the Oscars.


This was apparently the very first major-motion picture not to be shot on film, but on a special digital video movie camera that SONY designed specifically for Lucas himself.


I saw the movie on DVD, so being shot on digital video and being run on digital video disk, the movie was so sharp and so exact and so precise and so full of detail, I was amazed. When I saw ""Episode I"" in theaters, it didn't stand out this beautifully.


However, that momentary feeling eventually disintegrated and I was left with a feeling of indifference, then some boredom, then finally contempt.


The first released chapter in the ""Star Wars"" saga (Episode IV: A New Hope) showed a lot of the movie's themes came from old westerns and samurai pictures. In ""Episode II,"" I got the feeling the movie got a lot of it's inspiration from war movies. You know, ""Gettysburg"" and the like.


The could make for one hell of a little movie, except for the fact that this one is completely on Valium.


Break-taking visual scenery and first-rate FX (the entire movie was filmed in front of a blue screen) can't compensate for performances by actors who understandably seem have to have almost no love for a script that could have been written by a coma patient and a director who's far too assured that ""it'll all be fixed and filled out in editing and special effects later."" I know damned well Hayden Christensen is capable of acting. I've seen it. He seems to be channeling his role from ""Life As A House"" (no doubt that's why Lucas chose Christensen in the first place.


But the script and lack of direction seem to suck all the potential out of him. He never seems to be truly there at all.


Nor does scholar and sometimes-actress Natalie Portman. I feel kinda guilty saying this and all, but I never truly believed her as a action movie heroine in ""Episode I."" She just lacks that spunk and fire. You know, the kind that Carrie Fisher really had for almost every second she was on screen, especially when she shared scenes with Ford.


Portman simply can't do a Bridget Fonda or Pam Grier or Karen Allen. She's too sweet and vulnerable. Well, at least she seems more at home here. Although as sweet and beautiful as she is, there is no passion. Not in what she says or anything they do together.


They never seem to be in love so much as just sitting back practicing Shakespeare-style acting and mood for a theater performance.


It's nice to know good IL' Bobby Simone, yes--Jimmy Smits (Of TV's ""L.A. Law"" and NYPD Blue"" fame) is still out there and plugging away as an actor. He gets a bit in here as a Jedi Master on the council.


The only action sequences of any interest throughout take place when a Sith and Jedi masters have a powerful duel which leads to further hate and anger.


The dark side is claiming more and more Jedi by the second. 


And all this could've great for another great ""Star Wars"" classics. 


But the movie is has no life or energy. It seems almost indifferent. Like Lucas didn't have his heart (or anything else in this one).


He basically just wanted to get this one out of the way. The only thing he had in this movie is his wallet.


This whole damn movie feels like something he had to just something mandatory he had to get out of the way so he could bridge episodes I and III and continue with the rest of the series.


With the others, you know the filmmakers are giving it everything they had. Here... no one cares. Not even Lucas. 


And that's where every movie lives or dies....

"Mar 10, 2011",3,"Today, George Lucas is most infamous for coining cheesy phrases like, ""Just being around her is...intoxicating"" and instructing his actors to speak them with a startlingly degree of seriousness. But in all honesty, this flaw doesn't bother me. Clumsy acting and writing are hallmarks of even the best fanboy movies (see ""Batman Begins"") and over time they become endearing to their target audience because these flaws betray a certain vulnerable sincerity. And in a society where parody and sarcasm are rampant, sincerity must always be treasured.

That said, I believe Mr. Lucas' real crime is his obsession with creating elaborate digital battles and environments, and ""Attack of the Clones"" goes particularly awry in its final moments, in which the focus shifts from the movie's characters to armies of computer-created machines, which rage at each other soullessly across dusty battlefields. It's a loud and endless ordeal and it leaves you feeling bludgeoned.

This is a bitter disappointment because until then, the movie maintains an engaging narrative, bristling with engergy and poetry. The galaxy of Mr. Lucas' vivid immagination is on the brink of war and Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (an impossibly dignified Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen, memorably overstating each line) have been tasked with protecting Natalie Portman's Senator Amidala. 

It's a narrative riddled with holes and a gross moral oversights (as was pointed out in the excellent book ""Star Wars and Philosophy"", Amidala's reaction when she learns that Anakin was slaughtered an army of Tusken Raiders is highly inappropriate), but it provides an attractive blend of adventure, romance, and mystery. It falls to Obi-Wan to track down a number of Amidala's would be assassins through a series of dazzling gunfights (including a stunning chase through a maze of neon midnight traffic) and as the Senator and Anakin begin an illicit affair, cinematographer David Tattersall bathes them in sunlit lighting that is a once soft, delicate, and incredibly clear.

I need hardly mention that part of the reason I find these scenes enjoyable is being I am in fact a diehard ""Star Wars"" fan. True, I couldn't stomach this movie's predacessor (the grossly overdone,infantile ""Phantom Menace""), but save for that final battle, I love ""Attack of the Clones"". It's a film crafted with elegance, performed with both grace and clumsiness, and alive with leaps and laser bursts.

It's an adventure.
****:)"
"Mar 09, 2011",3,"Perhaps it should never have been released at all, but since it does, however I enjoyed it bit to pay homage to the Episode!"
"Mar 09, 2011",1.5,The combination of bad acting and terrible script make me want to gag throughout this entire movie.
"Mar 09, 2011",4,"again, Love it hate it

Action is awsome

Hayden Not"
"Mar 08, 2011",4,"My least favorite, though that isn't saying much. The lightsaber battles, the climax, and an impressive story (not so much ""lines"") make this a guilt-free movie to watch."
"Mar 07, 2011",3.5,"The story and characters are a little lacking, but the action scenes are great! The effects are good, but as with all of the prequels there is too much CG. The best things about this film are finally getting to see Yoda fight and Padme, if you know what i mean"
"Mar 07, 2011",5,"love yoda in fight scenes, subtle hints to future are well written like obi wan telling anikan that he feels one day he'll be the death of him..."
"Mar 06, 2011",3.5,The weakest of all the star wars.
"Mar 02, 2011",2.5,The dialogue between Anakin and Pandme is beyond painful
"Feb 27, 2011",5,Chick flick trapped in a Star Wars flim makes up for it by an awesome battle scene on Geonosis
"Feb 27, 2011",3,This is my least favorite Star Wars film.
"Feb 27, 2011",3,wasnt a huge fan of this one
"Feb 27, 2011",4.5,"I consider this a step forward from The Phantom Menace as it steps into a much darker storyline involving Anakin starting his journey to the dark side. Also, the film featured plenty of intense action sequences that are highlighted by outstanding visual effects. I also liked how they explain the origin of Boba Fett even though they could have touch on him more. The film's major flaws is its cases of awkward dialogue and moments of wooden acting. Those didn't destroy the movie for me because it is yet another significant entry into the franchise in terms of the story. Also because there is plenty of visually stunning action to behold."
"Feb 25, 2011",2.5,"Without question, this is my least favorite of the six Star Wars films.  Truth be told, it has little to do with the story itself, which is typically the major selling point with me in movies.  The story in Attack of the Clones was stronger, overall, than Episode I (though it likewise made several mistakes).  No, the main thing that makes this Star Wars film the weakest amongst its brethren is dialogue.  Laughable, god-awful dialogue.
The most obvious offenses in the vocal department are from Natalie Portman and Hayden Christianson (not sure if I spelled that right, but is he important enough to care?).  Lines like ""You're in my very soul tormenting me."" would make Romeo and Juliet vomit.  Some lines belong in conversation, some in poetry.  Most of Anakin's and Padme's dialogue belongs in neither.
Other vocal errors belong only to Darth Hayden.  George Lucas proves for the second film in a row that his approach with young Vader was all wrong.  Rather than making a character who's wisdom matches his immense skill, we get a petulant child.  There's a scene where Anakin we see Anakin enraged at his mother's death, and he begins killing the Sandpeople who are responsible.  We later find that he slaughtered the entire camp.  This is actually a good idea, but the childish rant Anakin gives to Padme afterwards is whiny and silly and culminates into what accidentally turns out to be a punchline to the bad joke: he throws an object that gives a quiet, dull clank.  Aren't scenes of rage better off ending in some form a violence or destruction?  In Episode III Anakin's rage results in him smashes things via the Force and causing the Death Star itself to tremor.  But his mother dying apparently only warrants the hollow clatter of a can.  At least it was funny though.
The final thing I'll bemoan about the dialogue is the use of puns.  Lots and lots of puns.  C-3PO uses several during a battle scene, none of which are funny and all of which are annoying.  All that's missing are the rim shots.
As I said earlier, the story in Episode II isn't bad at all, though there is one serious misfire.  About half way through the film we are introduced to Count Dooku (played excellently by Christopher Lee), the leader of the Seperatist Movement.  There is a scene with him and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) where Dooku informs him that the Senate is being controlled by a Sith Lord, and that he must be stopped.  So it would seem, at that point, that Dooku's reasons for leading a Seperatist Movement are just and right, but then we find out he's in league with the Sith Lord (making one wonder why he told Obi-Wan this at all).  It was an intriguing idea to have a former Jedi in the gray, but the idea is dropped.
Ultimately, the faults with Episode II boil down to execution.  Lucas' idea of the young Darth Vader is still far too silly to enjoy, and his actors are given dialogue that makes the mute button all to tempting.  The special effects are excellent as always and there's plenty of fun to be had, but so many of the characters (both new and old) are too painful to watch.  When you're rolling your eyes during a climactic battle sequence of Star Wars, you know something isn't right."
"Feb 24, 2011",3.5,"The love story aspects are long and boring.  Was excited cuz Hayden Christensen was my boy back then due to Higher Ground, but he disappointed in movie.  Prolly cuz writing was bad.  Full of action, but kinda pointless.  Like it anyway cuz it Star Wars.  Grew up on Star Wars, can't be helped."
"Feb 24, 2011",2.5,"Still disappointing, but getting better."
"Feb 22, 2011",1,"A lot of people think that Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is a little better than Episode I: The Phantom Menace.  And I can kind of see why they would say that. The Phantom Menace had no main character and all of the characters in it were completely boring. And then in this one we get a little more depth, but what's so funny is that this attempt of a love story is actually less barable than the characters having no character at all. The Phantom Menace made you shake your head in disappointment because the character development, script and plot were all wrong, but with Attack of the Clones, you shake your head sure, but you also are annoyed and groan.

The reason you groan is because....ugh well let me start from the very beginning of the film. 

ÃÃ,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Â¢,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Â¬  First we see some ship exploding unexpectedly and there is a death. ""Hey this might be pretty good...no wait, I'm still bored because I don't care about that person thanks to The Phantom Menace. ""

ÃÃ,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Â¢,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Â¬. Then ""Hey Obi Wan and Anakin are in an elevator and Anakin isn't the annoying kid from Jingle All the Way anymore. Hey, this might be pretty good....wait no here comes Jar Jar. Now Anakin is expressing his anger to Jar Jar. AGGHH!!

ÃÃ,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Â¢,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Â¬. Alright! A really cool speeder chase. This isn't boring?? Wha the fuck?

ÃÃ,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Â¢,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Ã,Â¬. About 30 minutes later Anakin winds up with Padme on a beautiful looking planet and ""NOOOO the diolauge is getting worse and worse! I'm not believing this. This is horrible. This sucks! NOO

Yes that one speeder chase was so impressive and the love between Padme and Anakin was so unimaginably stupid that the points are going so low it's like that speeder chase never happened.

What's so ironic about this is that the love between Han Solo and Princess Leia in The Empire Strikes Back was so impressive and believable, and it was probably one of the best love stories I've ever seen. Attack of the Clones is one of the worst I've ever seen.

Now, when Anakin and Padme are together there is not a single line of dialoge that I haven't already heard before...oh wait, Anakin at one point says ""Your skin is soft. Not like sand. Sand is hard and unpleasant to be around. Not like your skin"". The only original line of dialogue was THAT! Probably the dumbest line I've ever heard in my life!  Theres been a lot of talk about this line, almost as much as Han shooting first in Episode IV. But I really do think that the ""sand"" line might just be the worst line I've ever heard in a movie.  

A lot of people say this movie has bad acting. I don't think it's the acting at all. It's the script! It's the script!  Not even Marlon Brando could read these shitty lines!  GEORGE!! What the hell were you thinking?! GEORGE!!  

Attack of the Clones ultimately fails as a movie. Almost everything that happens in it is completely anti-climactic, unsatisfying, and boring.  Which is mainly why these movies don't work. 

I just don't see how anyone can like this! It's just so...URRRRGG MAKE IT STOP!!! NO NO NO NOOOO!!!!!  

Anakin: I killed them all! Every last one of them! 

Me: Shut the fuck up you.....you....imbecile!"
"Feb 21, 2011",1.5,"lol at this script. Awful, but the action is okay, and I really liked it when I was like 8 soo"
"Feb 20, 2011",4,Infelizmente romance pra cacete e pouco yoda sonic
"Feb 20, 2011",3.5,Not a step above or below of the Phantom Menace. Attack of the Clones is a good sequel to a prequel. Ewan McGregor is still great as Obi Wan now a jedi knight. Hayden Christiensen i found to be perfectly casted as Anakin you can tell he is troubled and has darkness in him. Christopher Lee is great as Count Dooku/Darth Tyrannous. The plot is interesting and its battle scenes are quite well filmed.
"Feb 20, 2011",1.5,Contains some of the most cringe-worthy dialogue in the history of film.
"Feb 19, 2011",5,The second StarWars film. Anakin experiences a few setbacks and the dark force surfaces and challenges the Jedi.
"Feb 18, 2011",1,Disappointing on many levels.
"Feb 17, 2011",4,This is a good improvement over the Phantom Menice but..is not the best in the serries having said that though it is a very enjoyable film and I have always liked the chemestry between Anikian and laya.
"Feb 16, 2011",3.5,"Hayden Christianson is awful.  He is worse than Jar JAr Binks for me.  The kid can't act and combine that with Lucas' classically bad dialogue, you have a disaster of a love scene.  Jango Fett and AGAIN Obiwan save this movie.  The battle scenes were pretty cool too.  Oh yes and Yoda goes crazy.  Gotta love that."
"Feb 15, 2011",2,"This was the worst of the Star Wars saga.  To me, this seemed like a filler movie.  There was no purpose to it at all!"
"Feb 15, 2011",5,Not a bad film had a few nice battle scenes in it. They really should have made them the right way round that way we could have gone from mildly disappointed to absolutely wowed but instead we have it the other way round.
"Feb 14, 2011",5,Absolutely love the new series.
"Feb 14, 2011",3.5,I've watch this over and over again...still i have to watch from sixth...
"Feb 14, 2011",1,"""I love the sand""
""I hate the sand""

I'm not shitting you, that was the dialogue before the first kiss of the movie"
"Feb 13, 2011",1,I can't stand this movie.
"Feb 12, 2011",1,THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS JANGO FETT...HE DIED TOO FAST. NUFF SAID.
"Feb 12, 2011",3,"Anakin Skywalker: You call this a diplomatic solution?
PadmÃ (C) Amadala: No. I call this aggressive negotiations. 

Could've been better if it wasn't that slow."
"Feb 12, 2011",2,"You try to convince yourself that you should like it, but, really....you dont.
Acting sucks, dialog sucks, the plot is stillborn. Effects are not enough and even then, more is not better."
"Feb 11, 2011",2.5,"The fan reaction to Jar-Jar was so furious after the first movie that Lucas had to practically wipe the hapless Gungan out in the second chapter of the saga. 
Poor Lucas! He must have felt like that writer in ""Misery""  being forced to rewrite his novel at the hands of a psychotic fan."
"Feb 10, 2011",0.5,"Contrive, disgusting flower talk, pointless plot-lines and insufferable blandness, At least Phantom menace had genuine ingenuity to it, this is just sloppy work all around."
"Feb 09, 2011",3,Unbelievable romance and an uninteresting plot up until the last third of the movie make it 'okay'.
"Feb 09, 2011",3,"These attempts to give us a deeper insight into what happened before the original story,ans actually this entire prequel series is for an unexplained reason ruining the atmosphere of the original series for me.The quality of the CGI may be improved,but this makes it look as fake as possible.I really am interested in Darth Vader's making but the way this whole story is woven is really disappointing and not that on point.Surely I have to admit that this movie includes some really amazing and wonderful scenes which gave me the chills and the reason to honour it with 3 stars.I really am looking forward to the sequel series,but I really do hope it will be more true to the original and far more well made."
"Feb 08, 2011",4.5,"Flawed only by the less-than-stellar romantic subplot, ""Clones"" succeeds greatly in delivering the thrills, visual splendor, and escapism that we crave...the part with Yoda at the end was pretty FREAKING AWESOME."
"Feb 08, 2011",3,É imperdível...faz parte da saga.
"Feb 07, 2011",3,"Although this was a slight upgrade from Episode I with the additions of Hayden Christensen and the withdraw of Jar-Jar. However, this edition of Star Wars does not reach the ares of greatest that the original saga. 

The story is rather boring and not full. There are, of course, reasons for this. The first two Star Wars films from the second saga have clearly been made to step up the climax of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. 

The addition of Hayden Christensen is much better than a young Jake Lloyd. However, his acting skills are completely raw at the point of this film. He had limited experience up to this point. 

The film is well-made with state of the art effects. One of the worst things that this film attempts to do is create a CGI Yoda. It was needed to have him fight, which was both hilarious and cool. But, it typifies the cheesiness that is present in new saga."
"Feb 06, 2011",4,starting to get real good now just what we were waiting for. brilliant.
"Feb 05, 2011",3,Not as bad as I remember it being. That's not saying much though.
"Feb 01, 2011",2,worst star wars ever!
"Jan 31, 2011",2,Terrible a horrible follow up to episode 1 it had good action yes but it was too much about Luke and Padme which I didnt like didnt cary the true spirit of the star wars films
"Jan 30, 2011",3,"After the large disappointment called The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones brings out the better of the Star Wars trilogy."
"Jan 27, 2011",5,"Same with Episode I, I was a youngling when this one hit theatres and loved this movie so much, especially the badass finale. One thing is for certain though, Hayden Christensen can't act to save his life."
"Jan 27, 2011",2,"My least favorite Star Wars movie.  The dialog is plentiful, but action is rare.  If you like the other Star Wars movies, you'll hate this one."
"Jan 27, 2011",3,This for me is the worst film out of the star wars saga.
"Jan 27, 2011",4,I love all the Star Wars movies cause of the story :)
"Jan 26, 2011",2.5,I love Star Wars but I was disappointed with the dialog in this film and the story progressed too quickly.
"Jan 25, 2011",3.5,"It provides necessary character development I guess, but it's still the low point of the series, well, besides ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars""..."
"Jan 24, 2011",1.5,I liked this one in theaters... but I think I just wanted to like it so that I'd still have hope for Episode III.
"Jan 24, 2011",3,"The action's pretty good but the love story drags a bit.
Also, Yoda's fight with Dooku was a bit disappointing..."
"Jan 24, 2011",1.5,The worst of the prequels.  Shockingly bad continuity gaffes and sloppy writing.  Laugh-out-loud bad in several places.  Make it stop!
"Jan 24, 2011",2,"It's ironic how, in this movie, Boba Fett's the clone and Jango Fett's the original."
"Jan 23, 2011",3.5,"79%

I can't stand Hayden Christensen's whining Anikin. And the romance between Hayden and Portman felt completly forced and shitty. The ""worst"" in the crappy prequels."

"Jan 22, 2011",0.5,"Worst lines in the history of film, this movie makes me so angy, I can't even begin."
"Jan 22, 2011",3.5,"Grrr, I hated the whole Anakin-Padme plotline, isn't she like 20 years older than him? Anyways, this is still a solid movie and I continue to enjoy it. The Blu-ray restoration is top-notch, but that's expected for the more recent films. Note: I loved this even more on my second Blu-ray viewing. After another viewing, maybe I'll actually come to love this movie."
"Jan 21, 2011",1,"Attack of the Clones is a joyless CGI-fest, a clunky love story, and an action-figure advertisement."
"Jan 21, 2011",0.5,None of this movie makes sense.
"Jan 20, 2011",1.5,I have nothing to say about this atrocity.
"Jan 19, 2011",3,"the worst part of the movie is when Ani(jedi)
is of 5 yrs old at that time queen is of nearly 
20 yrs old .queen take care Ani has a baby and take cares
about him.After few years when Ani becomes young
the queen and Ani fall in love..what the F*** it is.

In which order do you watch them?"
"Jan 17, 2011",5,One of my Favorite SciFi Movies of all Time.
"Jan 16, 2011",3.5,"Personally, I love this movie. The action was cool, Jango Fett was a boss and Yoda was in a fight? I think its quite an improvement over Phantom Menace. This was a bit more adult and honestly reminded me of Empire. Not a perfect film, the love story needed more work, but hey, I'll take it."
"Jan 16, 2011",0.5,"God this is awful. The script, granted is dire but even with a decent script Hayden Christensen is possible the worst actor on the face of the earth, and I've watched Hollyoaks. Watching him trying to convey emotion is painful and he just comes across as a spoilt child. Which is fine as he's supposed to be a frustrated  young Jedi but you could never believe Padme would fall in love with a whinging baby like him.

As with Episode I Lucas's direction is woeful. He can't seem to let a scene run for more than a minute before cutting to something else, cutting back, then cutting away again, it really spoils the flow of the film.

Surprisingly the special effects in some areas  leave a lot to be desired. In some parts the green screening is very bad, I think Who Framed Roger Rabbit was done better. In fact the original three look far better than this dross. 

Unlike the first film where the final light sabre battle was worth the wait, this one, sadly is not. Hayden Christensen just stands there and gets his arse handed to him by Christopher Lee. He literally holds his arm out while Lee does a doddery 360 and cuts it off. Then the fight between Dooku and Yoda is like watching an old man trying to swat a fly. The whole thing has had no real thought put into it whatsoever. Lucas must have thought I'll get them to wave their light sabre's about and spin around a lot, that'll impress them."
"Jan 16, 2011",2,"Okay, except for the scenes only included in order to justify the computer game tie-in."
"Jan 15, 2011",1.5,"Terrible. Really, just not good."
"Jan 15, 2011",0.5,"The script is a rushed, incoherent mess. Why does someone who can change their face to disguise themselves, need to wear a disguise? Why are the Jedi taking no actions to protect Padme at all? Why are 2 people who are forbidden to love each other sent to spend months in hiding TOGETHER? What did Anakin ever do to win over Padme besides killing children and supporting a dictatorship? Ugh... Is there a magic potion that makes you forget about these movies?"
"Jan 15, 2011",1,"Hate the prequel series. Hate it, hate it, hate it.

Even Sam Jackson does warrant it a good rating."
"Jan 14, 2011",3.5,Very well done.  Great special effects and good story.
"Jan 14, 2011",2,Only a little better than Menace.
"Jan 14, 2011",4,"An improvement, but then again, STORY!! The end.
Rating: 7.8/10"
"Jan 14, 2011",3,"""Attack of the Clones"" maintains the height and visual wonderment of the saga."
"Jan 13, 2011",3,Boring boring romance that is boring and more boring. Not as much fighting until the end did not care for this movie again another descent sequel. C+
"Jan 12, 2011",3,"probably the weaker point of the saga, but at least the former Dracula's in it!"
"Jan 10, 2011",2.5,Not nearly as good as Episode I
"Jan 10, 2011",3,The love scenes in this movie is so hysterically bad and the movie has a lot of boring parts but the ending is really cool and seeing Yoda fight was awesome.  Overall this is better than Episode 1 but that's not saying much cause they're both pretty lame.
"Jan 09, 2011",4,"Again, I liked the new trilogy just fine. Especially this one."
"Jan 09, 2011",3.5,"To me, Episode 2 stays on pace and maybe slows down a bit from the Phantom Menace. The action is great with some stunning CG sequences, especially when Yoda flexes the saber skills. Christopher Lee is a huge addition here and Sam Jackson is powerful as well. Yes Hayden Christensen is painful to watch sometimes, especially when his scenes are stolen by bit actors with two lines. They were really just biding time until Episode 3."
"Jan 06, 2011",0.5,"If I could have given this movie a zero, I would have. More of a confusing fuddy-duddy mess than The Phantom Menace, Attack is needlessly boring, inept and poorly scripted. Dare I say it showcases how CGI does NOT create an interesting plot with relatable characters.  Also, the romance between Anakin and Padme was completely forced. Anakin Skywalker, you are no James Bond."
"Jan 06, 2011",3,"This star wars movie is the second worst of all time. Some major improvements over episode one were very nice to see. Most notably the virtual elimination of Jar Jar Binks and Gungans in general for that matter, from the star wars universe. This process is all but finalized in the third movie. There are some really cool action sequences and we get a quick peek into Boba Fett and how he started. Some great fighting throughout and we finally get to see Yoda fight wich everyone had been waiting years for and it was glorious. However, Hayden Christensen was very annoying for most of this movie. Gets much better in Episode 3 but in this one, he is almost as annoying as Jake lloyd in Episode 1. Overall, an improvement on Episode 1, but still at the bottom of the star wars scale. 6.6/10"
"Jan 04, 2011",3,"So much better than Phantom Menace. Still not good. Still plagued by shitty writing. I really like McGregor as Obi-Wan and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine, but mostly everyone else is pretty awful, especially Christensen. The love story is boring and not very believable. There's more action this time around though &amp; visually it's still cool, maybe a little more interesting than the first plot wise. Not great, but an improvement."
"Jan 03, 2011",2.5,"Out of all the movies, all six, this is the weakest. It had it's moments( yoda kicking ass!) but it wasn't too great."
"Jan 03, 2011",3,"Three stars- which means that I can at least enjoy it.  The love story needed to be developed better, especially the dialogue."
"Jan 03, 2011",4,"A vast improvement on Episode 1 (The Phantom Turd) and probably my 3rd favourite of the 6 movie saga. Some dodgy dialogue and an unexpressive monotone Hayden Christensen aside, AOTC delivers the requisite action and thrills. The complex political machinations are probably too confusing but at least all the boring tax and trade embargo waffle from the previous episode has been jettisoned out of the airlock. Visually the film is a treat. At times scenes on Naboo and Coruscant are just gorgeous to look at; Fine art compositions of model work and CGI. Christopher Lee adds some gravitas and Ewan McGregor now confidently portrays Obi-Wan Kenobi (the blu-ray release means that the fight between Kenobi and Jango Fett is now uncut in the UK). Lastly, old master Yoda gets to kick ass!"
"Jan 03, 2011",3.5,"good sequel, OK story line, likable acting came out pretty good!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Jan 03, 2011",1.5,Worse than the Phantom Menace.  Why?  The forced and boring love story between Anakin and Padme.
"Jan 02, 2011",4,hard not to compare it to the origonals but if you can get over the fact that the characters and sound effects are the only real influence they used then its an alright movie.....kind of slow and probably the worste in the series but still good
"Jan 02, 2011",4,everyone wanted to like these movies. this one is probably the worste but if you can get over how differnt it was from the amazing origonals then its an alright movie. some of the cg is a little to much and you dont really care about any of the characters and they are all boring. the movie doesnt get going untill near the end so its hard to stay awake. its till really good it just would have been better if they stayeed more faithfull to the origonals
"Jan 02, 2011",4,"Slowly getting better.....again, its a Star Wars film so I genetically have to love it."
"Jan 01, 2011",4.5,"Sure there are plenty of ways to criticize this movie as compared to the other five installments but when you compare it to the rest of what Hollywood produces, it rises above the crowd. In this classic tale of good vs. bad (and good-gone-bad) we're introduced to a lightsaber wielding Yoda and the adult Anakin--the center of the Star Wars universe--making those time worn coming-of-age decisions: love, family, career, higher-power. Not only does this movie entertain kids of all ages but it holds up well to repeat viewings and earns the right to be called a classic. 6/6/9"
"Dec 31, 2010",5,"I've always wanted to see how Padme Amidala and Anakin got together because of love them together AND apart but mostly the first so I'm really honored to finally get the chance in this movie and even though I know it (their love story) now, I still come back to watch the movie along with the great fights that is involved :)"
"Dec 31, 2010",1,"oh dear, someone tell him.."
"Dec 31, 2010",2,Not bad..... just not good either
"Dec 30, 2010",5,almost as good as the phantom menace
"Dec 30, 2010",2,"Better than episode one, but honestly is that supposed to mean anything?"
"Dec 29, 2010",3.5,Good film. Lots of action
"Dec 29, 2010",2.5,"Whilst still being 'Star Wars', this introduces a bit more characterisation. Anakin has a dual personality, which renders it difficult to think of him as 'just goodie' or 'just baddie'. An improvement on the older installments (where the characterisation is too simplistic)"
"Dec 29, 2010",4,Star wars is a classical saga that everyone should to watch.
"Dec 28, 2010",3.5,It's only good for the action. That's all I have to say.
"Dec 27, 2010",3,"Fun and often thrilling (mostly during the last third), but the usual bad dialouge, acting, characterization, and leaden pacing keep this near soulless film from soaring."
"Dec 26, 2010",4,obiwan s performance from Mr mcgregor is perfect... and this is my fav out of the prequels personal opinion
"Dec 25, 2010",2,"You know, I can't believe I'm saying this and I know I'll get burned alive for doing so but...PLEASE BRING JAKE LLOYD BACK!!"
"Dec 25, 2010",2.5,Not as bad as most people claimed but still not up to value with the first trilogy.
"Dec 23, 2010",2,"Stupid dialogue, good action."
"Dec 22, 2010",3,Slight Improvement over the First. This film is Actually Watchable
"Dec 22, 2010",4,Hayden and Natalie scenes are utterly unwatchable. Everything else is executed slightly better than Menace. Sound design and some visual effects are impressive as one would expect from Lucasfilm production.
"Dec 21, 2010",2,This movie is a mess of GD and terrible acting.
"Dec 20, 2010",3,A little bit better than episode I.
"Dec 20, 2010",3.5,"This film looks the fakest. The arena scene, and the founding of Boba Fett save this movie"
"Dec 20, 2010",2.5,The second-worst Star Wars Film.
"Dec 19, 2010",0.5,"There are few movies in the world I cannot stand, and this is one of them. How the hell do you make something even worse than the Phantom Menance? Well, this is how...

The CGI indulgence is worse, the boring characterization is even worse (Aside from Ewen Mcgregor of course), the story is even more convoluted, yet shallow, and then there is that infamous 'romance' subplot. Ow...my brain...!"
"Dec 19, 2010",2,"Marginally better than Phantom Menace, but the romantic subplot with its cringe-inducing dialogue gets tiresome. Fast."
"Dec 19, 2010",3,"My least favorite star wars movie, despite the all the fanfare. CG Yoda was just not quite there yet..."
"Dec 18, 2010",3,"Attack Of The Clones is a step above Phantom Menace. However the film is peppered with cheesy dialogue which brings the film down a notch. As you might have guessed or not, this is the film where Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala fall in love. We get a glimpse of how people fall in love in space, and man its embarrassing. The dialogue between both characters is very painful to hear. But thats not what makes this film good. The films strength lies within the use of special effects. The two principal actors (Portman and Christensen) aren't that great to watch on screen. But the battle sequences in the film are action packed and definitely thrill. However the weakest link in the film is Christensen and Portman. Both actors dialogue are very wooden, and seem to be overacted and its really what makes this film lose some points in my book. I understand that we need to know how Luke and Leia came to be, but the love scenes in the film were really lame and cheesy. Love scenes in a chick flick are less cheesy than the scenes we were presented with in Attack Of The Clone. Oh well, at least the origin  of Luke and Leia has been explained, mind you in not such a unique way. Natalie Portman is the weakest cast member in this film, and she has played far superior  roles than this film. Attack Of The Clones lacks a great story that we Star Wars fans are used, and instead George Lucas bombards us with a special effects fest A la Michael Bay. The action scenes are very interesting and top notch, but the film lacks the flavor of the classic Star Wars trilogy. Only its follow up film, Revenge Of The Sith was much better, and closer to the traditional Star Wars formula that fans  have come to love of the original films. Whatever you're feelings might be about Attack Of The Clones, rest assured that it's much better than The Phantom Menace, and thats saying something."
"Dec 18, 2010",3,"Not the worst of the franchise, and much better than the Phantom Menace, but Lucas forgets what made the originals so much fun! He lacks in the romance that made us care for Leia and Solo so much. He lacks in the development in this movie's heros Anakin and Obi Won. But still, this is an improvement. It felt more like a Star Wars movie than the forced piece of crap known as The Phantom Menace. The direction, script, and plot is smoother. The characters feel more real in these troubled times. It seems to go together with 4,5,6 much smoother. But its still not Star Wars. It still seems so forced, and the romance is really laughable. Its boring, and it can be dull. So despite a few good things, it still has many bads. 6/10"
"Dec 18, 2010",5,"Brilliant!! Character structure awesome... You see the moment Annakin turns to the Dark Side... His mothers death, anger at the Jedi's for not allowing him to save her... Yes, the force is strong with this one but which side..."
"Dec 17, 2010",1.5,"Better than ""The Phantom Menace,"" but still pretty much crap."
"Dec 16, 2010",3.5,I returned to the old formula of what a new hope felt like. It also introduced me to jango.
"Dec 15, 2010",3,"Decent film, but Christensen's acting is absolutely awful."
"Dec 14, 2010",0.5,"So it's ""better"" (more like less horrible) than Episode 1 because there's not as much Jar Jar or annoying little kids, although this movie has both, just not in the deafening magnitude of Ep. 1. 

Also there's not nearly the inappropriately timed, desperate slapstick humor of Ep. 1, where Lucas and the producers must have decided a scene (or whole movie) was getting boring (it was) so they had to add fart jokes or have an alien make a funny face (didn't help).

But there's also the usual glaring flaws (plot makes no damn sense, Anakin is a whiny, creepy brat who Natalie Portman would never fall in love with or marry, lazy plot devices like Anakin being sent basically to a weekend getaway retreat with Padme for no real reason, the Jedi Council being a bunch of incompetent morons who couldn't sense an earthquake while it was happening). 

At the end of the movie I don't really know what happened or why it mattered. During it, I can't tell and don't care.  For the big battles there's too much on the screen and nothing to care about. Sometimes you can't even tell which side blew up. Why would you care anyway??

In the space chases we see no barriers of physics or gravity, and the suspense of belief just informs us that nothing bad can really happen to the heroes. It's all just part of the huge giant tractor beam of turning Anakin into Darth Vader! They could have made ANYTHING else happen in the meantime and this is what we get? This story just did not need to be told! I keep thinking ""OK, the Jedi Council stuff is really boring and lame, but I guess maybe that's how they're supposed to be so it's not really a bad thing. Wait a minute, then why make a bunch of movies about boring space politics? This sucks!""  It's like listening to NPR news about countries that don't even exist.  There's a way to do it. This isn't it. 

So besides just being a bad movie on its own, the other glaring issue is the same as from Episode 1:  THE COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS. Yoda does backflips and fights with a light saber (in Empire Strikes Back he says the force is never to be used for attack, ""wars make not one great""), and Obi-wan tells Anakin ""this weapon is your life,"" the weapon being the lightsaber, of course!!   

Yoda didn't even train Luke with a lightsaber in Empire Strikes Back! He tells him his weapons won't be necessary!  Can you picture any of that happening in the new movies? 

OK fine, they're NEW star wars movies so they don't have to be like the old ones, but to me this is like making ""The Hobbit"" and Bilbo is a badass with sunglasses and maybe even rides a crude medieval-type motorcycle.  

Just like in Ep. 1 where we have ""Midiclorians"" determining who was born to be a jedi, rather than being something supernatural and of faith, we got Yoda bouncing like a superball making stupid yoda noises and fighting with a light saber. This totally defeats the whole purpose of Yoda even being a funny little green guy in the first place, the whole idea that your size AND strength are not what matter. 

Those things alone would probably be enough for me to hate this movie, but add the atrociously wooden acting and boring action scenes (the non-action scenes are just as boring) and it's one of my least favorite ever."
"Dec 13, 2010",2.5,"The story improved, but wow this film is boring to watch. Thanks to its bland characters, poor acting, and brutal pacing."
"Dec 13, 2010",3,kalau saja scene romance ala india dan jar jar bink dihilangkan
"Dec 11, 2010",3.5,"Pew Pew, Future space battles and crap!"
"Dec 09, 2010",4,the love story was frikikin annoying.  Jar jar was still about.  Special effect were great.  Bah
"Dec 09, 2010",2,"Very pretty, but I think I like Episode I better.  (I know that isn't a popular opinion...)"
"Dec 08, 2010",0.5,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Even besides that fact that the prequel trilogy is an insult to the original films, the movie in particular stands out as a truly awful movie. The fact that it has a 66% makes me lose faith in all movie critics."
"Dec 08, 2010",4,I remember seeing this movie in theaters 8 years ago and it was great. I also have the one like Episode I - The Phantom Menace on VHS. Bottom line it's much better than the forst one.

""LIFELESS, MISSING THE FORCE OR EVEN A PULSE""


Ah... ""STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES."" Um.... did ANYONE like this movie? Anyone, anywhere... ever? This one seems to be ranking right up there with his ""Howard the Duck."" 


But at least people had some kind of strong passion for that one. Any extreme movie (exterme in any way) is a likely candidate for the ""cult following."" But this one is just boring.


I wanted to kick it as hard as I could, not out of anger, but just to see if it's even alive.


If it is, it's flat-lining.


I remember when George Lucas announce that he was going to release the last three ""Star Wars"" movies (which ironically were the first three), the whole wide world jumped up. 


When ""Episode I"" was finally released, it was met with lukewarm reviews (from critics and fans alike). From the fair-weather to the hard-core, industrial strength fans. 


And everyone in between.


Many people ride Lucas and get on his case about his inability to write dialog (myself included).


Hey, let's face it. The man couldn't write dialog for a mime. Which is why he always hires a script doctor whenever he makes a film from his own screenplay. Hey, this is just called just plain common sense.


Many filmmakers try to re-make the kinds of movies that they first fell in love with when they were young. That not only applies to Lucas, he is the very definition of that. With futuristic Orwell tales (""THX 1138""), period action-adventure summer matinées (""Indianda Jones""), sci-fi space operas (""Star Wars,"" of course) and medieval sword-and-sorcery flicks (""Willow""). 



His abilities are in composing a movie lie in production values and state-of-the-art, groundbreaking, revolutionary special effects. Bringing everything about a genre together in one film and playing it to the hilt.


So Lucas brought on Johnathan Hales (""The Scropian King"" and TV's ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"") as script doctor. Lucas' wise decision helped them take home the 2002 Razzie Award for Worst Screenplay. Hey, f--- the Oscars.


This was apparently the very first major-motion picture not to be shot on film, but on a special digital video movie camera that SONY designed specifically for Lucas himself.


I saw the movie on DVD, so being shot on digital video and being run on digital video disk, the movie was so sharp and so exact and so precise and so full of detail, I was amazed. When I saw ""Episode I"" in theaters, it didn't stand out this beautifully.


However, that momentary feeling eventually disintegrated and I was left with a feeling of indifference, then some boredom, then finally contempt.


The first released chapter in the ""Star Wars"" saga (Episode IV: A New Hope) showed a lot of the movie's themes came from old westerns and samurai pictures. In ""Episode II,"" I got the feeling the movie got a lot of it's inspiration from war movies. You know, ""Gettysburg"" and the like.


The could make for one hell of a little movie, except for the fact that this one is completely on Valium.


Breaktaking visual scenery and first-rate FX (the entire movie was filmed in front of a blue screen) can't compensate for performances by actors who understandably seem have to have almost no love for a script that could have been written by a coma patient and a director who's far too assured that ""it'll all be fixed and filled out in editing and special effects later."" I know damned well Hayden Christensen is capable of acting. I've seen it. He seems to be channeling his role from ""Life As A House"" (no doubt that's why Lucas chose Christensen in the first place.


But the script and lack of direction seem to suck all the potential out of him. He never seems to be truly there at all.

Nor does scholar and sometimes-actress Natalie Portman. I feel kinda guilty saying this and all, but I never truly believed her as a action movie heroine in ""Episode I."" She just lacks that spunk and fire. You know, the kind that Carrie Fisher really had for almost every second she was on screen, especially when she shared scenes with Ford.


Portman simply can't do a Bidget Fonda or Pam Grier or Karen Allen. She's too sweet and vulnerable. Well, at least she seems more at home here. Although as sweet and beautiful as she is, there is no passion. Not in what she says or anything they do together.


They never seem to be in love so much as just sitting back practicing Shakesphere-style acting and mood for a theater performance.


It's nice to know good IL' Bobby Simone, yes--Jimmy Smits (Of TV's ""L.A. Law"" and NYPD Blue"" fame) is still out there and plugging away as an actor. He gets a bit in here as a Jedi Master on the council.


The only action sequences of any interest throughout take place when a Sith and Jedi masters have a powerful duel which leads to further hate and anger.


The dark side is claiming more and more Jedi by the second. 


And all this could've great for another great ""Star Wars"" classics. 


But the movie is has no life or energy. It seems almost indifferent. Like Lucas didn't have his heart (or anything else in this one).


He basically just wanted to get this one out of the way. The only thing he had in this movie is his wallet.


This whole damn movie feels like something he had to just something mandatory he had to get out of the way so he could bridge episodes I and III and continue with the rest of the series.


With the others, you know the filmmakers are giving it everything they had. Here... no one cares. Not even Lucas. 


And that's where every movie lives or dies....

"Dec 07, 2010",4,"""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Haters"". In meme context, I am a hater of the word ""haters"", but man, I've just got to say that I actually liked Hayden Christensen in this and everything else I've seen him in, yet the poor guy is out to dry simply because people are shooting him down for this film for some reason. Well, these ""Star Wars"" geeks are so obsessive, they were in a fiery frenzy when they considered to have the Anakin role go to Leonardo DiCaprio, the greatest actor on the face of the earth, so of course they were gonna throw poor Mr. Christensen under the bus, and now, everyone thinks he's bad, just because he was in this film. Come on guys, if he's just so blasted bad, then maybe you would care explain to me how in the world he got a Golden Globe nomination, which, at this point, is more credible than an Oscar nod. Well, then again, maybe I shouldn't be the one to talk about credibility, seeing as I'm about to ""explain"" why this prequel might be the best of the entire series, which isn't saying much, but man, it needs to be said, because nerd freakouts are just so much fun to watch. Well nerds, if you could, please contain yourself, because although I did genuinely like this film, it has its problems. Yes ladies and gentlmen, although this is a more realized, heavy, sweeping, violent, romantic, dark and generally more mature addition to the prequel saga, it's still for kids apparently, or at least that's what everyone keeps saying.

Even with its added depth, this film is still considered very kiddy, but really, I think this film is going the opposite route, so much so that it's stopped targeting little nerdy boys and is now reaching out to the middle-aged housewives, because this is some pretty sappy stuff. As much as I like the film, its melodrama is on a ""Lifetime"" level, and for that, we have to blame George Lucas, not just as director, but as writer. Lucas has a rock solid, if not just plain top notch taste in story concepts, but in execution, potential doesn't even make it past the scripting stages without getting rather squandered, and sure enough, Lucas' and Jonathan Hales' screenplay, while not as messy as the screenplay for ""The Phantom Menace"", is still riddled with cheesy dialogue and extreme histrionics. The cheese on paper is certainly intensified in execution, because, quite frankly, George Lucas is just not that great of a storytelling, drenching his films - even this one - in a cheesy aura, with storytelling that's often rushed, if not rather disjointed. In concept, there's a very real chance of this film being not just the best installment of the entire ""Star Wars"" series, but a straight slam-bang sci-fi epic by its own right. However, in execution, while it falls short of the ""slam-bang sci-fi epic"" part of its potential, this might very well be a step up from any preceding ""Star Wars"" installment. Sure, that's not saying much, but people, whether you like it or not, to me this film delivered more often than it slipped up, and while it's still wildly improvable, this film finally brings in some much needed depth and substance, which isn't to say that it's not as stylish as any other ""Star Wars"" film.

Sure, a deal of the visual effects are dated, but are still an improvement with less seams, as well as more life and versatility, snapping into this world organically and bringing it to life in a very dazzling fashion, especially during the action sequences, which are sweepingly well produced and staged with so much detail and intrigue that I found myself on the edge of my seat in both suspense and awe at the effective dazzle. However, as stylish as the film is, what seems to make it possibly better than any previous installment is its having more depth and substance than most any other episode, as well as its unique technique of supplementing the substance with the style, particularly the dazzling cinematography. There is a sequence in which Natalie Portman's character, Padmé Amidala, discovers Anakin, awakened by a recurring nightmare that leaves him racked with anguish and fear, gazing off into the rising sun, and that sequences, which relies so heavily on the symbolism of the sun, is so breathtakingly well lit and staged, really delivering on a moment of quiet meditation that carries the emotion of that sequence, no matter how much it is diluted by Lucas' sentimental aura. Although the film gets to be a bit too theatrical for its own good, that and many more scenes are packed with genuine depth and substance that works in very comfortable conjunction with the theatrics, from David Tattersall sweeping cinematography to John Williams' predictably fabulous score. Yeah, and if you nerds are wondering where I'm pulling all of this praise from already, just hold on to that anger until I get done complimenting the acting, because, in ""Menace"", the acting got really bad, with the mediocres being the best, but here, while the mediocres still seem to stand as the most common, there are some genuinely good performances here, from the still ever so charmingly sharp, yet more human Ewan McGregor to, well, yes, even him. Sure, Hayden Christensen isn't knocking things out like DiCaprio easily would have done if they went with him, but he still makes up for being somewhat miscast by delivering, through subtlety broken up by some pretty decent emotion, on the depth we hungered for in the portrayal of a young Anakin Skywalker as an ambitious and strong warrior, yet one tainted by inexeperience and potential corruptibility - especially after Jake Lloyd came in and messed everything up -, and watching Christensen do a fine job of unveiling the beginning of the end for this character as he unravels into darkness has to be the most compelling aspect of this film. True, the film stands to deliver more from a substance standpoint, but there is still plenty of strong depth - complimented by the performers and their admittedly razor-sharp chemistry - to bypass the predictability, and as this film drew to its hauntingly excellent conclusion, I found myself truly intrigued, wondering just what is to happen next as we draw closer to the world we've come to know.

Overall, while it's not as cheesy as its predecessor, this film is still haunted by sappy, histrionic writing and equally spotty storytelling, rendering its being disliked still rather understandable, yet what keeps it engaging to me is, of course, the dazzling technical value and sweeping action sequences, while what keeps it on a level of quality that rivals the enjoyability of any previous installment is the depth and intrigue that is carried by generally workmanlike, yet still rather respectable performances, ultimately leaving ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" to stand as both a thoroughly entertaining and rather compelling return to form for the series.

3/5 - Good"
"Dec 07, 2010",2.5,"Another sloppy prequel from George Lucas, Clones's childish love story plot combined with its at times cringe worthy dialogue, must be seen to be believed. The performances of Lee and Jackson,as well as the stunning arena battle and final saber duel, marginally improve the quality of the finished film."
"Dec 06, 2010",5,love it ..really like the forbidden romance with Padm that anakin was going on
"Dec 06, 2010",2,"Full of CGI, weird monsters and no acting. Not to mention the green nasty frog that used to be Yoda. Gah!"
"Dec 05, 2010",1,Even worse than Phantom Menace
"Dec 05, 2010",1.5,"The second episode in the Star Wars saga starts out with the bombing of senator Padme Amidala's (Natalie Portman) space shuttle and the subsequent investigation by the fully licensed Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). After a second assassination attempt - that would be right at home in a 70's Bond movie - Obi-Wan is sent out alone on a hunt for the perpetrator, leaving his hormone-tweaked student to protect Amidala.

In hiding on Amidala's home planet Naboo, Anakin has all the time in the world to hit on the reluctant senator and even breaks Jedi convention by trying to woo her with The Force. This romantic plot is an important part of Episode II and is given quite a lot of screen time, and is also one of the main reasons why it is such a bad movie. There are plenty of awkward moments; from rolling-in-the-grass-laughing cliché's to declarations of love so wooden you would need heavy doses of something narcotic to elicit any kind of emotional response from your brain. Underlining all of these scenes of completely unconvincing romance is inconsistently written characters and plain bad acting. Now, I haven't seen much of Christensen (well, ok, I have seen the absolutely horrifyingly bad Jumper, but let's do him a favour and forget it for now), perhaps he will redeem himself in future work, but Portman is hardly a bad actor. She has done some genuine good work in Leon, Garden State, Heat etc.

Looking at the rest of the cast and you see names that should instill confidence: Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee and Temuera Morrison (remember Once Were Warriors? such a good movie) among others. Not bad. But still the stiffness reigns supreme. McGregor is more of a robot than the actual robots and it feels like Jackson just doesn't want to be there at all. Here is the imaginary scenario that pops into my head over and over while I watch the movie: George Lucas hasn't so much directed this film as he have told the actors: ""please stand here, say this, do that, and I'll give you this enormous bag of cash"", scene for scene, and the actors has obliged to point.

It seems I have already started ranting, so before it goes out of hand I will just sum it up in a simple sentence.

The acting is abysmal.

The one exception to this is Ian McDiarmid who, obviously (if you have seen any of his other appearances in the series), simply is Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. It is possible that his long career in shakespearean theatre has rendered him somewhat immune to Lucas's so called direction. Christopher Lee is also fun to see, but is not given anywhere near enough time on screen to redeem anything. It is perhaps telling that the most expressive characters in the movie are robots and/or animated figures. Yoda hard to dig is not, the dynamic duo C-3PO and R2-D2 is completely ridiculous as always and I have never had such strong feelings for any character in any movie as I have for Jar-Jar Binks. That is, I have never, ever disliked a character so immensely. Thankfully he has a very limited role in this movie compared to Episode I.

However, the overarching, big picture storyline is passable I guess, with its ambiguous political drama, evil, warmongering Sith and a Jedi council caught in the middle. And while I'm desperately clawing for positive points; the visual effects are often on par, sometimes even good. At least on the technical side of things. Unfortunately the esthetics often feel a bit dry and, well, unimaginative. The environments are often plain boring. A big problem for a movie that leans so heavily on special effects. The music is good at least, John Williams powerful soundtrack has been left more or less untouched, which is a good thing. And the quality of the sound effects are impressive at least. Turn up the volume for those seismic charges.

Returning to the visual aspect, the last fifth or so of the movie which is basically an FX-injected roller coaster ride, and also the part that works best. Unfortunately it comes a bit too late as I am fed up with the whole movie at this point and mostly want it to be over. But at a 142 minutes, the end comes way too late for comfort.

Well, I surmise it is crystal clear what I think of this movie at this point. To summarize, almost every aspect of Star Wars Episode II lies on a gradient of flaws where several - most notably acting and direction - go deeply into the red. It could feel somewhat akin to home brewed charm (like Episode IV!) if it weren't so full of itself. And for the fact that adult human beings spent the equivalent of a small country's GDP on what I feel is one of the more stupid movies of the decade."
"Dec 04, 2010",0.5,"Ugh, so bad. Add in the boring factor and remove most of the good acting left."
"Dec 04, 2010",3.5,"I do so enjoy this film despite the bad press, but a few fatal flaws, such as the occasional overtly cartoonish visual effect, lack of chemistry between the two romantic leads, sometimes leaden dialogue, and a handful of segments that drag on for far too long hold it back from greatness."
"Dec 01, 2010",2,"It really just isn't very good. Hayden Christianson cannot act to save his life. The action scenes are entertaining, but the plot is weak and the movie is but a shade of the 4th and 5th."

Anakin Skywalker: ""Don't say that Master... You're the closest thing I have to a father... I love you. I don't want to cause you pain.""
Obi-Wan: ""Then why don't you listen to me?""
Anakin Skywalker: ""I try, Master.""

Palpatine: ""You don't need guidance, Anakin. In time, you will learn to trust your feelings. Then, you will be invincible. I have said it many times, you are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.""

Palpatine: ""I see you becoming the greatest of all the Jedi, Anakin. Even more powerful than Master Yoda.""

Mace Windu: ""The boy has exceptional skills.""
Obi-Wan: ""But he still has much to learn, Master. His abilities have made him... well arrogant.""

Obi-Wan: ""Anakin, may the force be with you.""
Anakin Skywalker: ""May the force be with you, Master.""

Padme Amidala: ""It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like.""
Anakin Skywalker: ""Or be with the people I love.""
Padme Amidala:"" Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.""
Anakin Skywalker: ""Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is essential to a Jedi's life. So you might say, that we are encouraged to love.""

Anakin Skywalker: ""From the moment I met you, all those years ago, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm with you again... I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you- I can't breath. I'm haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul, tormenting me... what can I do?- I will do anything you ask.""
Anakin Skywalker: ""If you are suffering as much as I am, please tell me.""
Padme Amidala: ""I can't... We can't... It's not possible.""
Anakin Skywalker: ""Anything is possible, Padme, listen to me.""
Padme Amidala: ""No you listen! We live in a real world, come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi, I'm... I'm a senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion, it will take us to a place we cannot go, regardless of the way we feel about each other.""
Anakin Skywalker: ""Then you do feel something!""
Padme Amidala: ""I will not let you give up your future for me.""
Anakin Skywalker: ""You're asking me to be rational. That is something that I know I cannot do. Believe me, I wish I could just wish away my feelings, but I can't.""
Padme Amidala: ""We live in a real world, Ani. Come back to it.""
Anakin Skywalker: ""It doesn't have to be that way. We could keep it a secret.""
Padme Amidala: ""We'd be living a lie. One we couldn't keep, even if we wanted to. I couldn't do that. Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?""

Anakin Skywalker:""I killed them, I killed them all. They're dead. Every single one of them. But not just the men, but the women, and the children too. There like animals! And I slaughtered theme like animals! I hate them!""

"Dec 01, 2010",4,"My least favorite Star Wars movie.  But, that being said...it's still a Star Wars movie."
"Nov 30, 2010",3.5,worst one. Not bad though.
"Nov 30, 2010",5,Star Wars II was a amazing movie. It helps watching the series 1-6 because then you just know the order of what happing. Attack Of The Clones was just an astonishing film and totally add to the awesome series and made it even better.
"Nov 28, 2010",2,"the acting like the first is bad, the story is confusing, but the effects were average"
"Nov 28, 2010",2.5,"No authentic emotion, no cumulative power, and no sense of physicality and danger in the action sequences."
"Nov 27, 2010",4,"Here we go, something good to the new trilogy. This is a Star Wars film you'll either love or hate, but there is one fact, it's better than Phantom Menace.

This movie takes place 10 years later after Menace, Obi-Wan Kenobi tries to uncover the mystery of the assassination attempt on PedmÃ (C), while Anakin Skywalker's mission is to protect PadmÃ (C). The story structure is way better than the last movie, switching from the noir-esque Obi-Wan story and the romantic relationship of Anakin and PadmÃ (C), with the addition of other events that fule Anakin's inner anger. A LOT of people criticise this movie's romance scenes. They're reasons might be just, but in defence I actually liked the love theme, showing a sort of forbidden love between 2 people who were raised to not focus on such human feelings. And I also get a sort of Oedipus Complex vibe hidden in the story. The two storylines come together quite well, adding more to the original 3's background, introducing Boba Fett's origins, and best of all, very little Jar Jar Binks screentime. Only a few lines, that's it, and they are bearable.

Like The Phantom Menace, this movie is clutted with CGI. And this time they even animated Yoda. But unlike Menace, there was not only purpose to the CGI, but a very creative look too. When the movie wants to be romantic, the scenery is pretty sweet. When it wants to be kick ass, it's pretty good looking. There's a chase scene in this movie that combines the look of half Fifth Element, half Blade Runner, which is pleasing to see.

Some people might not think this movie is a big improvement, but I think so. A lot of people are more or less put off by the romance scenes and the dialogue. But in all honesty it's not bad at all. This is where that character developement I've wanted from the last movie had gone too, all leading up to a tragic end. Call it lame, I think it's the best possible direction the story could go to. But this movie does indeed have redeeming qualities to the new movies."
"Nov 27, 2010",3.5,My other favorite along with The Phantom Menace.
"Nov 26, 2010",5,"I love this movie! It is one of my favorite movies of all time! I am a Star Wars freak so it is obvious that I would love the movie. This Star Wars has the biggest love story of them all. This movie is extrordinary! It almost looks real compared to other movies like this! considering how old this is, it looks real! It is a must see!"
"Nov 26, 2010",3,Just not as good as any of the Stars Movies.  Probably the most overrated of the six.  But still worth watching.
"Nov 25, 2010",4,I like some of the star wars but im sure i havent watched it all the way through
"Nov 24, 2010",2,"this movie has some great action sequences to look at and the effects are great and spectacular to see, when i was little i couldn't get enough of the last 45 minutes because its just all out war and fighting with the clones, Jedi, droids, genosians, ships, Sith, weird creatures, its freaking crazy but that's what i love about it, its intense and awesome to watch."
"Nov 23, 2010",0.5,One of the biggest mistakes since....oh I can't even compare any next to this movie...so bed
"Nov 22, 2010",3.5,Felt like an action-romance-drama. Better than episode 1.
"Nov 21, 2010",3.5,"not terrible, could use less lucas."
"Nov 20, 2010",2.5,Such a useless entry in the series
"Nov 19, 2010",3.5,"A step up from The Phantom Menance, but the whining is at times unbearable. Once again, the politics of the Universe stand out as the most intriguing aspects."
"Nov 19, 2010",2.5,"Not good by any definition of the word; Star Wars Episode Two: Attack of the Clones was an improvement over the disappointing The Phantom Menace - but certainly not by enough of a margin to lift Lucas' prequel trilogy to any level above below par. The problem here is that this film has to continue the events of the first movie (which was a spectacularly dull and convoluted mess) and move forward with the major plotline of the films; the corruption of Anakin Skywalker from noble Jedi to evil Sith lord; and Hayden Christensen manages to fail completely in portraying Anakin as anything other than a whiny, angst-ridden brat.

This is a problem, as it contradicts much of what Obi Wan Kenobi tells Luke in the original Star Wars; describing Anakin as a great pilot and a good friend. There isn't a great sense of friendship or cameraderie between Christensen's Anakin and Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan in this film. It seems that Obi Wan is, at best tolerating his moody and iritable protege. McGregor himself continues to do the Alec Guiness impression that he kept up for The Phantom Menace, and he carries that off well enough, but his performance seems a little tired. It might be the case that by this halfway point in the prequel films, his patience for delivering the cliched and hackneyed dialogue - as well as having to share the screen with invisible alien characters who got drawn in using computers during post production - is wearing somewhat thin.

The name of this film is somewhat of a misnomer. Clones are involved in the plot, but they are not the antagonists. Indeed their actual use is part of a conspiracy involving a rogue Jedi that the Jedi council send Obi Wan to investigate. This investigation doesn't really go anywhere though, as Obi Wan's investigation, and subsequent findings are pretty much ignored by the film's conclusion; which involves a battle between a seperatist robot army and republic clone army over nothing that is explained clearly in the film. Principle baddie this time is sith lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee); the motivations of whom are completely indecipherable.

This is a reccuring problem in these prequel films; there is no clear explanation of what is going on and why. For movies that are aimed at kids as much as adults (hence Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace) this is a real problem. To much extraneous, and really unrequired plotting that goes nowhere bulks out each prequel movie and really ruins pacing and is detrimental to excitement. Attack of the Clones is a better paced and more exciting film than The Phantom Menace, but still falls way short of the mark set by the older films.

Lastly, I will mention Natalie Portman and her character (senator Padme Amadala). The romance between her and Christensen's Anakin is so utterly forced and unconvincing as to be laughable. The lines that these two deliver are so trite, and their chemistry so lacking that I'm amazed that most of their scenes together were not edited out. If Geoge Lucas (who wrote the script in it's entireity lest we forget) thinks that this is what passes for two characters in love with each other then, well... he should really leave the script work to someone else (then again one could say that about pretty much all the writing in episodes one through three). I think that Portman's acting is probably worse than Christensen's, and she wasn't at all a good choice for these films.

There are some quite compelling action scenes in Attack of the Clones though, and when taken as a whole it does seem rather more considered and better structured than The Phantom Menace. What it isn't though, is a good film; the bad outweighs the good really and one gets the feeling that George Lucas - without some studio control to curb his excesses - really lacks the capacity to make a good film. He can't edit himself enough, and insists on piling on more and more computer generated imagery and unimaginative light sabre fights without ever seeming to understand that less can be more. At one point in this film, little green Jedi master Yoda fights a computer generated duel with Christopher Lee's stunt double, doing flips and sommersaults. When the audience in the cinema I was in saw this, many laughed hysterically. I'm guessing this was not the reaction Lucas was going for, and to me this proves how out of touch he really is."
"Nov 18, 2010",3,my rating exspreses itself

Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, and Ewan McGregor don't do too badly in their roles, but the dialogue's still a bit clunky and hackneyed, and Anakin...when I first read the novelization of Attack of the Clones, I liked him, but movie!Anakin's way different.

"Nov 14, 2010",3,les effets spÃ (C)ciaux sont peut-Ãªtre un peu trop mis en avant et l'alternance entre l'action intensive et les moments presque romantiques n'est pas des plus convaincantes. Certaines scÃ¨nes sont tout de mÃªme mÃ (C)morables.

"Nov 08, 2010",2.5,"Yoda: Until caught this killer is, our judgment she must respect. 

'Attack of the Clones' has the potential to be a decent film, but it is ultimately let down by the story (and acting) of Anakin and Padme, who appear dull, lifeless and two-dimensional, in an otherwise expansive world that the film creates. Their story is slow-moving and dull, and really takes away from some moments of interest, for example the development of Yoda who is highly entertaining. Overall the film feels like a filler movie for the saga, and Lucas himself started work on the third film, before this. If only he focused on that solely, and disregarded Episodes one and two. Some potential, but overall the film falls flat... almost as flat as Anakin's character."

"Nov 06, 2010",3.5,lasers n fighting n stuff = cool :)
"Nov 05, 2010",3,not as horrible as everyone says
"Nov 05, 2010",2,"Coming off as only slightly more cohesive than the first episode, ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"" (which, by the ways, is a pretty silly subtitle for the film) is still not all that good. Overall, in quality it's better than ""The Phantom Menace"" but it still suffers from many of the same flaws, just not as severely. This one is by far more fun and exciting and that says at least a little something.

Ten years have passed since the events of ""The Phantom Menace"" and Anakin (Christensen) is now apprentice to Obi-Won (McGregor). When an attempt on the life of Senator Amidala (Portman) brings the group together again, a new series of events will bring to light that an ex-Jedi named Dooku (the ever fucking awesome Christopher Lee) who is leading separatists against the Republic for which the Jedi Order works with. This leads Obi-Won in search of Amidala's assassin and leaves Anakin to guard Amidala. Entire galaxies are looking to go to war, so its up to our Jedis to put an end to it all.

Once again, the best parts of ""Attack Of The Clones"" happen to be the visuals. Lucas knows how to make this look damn epic (like always) if not somewhat cheesy at times, and the final act of the film is non-stop adrenaline bursts that borderline on feeling like a War film. This is where this film works its magic most and is the main reason to view it.

The problem with ""Attack Of The Clones"" stems once again from the general execution of the film. The pacing is much better this time around and the plot lines are at least far more entertaining with the twists and turns, but the writing is still pretty unforgiving. The dialogue is atrocious once again and the acting might just be as bad. Poor Christensen has the role of taking on Anakin Skywalker and watching him try to act with the poor dialogue and odd leaps of character arc is just painful to watch. The same goes with most of the characters and their potential movement as they attempt to overcome their own poor writing. This makes the film insanely hard to watch at times. Partner that with some completely off the wall scenes (almost anything having to do with the blooming love between Anakin and Amidala for example) that required acting and chemistry and the film crumbles right before your eyes. 

There was much more potential with this film and more often than not it fails to meet it halfway. The action is good and the visuals stunning, but once again that's what this film mostly has going for it. Other than that, its slightly better than ""Episode I"" but barely.

DARTH VADER'S BAD ASS MOMENT OF THE FILM: Anakin Skywalker finds his mother kidnapped by Sand People and then proceeds to slaughter all of them. The slaughter itself is so bad ass that they have to cut away from it to still retain the PG rating for the film. We only find out later when he tells Amidala that he slaughtered all of them. All of them. All. Of. Them. Kids too. Like animals. Then he proceeds to cry poorly on camera. That. Is. Bad. Ass.

BONUS RANT: They build this cool idea that Master Windu (Samuel L. Jackson, the man of a million poor film choices) and Jengo Fett are going to duke it out towards the end. Then he just kills him. No fight. Oops. You suck bounty hunter and because you suck, you left the audience in a stupor of unfulfilled expectations. Damn. Tsk tsk."

"Oct 19, 2010",2,"No, no and.. no. I don't like this. Even if i were tortured, i will not like this."
"Oct 19, 2010",4,Good film a successful sequel to the phantom menace good CGI use
"Oct 19, 2010",3.5,"No matter how many times I've watched this movie, I'm sorry to say that this was worse than The Phantom Menace. It moved a little to slow and only the action sequences kept me awake. Though I do love quoting the dialogue word for word in the last 30 minutes of the movie, I still say should've found a better actor than Hayden Christensen for Anakin."
"Oct 16, 2010",4,"This movie is clearly meant to Foreshadow the upcoming fall of young anakin and it is intended to set the scene for something that will ultimately separate our two young jefi knights. Anakin is portrayed well as a young man on the cusp if greatness whilst still struggling to accept the burden and reality of being a fill jedi knight. This movie i'dbis story, the story of how a young man who has accepted ideals that are alien to him, must deal with the reality of living up to them. You see that anakin trouly loves kenobi, but he is not him, not has he had bid rigid upbringing. This creates a paradox in the approach to the universe. Forget the droids, starfighters et al, this is Jedi at their most vulnerable."
"Oct 16, 2010",4.5,"Let me get the most annoying part of this movie off my chest right now.  Hayden Christensen is Not.  An.  Actor.  The only emotion he appears to show is teen angst (although, I will admit, he does THAT like a pro.)  He saps the life out of dramatic and humourous scenes alike. I feel sorry that Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman, two very talented actors, had to work with this sack of manure. 

Now, on to the more positive aspects of the film.  The story was very intriguing, with a certain mystery aspect to it.  The worlds were very detailed, although Kamino and Geonosis seemed a bit one-dimensional.  The final battle sequence was just plain cool, as was the final lightsabre fight. 

All the real actors were very talented.  Ian MacDiarmid was very convincing, and Christopher Lee was phenomenal, particularly in the temptation scene.  R2-D2 and C-3P0 provided more than their fair share of comic relief; indeed, there was a good density of humour in the film. 

During the second act, I found I was only paying attention for the Obi-Wan scenes.  The romantic subplot was WAY too forced, and was terrible, especially when juxtaposed against the far more interesting Kamino scenes. 

While this is my least favourite prequel, it is still a good movie to watch.  Just have some popcorn or something ready for when He Who Shall Not Be Mentioned tries to be romantic."
"Oct 16, 2010",0.5,"why, george?  why?  why?"
"Oct 15, 2010",2.5,"Episode Two continues the story of the origins of Darth Vader and the chronicles the beginnings of the Clone War. It's a decade or more since Anakin left home, and we get a new actor in his place as a young and inexperienced padawan. The Republic is more unstable, and things are changing for the Jedi, too. 

This movie needed a better title. The movie is constructed like a detective story for Obi-Wan and Anakin, and that almost works. It's not so much the Attack of the Clones, but the sort of ""The Clones Just Kinda Show Up"" and surprise, they're actually helpful - at first. The movie starts putting the pieces together at a very slow pace, and while its interspersed with some action sequences, it grinds along in low gear. There's several interlaced subplots, and none of them get a satisfactory treatment because there's too much ground to cover. You have to tell the political subplot as the looming threat to the peace and security of the Republic; you also have a blossoming romance; and a mystery to solve. You also get treated to some sumptuous new visuals and yet more costumes and alien races. It looks great the first time you see it on a big screen, but it's a complex mechanism that once again collapses under the weight of all that exposition and lame dialogue. 

The best performances come from Ewan Mcgregor, and Yoda finally kicks into high gear as well since he switched from puppet to CGI presentation. Once again, there are too many characters for the average somebody to keep up with or care about. Samual L Jackson is a good actor, but why do we need more Mace Windu? He doesn't do more than lead the cavalry charge at the end of the film. These dangling secondary characters ultimately hurt the flow of the film. Everybody demands screen time from Lucas' already overtaxed script. The script itself is pretty sub-par. Hayden Christiansen is just wretched as Anakin. He's not so much cocky and obnoxious as sullen and child-like obnoxious. I disliked him from the moment he opened his mouth. There was never a more unlikely and poorly handled romantic couple as Anakin/Padme. Their scenes are excruciatingly bad, and I don't believe their love for a new York second. This cuts the rug out from under the whole character of Anakin. I think if they'd played him as a Han Solo type, cocky and overconfident, but a  'sunny' individual, it would make the fall from grace much more believable. Instead, we must endure the 'rebel teen angst' problem. When I saw this film, I was well out of my teen years, and it wasn't interesting because I've seen it done better elsewhere. 

Natalie Portman finally gets into an outfit she can move in, near the end, and it helps her whole energy level. She's actually pretty cute beating up the bad guys and shooting guns, but it's too little, too late.  She can't save the horrible romance scenes. 

Christopher Lee does his Saruman-like best as Dooku, but he's not around enough to make a difference. There was an opportunity lost with that character. He truly could have been a good guy that was just as baffled as his Jedi brethren as to who was behind it. That would have been interesting. But that's not how it ends up. 

Once again...not enough robots. The team of R2D2/C3PO don't do anything much, and the levity is sadly lacking in this grim trudge through various subplots. The action sequences are long and drawn out, not sharp and short. There's no tactics, just a bunch of fights, no forethought and no one except Obi-Wan is using their heads. 

It's dull and lifeless as a film, because there's just too much to cover. As I said in my Phantom Menace review, these movies needed to be a 12-episode miniseries on HBO or similar network to cover things adequately. Then the romance could have developed naturally, and the teaming of the characters would have been created, rather than everybody splits up on their own missions. 

I love the whole Star wars universe, but again was disappointed. In short, it was all a grand and epic failure, with a big budget."
"Oct 14, 2010",2.5,"the best out of the ""first movies"" but still bad"
"Oct 14, 2010",2.5,"Some argue that the romantic subplot is extremely unconvincing. It should be noted, however, that PadmÃ©'s last relationship was at 12 (she is a lonely character). We can also extrapolate from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's modus operandi that he had all her other potential suitors relocated to the outer periphery of the galaxy."
"Oct 13, 2010",4,"Attack of the Clones has some action and not only that, there is a bit of romance and dramatic between forbidden love. So I like that, but I was also expecting more action. I also thought that Obi-Wan and the other Jedis were gonna be in it more often. It is a good Star Wars film I really liked it, but not as good as Phantom Menace in my point of view."
"Oct 12, 2010",1.5,Even worse than The Phantom Menace.
"Oct 11, 2010",2.5,"While still not reaching the height of the original trilogy, Attack of the Clones is still an improvement over The Phantom Menace."
"Oct 11, 2010",4,"Of all six films, this one is my least favourite, but that's mainly because it emphasizes on Anakin's forbidden love for Padme, and his slow but eventual decent to the Dark Side of the Force. This is perhaps the longest of the films as well, not to mention the most tiresome. There is action in it...it just takes a long time for it to show up. If there was a bit more action, I would have given it a higher score. But it's still a Star Wars movie, so I'll definetly find something to like about it. It is very interesting to see the origins of things from the original trilogy...like the death star, and the origins of Boba Fett."
"Oct 11, 2010",1.5,"The first one (minus Jar Jar) was tolerable.  But after that, the whole thing becomes too predictable.  Once the characters were introduced, you knew who was going to die and who would survive.  They'd have been better off jumping ahead and doing the last 3 parts he was originally planning to do.  It's not like any of them (except Harrison Ford) are doing much these days..."
"Oct 10, 2010",4,I think this one has the best action!
"Oct 10, 2010",3.5,"If the movie contained less hokey and cliche' dialogue, Attack of the Clones would be right up there with the Original Trilogy."
"Oct 10, 2010",4,Um pouco devagar no inicio mas mesmo assim agrada no fim!!
"Oct 09, 2010",3.5,"Marred by terrible writing during the pivotal romance scenes between Anakin and Padme. However, this episode contains much more plot development than Episode I and incredibly beautiful use of visual effects and choreography. Despite criticism, Christensen puts forth tremendous effort in portraying Anakin. That alone is worth more street cred than he gets."
"Oct 08, 2010",0.5,Just thinking about it makes me feel dirty- and not in the good way.
"Oct 08, 2010",2,"It will make you want to punch Hayden Christensen in the face. Nice special effects though, of course."
"Oct 07, 2010",2.5,"Attack of the Clones is the cheesiest and the most unbearable of all the Star Wars films, with a script that makes the experience laughably bad at times and a love story that felt forced. At least the final Geonosis battle was decent."
"Oct 07, 2010",1,Worst star wars movie ever
"Oct 06, 2010",0.5,Would rather pay to be bound and marinaded in the constant farting of a 300 pound man with severe kidney failure than have to watch this movie again.  Seriously. One. Of. The. Worst. Ever. Made. Period. Dot. No. Question. Whatsoever.
"Oct 05, 2010",3.5,"It's better than Episode I. For starters, gone are Jar Jar and poop jokes. There's a lot more action and actual moments of humor. Ewan McGregor in particular settles into his role. I actually enjoy Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin. And though Natalie Portman is less robotic this time around, she and Christensen have no chemistry. Still, it's an improvement upon the last film."
"Oct 05, 2010",1,"O god...
stinky stinky poo poo"
"Oct 05, 2010",4,"Though it lacked the action that I crave when thinking star wars, it offered insight into Anakin Skywalker's slow transformation into Darth Vader. But I honestly never would have expected Vader to have a been a whiney emo kid with daddy issues. Either way, I LOVED the duel between Yoda and dooku. it showed us WHY Yoda was considered a true Jedi Master. Not only for wisdom, but for his skill with a lightsaber."
"Oct 04, 2010",1.5,This is one of those sappy romance films.Avoid at all costs.
"Oct 03, 2010",1,i can't decide if this is better or worst than episode 2. either way it's still bad/
"Oct 02, 2010",5,"A massive planetary-war, a water drenched morld full of clones, and the negining of the end with the inner Dark Side in Anakin. Do I need to say aything more about this movie?"
"Oct 02, 2010",2,"This is the beginning of the Star Wars saga since nothing happened in part 1.  Some political bullshit happens and Obi Wan finds the army of clones.  Anakin seduces Padme by getting his Sandpeople Genocide on - women and children included - which was surprisingly more successful than buying her flowers.  I've tried telling chicks that I killed a village of sandpeople and they usually throw their drinks at me.  What the fuck is the deal?  If you have a motorcycle you are a ""bad boy"", but if you kill a whole bunch of people you should get even more pussy, because that makes you 100 times badder...

Anyways, CGI, CGI, CGI, the end."
"Sep 30, 2010",3.5,"Liked most of the movie-Yoda fighting and the Jedi stuff was pretty cool, but it does get boggled down at times with Hayden's bad acting."
"Sep 29, 2010",3.5,"I liked the fight scenes in this film. The arena fight scene, the beginning chase with Zam (the bounty hunter), The fight in the sky of obi wan vs jango, the fight on the roof with obi wan and jango and the final duel with count dooku. I liked Christopher Lee as Count Dooku the most in this film and Yoda played by frank oz. Ewen Mcgreggor is good as Obi Wan as well. I agree with alot of critics that the love story in this film is weak and so is the dialogue. But overall if you are a star wars fan then see this film."
"Sep 28, 2010",2,"Try to make up for underusing the very popular boba fett character by using Jango Fett, his father, but the movie still sucks, mainly I think because of one name: Hayden Christensen"
"Sep 28, 2010",3.5,"There seem to be many people who say that Attack of the Clones isn't the best of the prequel trilogy. In some respect, that may seem true, but in other areas, the film is good. Queen Amidala goes into hiding with Anakin Skywalker after an assassination attempt is made on her life. Obi-Wan Kenobi tries to find the assassin and uncovers the clones, which are made for the republic. McGregor and Portman do a good job at their roles, with Hayden Christensen taking over the role of Anakin Skywalker. Christensen manages to portray his character as a gloomy being, though in most respect Christensen cannot act. The lines said by both Portman and Christensen tend to be not the best, with the film relying more on action scenes and special effects. Christopher Lee delivers an outstanding performance as the film's main antagonist, with Yoda finally getting to show his true self as a computer generated warrior (which is simply amazing). The film ends with the anticipated Clone Wars beginning and Skywalker and Amidala falling in love, yet it seems in most cases this is not the best Star Wars film, though Lucas still does a good job with what he has brought onto the screen."
"Sep 27, 2010",1,should have really stopped at the chapter 6.
"Sep 27, 2010",3.5,"This film was universally criticized for its boring politics, and it's true that it is painfully slow in parts. But once you sort out all the details, it's actually a pretty interesting stuff. Plus there are some huge unintentional laughs during Padme's and Anakin's courtship on Naboo."
"Sep 25, 2010",2,ARGH!  The acting is just so bad in this one!  Ewan may be the only exception to that.  The love scenes are just beyond pathetic &amp; clumsy.  :(
"Sep 24, 2010",0.5,I would like to say that it's so bad it's good... but it's not. It's so bad it hurts.

(2002) Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones
SCIENCE- FICTION 

Special effects is the only reason to see this film since the overall movie consists of so many ""one- note performances"", drag out storyline which is an excuse to showcase it's specail effects, weapons, space ships etc.. which're superior than the older Star Wars movies starting from 1977!  I don't know how many times I used my ""fast-forward"" button on this one!

2 out of 4"
"Sep 24, 2010",4,Much better than phantom menace. War and Adventure all through the movie. Caught my eye the moment I saw it at Video Ezy.
"Sep 24, 2010",4,This is my favourite star wars in the prequel trilogy. First of all what confuses me is ep I is disgraceful and two why make a sequel but big improvement.
"Sep 22, 2010",3.5,"6.5/10

Much more action!? Less annoying characters!? Less Politics!?

Episode II is a big improvement over Ep.I and holds up alot better for the series...but alot of the dialogue is weak and The Hayden Christensen sucks! 

They made Darth Vader into a whiney little brat who seems to shows off nothing special other than good luck, and he is way less professional than every other Jedi including the little kids.

But more action! and it's fun to watch!"
"Sep 22, 2010",3,Somebody get Hayden an acting lesson. The guy sucks.
"Sep 21, 2010",0.5,should have been called attack of the clowns
"Sep 21, 2010",4,a lot less jar jar means a lot better score
"Sep 20, 2010",2.5,totally boring except for the last 20 minutes
"Sep 20, 2010",0.5,"Si la romance bancale est un art, Lucas en est le maître."
"Sep 20, 2010",3.5,"Urgle...there was hope that Episode 2 would be better than Episode 1, and it barely made it. Anakin's teenage replacement is still freakishly obnoxious, and the love scenes are boring and pointless."
"Sep 19, 2010",2.5,"Hayden Christensen majorly overacts, which is just as bad as a shitty one."
"Sep 18, 2010",3.5,"A good sequel that occurs 10 years after the events of ""The Phantom Menace""."
"Sep 18, 2010",3.5,"really enjoyed this one. 
Much like its counterpart in the original trilogy, i felt the middle prequal film was there to build on the base story from the first film and get all the pieces in place ready to the grand finale. 
though hayden christiansons anakin felt weak, i couldnt get over the cow eyes, his support by sir schristopher lee, ewan macgregor and the, once again, jaw dropping effects made this a minor inconveniance.
the effects really were wonderful, and with the introduction of genosia with no pomp and circumstance really made the star wars universe grow, as it stepped away from the planets established in the originals and the first film. 
once again, the lightsaber fights and space battles were well done, and wonderfully choreographed, but the former being still a little behind what was offered in TPM. The only real downside was yoda's combat style, which felt... wrong. it was like kermit on speed, and it didnt sit well with me at all. 
the building blocks to the love interest were a little weak, and slightly dissapointing, but the overall pace of the film and the introduction of boba fett and the clone army kind of dragged your interest away from this anyway.
a perculiar film that felt rushed in some areas, again with the love interest, and dragged out in others, um... the love interest again (does that even make sense?) but it all falls together nicely.

by the end of AOTC, i was worried, i admit. the trilogy, whilst being entertaining and mostly feeling like star wars, still didnt meet expectations, was leaning away from lore already established in novels done following the original trilogy release, and there was a lot of pressure for the third film to bring the trilogy back up to the expected standard, and to bring it in line with the original trilogys story line. despite this, i did enjoy the film, as if nothing else, it felt, at the time, infinately better than TPM."
"Sep 17, 2010",2.5,"With its brilliant action scenes put aside, AotC is just bad. It's slow and too lovey-dovey. The worst."
"Sep 14, 2010",1,"Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman must be the most uncharismatic, unromantic couple in the history of cinema and their completely unbelievable relationship destroys any credibility of the Star Wars prequels.  Seriously, what on Earth does Padme see in Anakin?  He's whiny.  He's a welp.  He's intensely stalkerish.  And when he admits to slaughtering men, women, and children all she can say is ""Anger is part of human nature.""  WTF!?!?!  As for the rest of the film...it looks to me like they spread themselves too thin with the CGI; there are boring, practically blank digital matte paintings and hordes of flat Clone soldiers zipping here and there to nowhere.  It looks cheap and that's criminal at this budget.  Honestly, people complain about Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd, but The Phantom Menace is genius next to this dreck.  VF."
"Sep 14, 2010",3.5,"In the matter of visual spectacle and visual effects, it's absolutely terrific. In the matter of acting, besides the brilliant McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Christensen was terrible and Portman wasn't very satisfying either. Though it's very entertaining."
"Sep 13, 2010",2,"Eh, I wasn't too impressed by this one."
"Sep 11, 2010",3,A bit weaker than Episode 1 but still is not that bad.
"Sep 09, 2010",3,"An OK addition, OK, not great.  

Hayden Christensen shows where whiner boy Luke got his whining ability. 

The best way to describe this film is teen-Jedi angst.  Anakin just can't get it together that he has anything to learn.  Then, add a heavy-handed dose of effects, and you've got it.  It all makes me wonder why Padme fell for him in the first place..."
"Sep 07, 2010",4.5,"When I was 10 years old I saw this film and I was entertained just by watching it. I was fascinated with the action at the end with all the Jedi. Last film we just saw 2 Jedi at work and now we see more than 200 Jedi at work. The only problem I think some people have with the film is the title. Why is this called Attack of the Clones? Because the Clone Wars has begun and this film starts a mystery as to who is behind creation of the army until we learn by Episode III. This film also reveals what the Jedi have been fearing about Anakin, Anakin and Padme` confess their love for each other and for this one I think Obi Wan is becoming more wise than we see in the originals."
"Sep 07, 2010",4,"good movie for sure, jango fett is an.....interesting substitute for boba i guess, plus anikins adulthood starts developing in this film obviously, and of course we all know that the closer he gets 2 being an adult, the closer he gets to being vader as well"
"Sep 07, 2010",1,"Probably the worst Star Wars movie. I think I've only seen this three times, and that's enough for me."
"Sep 07, 2010",4,"I own this movie and I can watch it over and over again and find something new. Okay, so the acting's not great. But who cares? It's mostly done by animated characters."
"Sep 07, 2010",1,"Now we have a sequel to the wrost film of 1999 and quess what? It BLOWS! It has the same problems as episode 1 but now we have horrible acting by Christensen and Portman. Christensen does nothing but whine and complain, and portman.....well she dosen't do anything at all. Andto add on top of that we have a horribly broken romance between the two people that can't act."
"Sep 06, 2010",2,"they ought to call it, the attack of the boring clowns..."
"Sep 05, 2010",3,"Barely an improvement over Phantom Menace.  There was a time during the movie when I growled - What the hell is going on with these terribly acted sappy scenes ?! -  If the movie ended right when they flew into the exhaust vent of the droid factory, I'd given the movie a 30 percent.  

Then the final 20 or so minutes begin and all hell breaks loose. Very entertaining to see fifty jedi running towards an army of battle droids as lasers and lightsabers are flying left and right.  

Another decent duel of lightsabers in the end with a more classical style, Count Dooku with his lightsaber.  But after he thinks he's won....Yoda walks into the fight, and surprises the hell out of everyone."
"Sep 05, 2010",3.5,I liked Episode 1 better then 2. Still a good movie though. It's star wars. Hayden did a good job as Anakin.
"Sep 03, 2010",2.5,Too much focus on Anakin (who is annoying) and Padme...yawn...still worth a look.
"Sep 02, 2010",4,"Could have made it better, definitely not one of the top three"
"Sep 02, 2010",4,"While it was a huge improvement over The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones had that old fashioned Star Wars adventure to it, but with almost everything done with CGI, and it looked amazing. The story became more clear and what follows is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, Revenge of the Sith."
"Aug 30, 2010",2,"HAI GUYZ, IT'S GEEOOORGE LOOKAASSS."
"Aug 28, 2010",2,"""Episode II"" was a childish installment for Star Wars.  The only scene in which I was interested in was the Yoda Douku duel. Very unimpressed."
"Aug 28, 2010",0.5,"The ""romance"" scenes are ever more painful to watch than the rest of this two hour toy commercial."
"Aug 28, 2010",5,I love to see the similarities between the relationship Ben and Anakin and also Ben and Luke and the this movie and the others. George Lucas did an amazingly inexplicable job on this on and I think he's just one of those guys that can't be beat
"Aug 28, 2010",3,"The most unconvincing romance-scenes in any movie, ever. It doesn't feel like they even like each other! 

Other than that; very beautiful, good gfx and sfx and a few good action-scenes."
"Aug 27, 2010",3,"Enjoyed it, despite some terrible dialogue and direction."
"Aug 26, 2010",3,My least favorite Star Wars film. Hayden Christensen is mostly to blame...
"Aug 25, 2010",3,"It feels like more of a Star Wars movie than Episode I, but come on... so many colors of light-sabers..."
"Aug 25, 2010",1,"Now we get to the stinker.  That's right, I think this is the worst of the series, worse than The Phantom Menace.  This mainly boils down to the fact that I didn't understand what this movie was about.  When it was over I couldn't even really comment on the plot because I just didn;t get it.  After multiple viewings I still don't get what's going on, so therefore I can't really explain.  Ewan Macgregor returns as Obi Wan and once again does a decent job and is starting to be molded more and more like Alec Guiness' Obi Wan.  Natalie Portman returns as Padme Amadala and is as great an actress as she is great to look at.  A lot of people would argue that she is terrible, but I think she's perfect for the part and handles the action scenes great.  Hayden Christiansen plays Anakin this time, and doesn't do very good either.  He sort of acts with that blank minded way Keanu Reeves does if you know what I mean.  The action scenes are a little more diverse, but still mostly Light Sabre oriented and overall much better than the ones in Phantom Menace.  There are more of them and have that large scale that the battles of the original films did which is nice.  The villains still are terrible in comparison to Darth Vader, but work for the movie.  Directing, Editing &amp; music are again the same, I have no need to comment further on them.  The CGI effects again look like crap, but there here to stay I suppose and do improve slightly in this film and I don't think they really could've pulled off this film any other way.  Overall the film is terrible when compared to the other films, but as a film it's not that bad and it has enough action to keep you entertained, even if it is hard to follow."
"Aug 24, 2010",3.5,"Definetly an improvement over the last star wars, but still it fails to live up to the standard set by previous star wars movies."
"Aug 23, 2010",3,"Quite frankly, this movie was just plain boring."
"Aug 23, 2010",1,Why isn't he Darth Vader yet?  boooooooooooooooooooooooooring.
"Aug 23, 2010",2.5,Vaders build up wasn't exactly the best
"Aug 22, 2010",4.5,"Okay, I love Jango. He is introduced and dies in this one. I love this one."
"Aug 21, 2010",3,"Well its better then the 1st part , but the love story is the main problem with this one ."
"Aug 21, 2010",2.5,WTF? Could've been an hour long
"Aug 19, 2010",1,"Special effects is a tool, a means of telling a story... a special effects without a story is a pretty boring thing. George Lucas once said that before the prequels in 1985. This garbage shows the new low of how terrible CGI and poor unlikable boring character development is shown by the master of destroying a great franchise. Terrible writing and ridiculous globs of special effects thrown into it. The characters are not memorable whatsoever and I sometimes think... who is this character? No one left a good impression on me not even Jango Fett!! The acting is stale and blah without any means of actually trying to be good! The story is confusing and really pointless, it really doesn't move forward with the plot only to bring in the ""storm troopers"" and turn Anakin to the dark side... oh wait... that comes out of nowhere in the third one, this is only foreshadowing... HAHAHAHHA &gt;:(.... The visuals are good in some shots but most of the time its CGI garbage splattered all over the screen with boring aliens and annoying CGI characters. Overall, its shit, its really the worst star wars film... THIS is the same guy who made the original trilogy!? O_o"
"Aug 19, 2010",3,"Wuz pretty good,But Revenge Of The Sith Wuz Way Better!!!..."
"Aug 18, 2010",4,i was confused but it was still good
"Aug 17, 2010",4,"Probably the weakest SW film, but still captivating and engaging. Plus it's immensely cool to see Yoda do his thing!"
"Aug 17, 2010",2.5,"I liked the old ones, but i hate Hayden Christensen..."
"Aug 17, 2010",3,defonitely better than its predecessor but still lacking. enjoyable still.
"Aug 16, 2010",2.5,"This is probably my least liking of the Star Wars saga. Episode II: Attack of the Clones is horribly slow, dull and even uninteresting. To see where and how Anakin Skywalker became what he soon to be was not really terribly a good way of writing. Still, there are some highlights in the movie like the first appearance of Jango Fett, Boba Fett's father. Still, the romance between Padme Amidala (played by Natalie Portman) and Anakin (played by newcomer then Hayden Christensen) was a brash and dull ill-fated romance I feel should be left out. I probably slept each scene they get together. Not the best in the saga."
"Aug 16, 2010",1,What a load of crap.
"Aug 16, 2010",5,Watching Anakin grow up is bittersweet; you love him and you hurt for him. Such an epic story...
"Aug 16, 2010",4,"In Attack Of The Clones, we see Ani and Padma meet again; at times itâs amusing and romantic. The wedding at the end is the perfect touch to the film. The film is entertaining because we switch from the two storylines, Ani looking after Padme but eventually going looking for his Mum and then Obi Wan, and Obi Wan Kenobi investigating an attempt to kill Padme, until they meet. Watching Ani say goodbye to his Mum is very sad, who had been a slave most of her life it would seem. The killing that ensued after her death was inevitable. This is where we start to see disturbing parts of Aniâs personality. The scene in the arena starting with the animals released upon Padme, Ani and Obi Wan Kenobi and ending with a battle between the clones and the Jedi is one of best parts of the film. The animals are very realistic. Seeing the Jedi alliance fighting makes me want to become a Jedi, if it were real of course. I donât remember the battle in the desert-like landscape after the Jedi leave the arena but itâs pretty awesome either way. The battle between Yoda and Count Dooku is epic; the music, Yoda using the force to take his lightsaber out of his robe, and the actual fight â the way Yoda flies around with his lightsaber, and how Yoda saves Obi Wan and Ani being squished. Great film overall."
"Aug 15, 2010",2.5,My least favourite the 3rd one was the best out of the prequels.
"Aug 15, 2010",2.5,my least favorite star wars movie
"Aug 15, 2010",4,Better than Episode I. I enjoy the drama &amp; the love story between Padme &amp; Anakin. A lot of fun to watch.
"Aug 15, 2010",2.5,"Pretty good, slightly better than the original, but lots of pointless scenes just showing off the level of cgi effects that can be done, and not much essence to the plot"
"Aug 15, 2010",3.5,"people dont like the prequels but i just watched all the star wars while ill and they are okay, now give them a break and just relax"
"Aug 13, 2010",2,"At least Jar Jar left, mostly. ... I'm sure they could've made things more painful, but honestly? When I saw this, I fell asleep."

"Aug 13, 2010",3.5,better than ep1 but cringeworthy acting and love scenes... only action and fx are good
"Aug 13, 2010",3.5,Not enough Clones!!!
"Aug 12, 2010",3.5,Good but not great follow up prequal to a franchise that changed everything.
"Aug 12, 2010",3,"An improvement comparing to The Phantom Menace, although it still lies in the shadow of the original trilogy."
"Aug 11, 2010",2.5,No esta mal solo que no queremos ver una telenovela en algo tan bueno como star wars es mi menos favorita sobre todo la actuacion de Gayden Christensen horrible...
"Aug 10, 2010",3,"A much needed improvement over The Phantom Menace. While this does not posess a exciting duel at the end like Phantom Menace did, it has way more action and shows some of the characters finally pulling out their lightsabers, like Mace Windu and Yoda. And they also show Jango Fett and a young Boba Fett. Not the best prequel but a improvement over The Phantom Menace."
"Aug 10, 2010",2.5,"whoa, padmÃ©'s a cougar!"
"Aug 10, 2010",2.5,"whoa, padmÃ (C)'s a cougar!"

"Aug 10, 2010",3.5,"see reveiw of episode one. cut, copy paste."
"Aug 10, 2010",2,"ummm, the directing style is just flat."
"Aug 09, 2010",2.5,"Although it is a vast improvement from the previous installment and offers some extremely important metanarrative, Episode II still suffers from awkwardness, joined this time by an extremely doushy main character.

- Details Breakdown -

The Good: As with Episode I, the metanarrative here is far more impressive and important than any of the characters' storylines. The plan of the Sith has finally come to light and it is a rather impressive one. It is not an easy task to turn a galactic republic into a galactic empire and this movie shows how it managed to be done as well as show the slippery slope of certain kinds of political actions. We see even more factions and galactic political struggles in this movie than in the last and it makes the universe feel more complete and the weakness of the republic more realistic. The audience is given one of the largest battles in Star Wars history and the scale alone puts things in perspective and really puts the ""wars"" in Star Wars. The beginning and end of this movie are really where it shines because during these times it focuses on the big picture, rather than on the small stories of the lead characters that nobody likes or cares about. While Obi-Wan is searching for Camino or Count Dooku is in talks with the various clans and factions making up the separatists, you can lose yourself in the bigger picture and really see how the universe in Ep. 4-6 came to being. Also, we all get to see Yoda fight like a badass for the first time ever and that scene alone is enough to make any fan happy. This movie is a major step up from Episode 1 in every way possible and it fixed the audio issues, poor editing, and Lucas finally stopped using the first take of every shot and worked his actors a little bit for better performances.

The Bad: Everything to do with Anakin and Padme bogs down the story and makes you want to bang your head into a wall. The acting is bad (although not as bad as Ep 1) and the characters are extremely unlikable. Anakin is arrogant, whiny, and super duper creepy the whole movie and you just want him to get stabbed in his creeper face. Padme is less annoying, but the fact that she somehow falls in love with a doushe when she is a super hot senator with probably loads of options across the galaxy incredibly weakens her character. Lucas' sexism comes out in this movie because even though he started with a strong female lead character, he felt the need to belittle her and just make her another damsel in distress in this movie. While characters constantly say she can take care of herself, she is in constant need of saving and it gets old real quick. The jokes and puns are more than groan worthy, they are an abomination. While Jedi die in the arena to try and save the galaxy, Lucas has C-3PO spouting off moronic lines that just make you think, ""who gives a sh*t?"". Life is not even close to precious in Lucas' world and nobody is even remotely sad when their friends die around them. Anakin starts slaughtering the Geonosians as soon as he lands on the planet and doesn't even try to talk to them. Of course they're going to execute you, you're a raving psychopath Anakin. People are gunned down in the streets like it is all fun and games and Lucas doesn't even have the JEDI, the protectors of the peace and the ones that are supposed to value life the most, stop to give a crap. Just like in Episode 1, the enemies are mostly just droids and the heroes rarely face off against their actual opponents, making the battles hollow. Although the end battle is great, having a bunch of clones against a bunch of droids is not particularly interesting since Lucas made it extremely clear that both sides are very expendable. There's no emotional connection the any of the factions or even any of the characters. Anakin is the only one that even has emotions and his emotions just turn him into a serial killer one minute and a little baby the next. No wonder the Jedi banned emotions, in the Star Wars universe emotions are a rare occurrence and when you do have them, they are wild and off the charts crazy. Although a lot of this movie is important for the bigger picture, it could have easily been combined with Episode 1 into a single movie. Cut out all of the Padme and Anakin scenes at the lake house in this movie and almost the entire battle of Naboo, and have the two of them get to know each other better on Coruscant and not in a creepy way, problem solved."
"Aug 08, 2010",3.5,"Star Wars: Episode II- Attack of the Clones is way way better than Episode I. But, like the first fil, there are several problems with this movie. The first problem is that it has two main characters. Anikan and Obi Won. More people can relate to Obi Won than Anikan. The second problem is that theres too much romance in this movie, and it goes really fast, which boring after a few minutes. I mean, really. How much can george Lucas ruin star wars? The third problem is that it gets boring at some scenes because they go slow. I like this more than the episode I but that doesn't mean that there's no problems with this film. A lot of people hate this movie. The fourth problem is that the guy who plays Anikan does a really silly, and probably bad job as him. At least Anikan wasen't a little kid in this film like episode I. I like that Jar jar Bink was not in the movie a lot because he was so annoying in the first one. No one really liked him. Anyway, that's it for this review. But, I liked the film. 3.5 out of 5."
"Aug 07, 2010",3.5,good action does not make up for bad actin but it was still a good movie
"Aug 07, 2010",3,"This could have been so much better.  The plots not great, the dialogue sucks and most of the acting is rubbish, but the action is quite good, particularly in the last half hour."
"Aug 06, 2010",2.5,"The train wreck continues! Maybe that's not completely fair. The movie was actually tolerable in the last hour. Even somewhat enjoyable. Still, carrying over from 'the Phantom Menace we were subjected to more boring characters, ridiculous dialogue, and butt-loads of unnecessary CGI."
"Aug 06, 2010",3,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is a small improvement over The Phantom Menace, but that's not saying too much.  The characters are still nowhere to be found, the special effects are still tiring, and even a cliche love story is added in.  And even worse, the terrible diolague makes a big return.

The plot goes something like this: Padme Amidalla travels to Couresant to vote in a senate meeting, but she is nearly killed by an assassin, so Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect her, and when they split up, Anakin and Padme fall in love, while Obi-Wan falls in a trap, after trap, after trap.  It all ends with the start of the fabeled clone wars, and that's the best part of the movie.

I really think that Lucas needed to do a better job with these prequels.  He had two strikes against him with these two missteps compared to the original, and he needed a base hit at least.  A mixed review from me."
"Aug 05, 2010",3,"The last three Star Wars movies will never do the first three justice, but as a fan I must view all of them. Nice to see the likes of Ewan MacGregor and Christopher Lee giving this movie some more weight to this film and in the end it was the special effects that made it watchable."
"Aug 05, 2010",2,"A much better plotline than its predecessor, too much CGI and the casting of the worst actor alive, Hayden Christensen make it unwatchable. For being called ""attack"" of clones, the clones NEVER attack, there is a lack of fighting and a script that bounces all over the place."
"Aug 05, 2010",1,Saw it once for free at work. I never need to see it again.
"Aug 05, 2010",1.5,"This was a really bad disappointment. The acting sucked, the action sucked, everything sucked. I hated it."
"Aug 05, 2010",3,"This is an improvement over Phantom Menace, but still it isn't good enough.
To start with the goods, George Lucas improved alot on the screenplay. Many of the holes has been fixed and there is more character developement. So has he with the direction, which now looks more decent. The performances have improved too, Ewan McGregor is decent now and that can be said of Samuel L. Jackson too. Christopher Lee, who plays Count Douku, was fairly good in this one. The effects are quiet good and the action still is fun.
But there are still many flaws. Well, even if the charater developement has improved, many of the other characters are still left untouched. And when some of the actors are good or decent in this movie, there are still some that are very bad. Natalie Portman is still lousy as in the first, and Hayden Christiansen was terribly miscasted. He is awful in this one, he can't portray the character, he can't carry on with him, he can't make the justice the character of Anakin Skywalker deserves. 
At the end, this one is better than the Phantom Menace but still it isn't good enough. I give this a 58%."
"Aug 05, 2010",3,Pretty much the same as The Phantom Menace.
"Aug 05, 2010",2.5,"Better than Episode I, less Jar Jar. Which is good for one whole star. Still sucks though."
"Aug 05, 2010",3.5,"Never really been a huge Star Wars fan. Lost track after a bit, and I wasn't interested in the first place, honestly."
"Aug 04, 2010",4,i liked it but it was a little of a love story
"Aug 03, 2010",2.5,predictable.  Lucas didn't bring anything special.  Just waded through storyline.
"Aug 03, 2010",4,"This is a great movie. It has a lot of action and introduces many new and interesting characters. This movie is underrated, and is one of the best Star Wars films."
"Aug 03, 2010",2.5,"A very weak film. The acting is much worse than the first film. A decent storyline, but the special effects really overwhelmed the film. Enjoyable movie, but George Lucas got a little carried away with the effects. 
Hayden Christensen is a horrible actor!"
"Aug 03, 2010",1,"Preface - In case you're for some reason considering going to see the re-releases of the atrocious Star Wars prequels in crappy post-converted 3D, I'd like to cure your selective amnesia and remind you why you hate these movies.

I really don't remember enough differences in the faults between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones to justify two separate reviews, and frankly, I don't think they deserve the extra effort. You may consider this to be a massive cop-out, and it is - but like I said, I can honestly say that neither film deserves anyone's time whatsoever.

The problem with the first film, The Phantom Menace, is that it has no protagonist, long, arduous, confusing, and boring dialogue, crappy action sequences that follow an illogical chain of plot events, and bad acting to top it all off. This isn't to say all of the actors in the film are bad, but considering the acting chops of big players like Liam Neeson and Ewan McGreggor, they can do nothing to overcome the dud of a script.

It's fine if a film elaborates for the fans on obscure details of the created universe, but this film doesn't do that. To say that it not only bores everyone to tears, but is a smack in the face to any Star Wars fan, is a severe understatement. Fictional political drama, the blatant use of iconic Star Wars symbols to lure in unsuspecting fans, an annoying child actor, and... midi-chlorians. All an absolute waste of everyone's time.

But then the sequel came, and everything changed - no wait, wait. It actually didn't change at all. All the same problems return once again. I mean, I suppose Anakin is now the protagonist, but I don't think anyone bothered to tell that to Hayden Christiansen, who plods through the story like a piece of wood that was handed a script a few minutes before shooting began.

Yes, the action is marginally improved over the previous installment, but by the time the epic battle scene rolls around in the end of the movie, the audience is so jaded by the whole thing that they will neither care why these factions are fighting, nor will they care for the high-budget special effects.

In the end, there is no humor, no one to root for, no engaging performances, no captivating story, and, coincidentally, no reason for anyone to ever see these movies.
To put it mildly, George Lucas has royally screwed the pooch (as many have said before me) with these prequel films. Without anyone to guide his CG-happy hand in the direction of good filmmaking, he has produced possibly the most disappointing prequel/sequel to the Star Wars franchise that he possible could have.

If you have any fond memories of the original series, and haven't seen these two duds, then don't. Please. These films are devoid of every characteristic that made you love Episodes IV-VI. You'll thank me when you see the horrified expressions on your friends faces when you mention Episodes I or II.

By the way, I don't think that I thought that Episode III was any good - I just didn't hate it as much as I hated these two pieces of 狗屎.

This 7-part Plinkett Review from Red Letter Media pretty much captures my view on Episode I; if you haven't seen it, it's a much better use of your time than actually watching The Phantom Menace:

[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI]

Also, for future reference, don't look to George Lucas for Star Wars excellence. Instead, refer to the creators of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (Bioware) or Genndy Tartakovsky, the creator of Clone Wars, the short-lived mini-series that aired on Cartoon Network a few years ago.

So bear all of this in mind when you're thinking of putting down another 10-15 bucks for tickets to the 3D re-releases of the original series later this year - the movies were bad then, and they're still bad now.

Be sure to leave comments - hate or love it, we want to know what you thought!

Verdict: Movie Win

"Jul 28, 2010",3,"It's very difficult to defend Attack of Clones; for a start the title itself is both poor and inaccurate which sadly is the best way to describe this film. Episode 2 is where the entire Star Wars saga goes very badly wrong. Anakin Skywalker is supposed to be the most important character of the prequels but George Lucas completely misjudges it every step of the way. From the casting all the way down the dialogue, Hayden Christensen is terrible, childish, whiny and wooden in expression. It not only makes a lot of Attack of the Clones quite embarrassing but it comes very close to completely ruining Darth Vader as a character. The special effects are an improvement but still not quite there but the musical score is once again top notch. While the love story flops, the film is saved by the other half of the story with Obi Wan and the Separatist movement, the action is decent though scattered and the final third of the film on Geonosis is when the film is at its best. Yoda vs. Dooku deservedly goes down as something of legend and most of the other cast thrive as their respective characters but Attack of the Clones is at times as poor as Star Wars can get."
"Jul 28, 2010",5,debut and demise of Jango Fett - so bittersweet

"Jul 20, 2010",3,"This was OK ""middle movie"" with little Star Wars spice."
"Jul 19, 2010",3,"While not a completely terrible movie, Attack of the Clones suffers from a stifling overcrowding of terrible one liners and blase attempts at humour in the first act to truly realise its full potential. 

Hayden Christensen does a poor job of playing Anakin. It's not outright terrible as most people say; it just constantly teeters on the edge of average.

The set pieces in the second half, such as the droid factory, are all very impressive but the viewer can't help but feel that it is trying to fill the role of 'the downbeat middle film' (which, by the way, it absolutely is not). So in my view, this is the poorest of the prequel trilogy, despite boasting some wonderful moments in the second half. The planet of Kamino remains particularly impressive."
"Jul 18, 2010",3.5,"Elan Sleazebaggano: You wanna buy some death sticks? 
Obi-Wan: [using the Jedi mind trick] You don't want to sell me death sticks. 
Elan Sleazebaggano: I don't want to sell you death sticks. 
Obi-Wan: You want to go home and rethink your life. 
Elan Sleazebaggano: I want to go home and rethink my life."
"Jul 18, 2010",3,"All in all, a far more superior film than its predecessor. Clones is far from perfect, but when it clicks, it revives the old spirit that made a generation become so obsessed with all things Star Wars in the first place."
"Jul 17, 2010",3,"It's better than the first film, but Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones isn't as depthful or mysterious as it needs to be. For something like this, George Lucas should have added more darkness. Hayden Christensen, as usual, does terrible in the role of Anakin Skywalker. Ewan McGregor shines more light on the subject than the other actors.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones begins years after Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace ends. Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is now a fully grown man, on the way to see Padme (Natalie Portman), after she receives a death threat. Alongside him, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). They are called upon to protect Padme from her deadly nemesis, whoever they are. Meanwhile, while Padme is sleeping, the same mysterious assassin attempts to kill her, as Obi-Wan and Anakin search for the murderer. When they uncover clues to who might have done such a crime, all eyes turn to ex-Jedi Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). Determined to hunt Dooku down, Anakin and Obi-Wan search for leads, leading them to a number of odd locations, before they finally confront Dooku himself.

Once more John Williams has succeeded in providing a great score. Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones's magnificent composition actually changes the tone of the movie, rather than help it, which is quite extraordinary. Rarely does a film's musical talent affect a movie in such a way. It's almost expected I might add, director George Lucas always seems to do groundbreaking things, not unintentionally, but on purpose. For example, creating such creative characters, or designing the famous-looking ships the way they are. It's a pondering thought.

Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role in the movie as Mace Windu, failing to do any real positive change to the film's flaws. Frank Oz, who plays as Yoda, however offers his usual catchy words of wisdom. Yoda has proven to be such an uplifting character that he may in fact be one of the main reasons I ended up liking this film rather than hating it. The unoriginality yet creativity behind the movie is another thing that made me reconsider. It's not exactly what shapes the film's plot, instead it's what the film has already minimized to a smaller detail. Questioning Yoda's powerful Star Wars authority, is like questioning why George Lucas bothered even making the Star Wars films at all.

I definitely recommend this movie. If you haven't seen Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, of course start with it. I mainly recommend this because it is a Star Wars film. However, it does have its moments of visual special effects (chase scene with flying cars, fight with Jango Fett) and outside material, ultimately proving it is indeed a good movie. So, whether or not you disliked Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, you should definitely pop Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones into your DVD Player and at least give it a whirl."
"Jul 17, 2010",2,Soulless and joyless. Why are these armies fighting and why are we suppose to care? The romance scenes between Anakin and Amidala are excruciatingly bad. Really good SFX tho. Eh.
"Jul 17, 2010",3,"It's the Black sheep of the Series.

Anakin is a whiny bitch in this movie all the way through. Him and Padme's relationship in similar to the relationship  I have with my toothbrush.

Also how is he not being seduced when she wears half the Cleavage exposing gear she has.

The finale is halfbaked, horrible and a mess, the fight in both the Genosian Arena and with Count Dooku are both Anti-Climactic as hell.

Final Verdict: Just passable I Guess, If i were you go watch one of those new Clone Wars T.V Episodes, Way Better."
"Jul 17, 2010",2,"Is as funny as Spider-Mans's ""Clone saga""-event."

"Jul 15, 2010",4,"A romance set against the backdrop of political unrest in the Galactic Republic, and the beginning of the Clone Wars. 

The M rating comes from a lot of elements being much darker than previous Star Wars films"
"Jul 15, 2010",2,"Slightly better than the turd called Phantom Menace because it felt momentarily like a Star Wars film. But the main problem lays in the scripting and directing, because they are pretty bad. Lucas didn't get everything out of the good cast,  because the plot is so stupid even they don't buy it. The big romance feels so forced that I didn't buy it even for a second. And how the hell should I believe that this angsty asshole of a Skywalker is going to be Darth Vader? If he would just an asshole I might believe it."
"Jul 14, 2010",2,A better sequel to an average orignal.
"Jul 13, 2010",5,"I Love this Movie Together with ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" the best part of the Series. Very good Story more adult and more darkly. Very good Acting too. I like how you can see how Ani slowly evolves to Darth Vader. The Special Effects are very brilliant and the Actionscenes are well maid. I love the Scenes at Kamino and Naboo because of the different Landscape and mood. And I love the epic final Battle of Clones + Jedi against Droids + Genosien and the Final Fight especially Yoda vs. Doku."
"Jul 13, 2010",3.5,"The demise of the Republic begins with the Attack of the Clones. Upon seeing the Clone army there is a sense of awe at the amount of troops while also realising their significance for future films.

What i found dissapointing about this film was the lack of lightsaber battles that occur. The Kenobi-Skywalker-Dooku battle was for the most part extremely weak. It improved when Anakin acquied Kenobi's saber. The battle between Yoda and Dooku was brilliant and hiarious with Yoda bouncing around with his minature lightsaber.

I dislike Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker. While i understand that Anakin needs to be depicted as arrogant and self-centered which inevitalby leads to his downfall, however i wish he didnt whine like a little girl so much.

What i loved about this film was when the Jedi revealed themselves in the Coluseum and began the massive battle. Brillantly done, visually, with the mass light show of lasers it is a credit to the visual effects department."

"Jul 09, 2010",0.5,"the action is more exciting than the last one, but it still has all of the other flaws: a poorly written plot that barely manages to make sense and come together by the last act of the movie, painfully annoying lead characters, and a love sub-story that feels so forced it baffles me that it was allowed to be shown to a wide release."
"Jul 09, 2010",4,i just love star wars
"Jul 09, 2010",2.5,"Long, drawn out and a bit pointless. I think I enjoy Phantom Menace more than this."
"Jul 08, 2010",2.5,Hayden Christensen did a terrible job.
"Jul 07, 2010",3.5,"en esseyant de créé le joint entre episode 1 et 3 lucas nous a privé du divertissement que l'ont attendait. Néenmoins on a pu voir les paysages de quelque planet et voir un peu mieux coruscant et le film a egalement amener à la série clone wars 2d qui était assé nice, bien que le film et la série clone wars 3d sucks vraiment la shit."
"Jul 07, 2010",3.5,"Better than the first, but still a disappointment. A cougar love story between the much older Padame(Portman) and teenaged Anakin(Christensen) add a strange touch of romance. You get to see some of the Dark Side that will later consume Anakin and the rest of the universe. Great fight scene towards the end with master Yoda getting involved, and the Death of Jango Fett(Morrison), in front of Boba will undoubtedly have him hating the Jedi for many years to come. All in all it was decent, but i still feel they could have done much better."
"Jul 06, 2010",3,Good battle scenes and good character development!!
"Jul 06, 2010",2.5,was no empire strikes back despite it's lofty ambitions... too much reliance on over the top cgi and not enough reliance on good script writing.
"Jul 05, 2010",3.5,"Not half bad. I do have to agree with critics that Hayden Christensen was not good in this film. Odd coming off a spectacular performance in Life as a House. Although I can imagine that any actor must find it hard to work in George Lucas's blue screen world.

Some scenes, especially in the beginning, looked super fake. I wish George would stop focusing on technology and start worrying about casting and script which made the originals great.

I thought the scenes between Jango Fett and Obi -Wan were pretty good. Also enjoyed Yoda's sword fight ;p"
"Jul 05, 2010",3.5,"I personally don't see how this can be regarded as an improvement over Phantom with the exception of visuals and action.  The foreshadowing effects take a better hold but I found the love story to be flat and other elements to not be complete.  Even some action sequences didn't seem fitting at all.  Nevertheless, it's still a good movie with great scenes setting up for some heavy events to happen later on."
"Jul 05, 2010",3,"The worst Star Wars movie ever made. It's watchable for all the elements alone, but I'm glad Lucas did a little fixing up with the last installment."
"Jul 05, 2010",3.5,yoda fights. couldn't of asked for anything better.
"Jul 05, 2010",2.5,"Oh wow, all the Star Wars prequels. Is Indy IV gonna be next?"
"Jul 05, 2010",3.5,"Well... Anyone who knows me know that I'm one of Star Wars' biggest fans, ever lol! But, honestly, this was probably my least favourite of the Epic Saga. The slightly corny acting in this one didn't impress me as much. Though it is good for special effects and for the introduction of Boba Fett and the Clone Wars, and the soon to be Stormtroopers!"
"Jul 05, 2010",3.5,"No doubt an improvement over Phantom Menace, although it still has many flaws."
"Jul 05, 2010",3.5,"This movie is one half detective movie and one half love story.  I cheered along with everyone else opening night when Yoda starts to CGI battle at the end, but now, I know this was very, very wrong."
"Jul 04, 2010",0.5,"This movie is an awful piece of filth. You see, I am a huge fan of the original trilogy. What made the originals so special? One element for instance is the fact that you have characters (real people) figthing a war and dying for what they believed against an overwhelmingly powerful evil empire. I remember as a kid and even until this day every time a revel pilot died I feel bad for the poor guy being blew away. To illustrate on this point, when in a New Hope the most senior pilot died and Luke is left alone with few other young fighters for a few moments you felt like all hope is lost and there is no way for this small band of young people to defeat this colossal empire. You feel overwhelm, you actually do feel something about the characters.  

There are no moments like this in the prequels, specially in episode 2. In this movie there is no real people at war. On the republic side you have CGI generated boring clone troopers which you don't really care about if they die or not since they are faceless and impersonal 2 dimensional characters. On the other side you have the separatist's battle droids which (to paraphrase Michio Kaku) act like retarded-lobotomized cockroaches.

On the evil side you have a guy named count Doku, the leader of the separatists. A villain played by a very good actor who unfortunately can't develop his character because nothing of what he said or do will make you discover what is his real motivation. Hence, you don't care if this guy lives or dies in this movie.
 
On the republic side you have a bunch of Jedis which you actually never met, they are just walking in the background or sharing a line here or there talking about nothing relevant about themselves, so you never ever actually care if they die or not. There is a scene when one is killed by Jango Fett, and the first time I saw this movie people actually laughed at the cinema when this Jedi was killed. 

While in the original movie you have a huge evil empire reaching every corner in the galaxy in episode 2 you have just a bunch of systems trying to leave a corrupt republic and trying to being independent. Its like the EU going to war with Iceland because they want to leave the EU. it is absurd. You now see why the prequels dont work. It is never fully explained why the Sith are helping the separatists and you are left out with the feeling that its because Palpatine is manipulating them not because they are really evil people, so actually you don't feel like they are the bad guys no matter how many times Lucas tells us this in the movie. The most ""evil"" leader of the separatist, the Viceroy, is not actually evil is more like ambitious bureaucrat who is extremely scared of the Sith. So you have the feeling the ""evil"" guys are actually victims of people pulling strings, like the Sith and few bureaucrats like the Viceroy so that destroys the whole concept of good vs. evil. 
In the original movies the empire agents with their black and gray outfits acted like the Nazis of WWII and the most memorable part is when Luke and Han attempted to rescue Leia. The officer look at the Chewaka and said: ""where are you taking this... thing"" fascism is implied in the original trilogy. By contrast in the prequels the separatist's character development dont give you any reason to hate them in fact some don't even look evil at all.    

Why the separatists want to build a planet killer? What is the purpose of such super weapon if they just want to leave the republic not to conquer it. this is a major plot hole. In episode 2 it is shown that the death star was actually designed by alien scientists in Genosis, but it is never clear if the other separatists leaders knows about this weapon or approved it, or on the contrary if they are oblivious about this, it looks like they don't know anything about it. When you hear what Viceroy said before Anakin kills him in episode 3 then the whole 3 movies morals are pointless. There is no good vs. evil, there is no real danger for the republic, no real struggle going on, just a bunch of people trying to leave an organization and few corrupted politicians and business men/women leading them. 

Bottom line: When you watch episode 2 you don't care if someone dies in this movie since all characters are 2 dimensional flat piece of cardboard and you don't give a damn for what are they fighting for since it is not clear why the separatists want to leave the republic or why they are evil for wanting to leave and what makes the Jedi the good guys for trying to stop them.

Yes, Lucas keep trying to show the separatists as nasty people but its not enough to convince the audiences."
"Jul 04, 2010",3,oh Hayden... please do us all a favor and learn how to act.
"Jul 02, 2010",3.5,Lucas`s fans will certainly attack the theatres despite the unworthyness of this sequel.
"Jul 01, 2010",3.5,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones! There's trouble in the Galactic Republic! Thousands of systems want to leave, and join the plotting Separatists. Now the republic is in need of an army, and all while this is happening, someone has attempted to assassinate Padme Amadala. And now Obi-Wan Kenobi is on a mission to track down Padme's attacker, and find out what the Separatists are up to! And meanwhile Anakin Skywalker is on a mission to...to...uuuhhh...make out with Padme I guess.
   Well, now that I got the plot out of the way, let's get on with the review! Many people see this movie as an improvement over The Phantom Menace, which it is! This movie takes place ten years later, with Anakin now being a young adult. And even though he's very whiny, he's still MUCH less annoying then in the previous installment. Jar Jar Binks (much to the joy of the fans) has a much smaller role then before. Obi-Wan Kenobi has a larger part in the plot this time around, and Padme (played by Natalie Portman) is well, what else can I say, shes hot! But my teenageness aside she's actually a pretty interesting character, who has a large role in the movie. So anyway, this is a nice entry into the Star Wars franchise, but like all of the prequel trilogy films, it does have it's share of flaws. The main thing I don't like about htis film, are the long drawn out dialog scenes, especially the ones between Anakin and Padme. EVERYONE has said it beforer, but I'll say it again, these two do NOT have good chemistry! But despite this fact, this movie still satisfies on many levels. I feel that this movie centers less around the special effects, then the last one, which is definitely a plus! Thank you for reading my review, please let me know what you think."
"Jun 30, 2010",3,I don't think that it's as good as Episode I.
"Jun 30, 2010",3,An improvement over episode 1. But still...what was Lucas thinking?!
"Jun 30, 2010",3.5,"Good improvement to the series i must admit.
I think that this sequel really improved itself on the characters, by the build up and development of them is just fantastic, really great. Also this made Star Wars fun again actually, just the epic battle sequences and fight sequences are incredible, this is the first and last time where I watched a Star Wars movie in the theater, and i had a blast, i feel this improved the story and pacing a lot better then the piece of visual garbage Phantom Menace. To tell you the truth, I haven't seen this movie in a long time, i might just check it out again. 
The only fails i have with it is probably the relationship wasn't that necessary, of course it improves the characters and progresses the story on, but it really needed editing. Also it didn't feel as climatic as Empire Strikes Back, like it needed to be more darker and actually something we can grip on to so we can see the last of this just pretty good trilogy. 
Very enjoyable watch for what i can remember, i think this is a improvement, but what do i think of the third one. 
Look Up. ^^^^^^"
"Jun 30, 2010",0.5,"See RedLetterMedia.com for an epic 90-minute review of this terrible movie.
There isn't much I can add to that masterful takedown so I'll surmise by saying that just about everything in this movie is wrong. From its lame duck script, the awful chemistry of the main characters, the over-indulgence in CGI effects and its sheer plethora of 'wtf' moments- enough to yank you right out of the story- this is by far one of the worst films ever made not just the worst of the Star Wars saga."
"Jun 30, 2010",2,A bit better than phantom menace.
"Jun 29, 2010",3.5,My least favorite Star Wars movie. Hayden Christensen played Anakin really well though.
"Jun 29, 2010",4.5,I loved it n a very nice movie to see.
"Jun 29, 2010",5,"This is one of my favorites, action packed and still loads of fun"
"Jun 29, 2010",3.5,the last 3 episodes are good but the first 3 are the best!!!
"Jun 28, 2010",1,Incompetently bridges a piece of shit to another one.
"Jun 28, 2010",2.5,It's... an average Movie.
"Jun 28, 2010",4,"Better than the first prequel, but I still was not happy that I just couldn't like skywalker, he is an annoying rotten teenager. I wanted to love him. I wanted it to be a big deal him converting to the dark side, but you could already see it in the first movie.
But taken as part of the set, I have to love it"
"Jun 27, 2010",2.5,the weakest of all star wars movies this coming from a big star wars fan but a disapointment
"Jun 26, 2010",5,The beginning of the Clone Wars.
"Jun 25, 2010",5,the star wars series never gets old!
"Jun 25, 2010",2.5,Hayden Christensen is not a good actor. I don't really like Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan. Natalie Portman does a good job. Yoda is the coolest part about this movie. Overall this movie was dull. Except Yoda. He is a badass.
"Jun 24, 2010",3.5,"This movie was pretty good, maybe slightly better than episode I. I think the romance stuff kind of kills it seeing is how Padme is probably like twice the age of Anakin. Luckily the movie is saved by awesome action scenes which shows basically a jedi army. Anyway overall it was worth seeing."
"Jun 23, 2010",4,"Way cool 21st century special effects. Not a lot of plot progress, but still a fun second Star Wars prequel."
"Jun 23, 2010",1,this movie sucks but it was better then the first prequal
"Jun 22, 2010",3.5,"This could be done better, but anyway, I like it. It's really entertaining. Afterall it's Star Wars...and it has great fight scene between Yoda and Dooku!"
"Jun 22, 2010",3,"A definite of imprioivement on the phantom menace, but the phantom menace was bad, this is alright, there are too many fight scenes in my opinion, though they are cool there is just too much of them.
The acting isnt much better, Hayden Christiensen is such a depressing actor, whenever he's on the movie just seems to slow down. Samuel L. Jackson is wasted here, he's not loud enough, Ewan Mac Gregor is good as Obi Wan, he in all fairness is the highlight of the film in my opinion
...just to many lightsabre battles...god...whats happened."
"Jun 21, 2010",3,Star Wars just isn't that good in the first three episodes.
"Jun 20, 2010",3,"The follow-up to The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones fails to live-up to its predecessor, which was bad enough. Bad acting, weak romance, and cheesy humor highlight a film where the special effects dominate everything else."
"Jun 20, 2010",3.5,"All Time Movie , This Movie Never Dies!"
"Jun 19, 2010",3.5,anakin was a lil whiney.
"Jun 19, 2010",2.5,"It seems that all Lucas cares about is how visually fascinating he can make his film, which he undeniably succeeds at. However, this is a film all about the style over the substance. The romance scenes are abysmal at best, and at the worst, an absolute atrocity to the ears and eyes, largely due to the horrible acting from Hayden Christensen."
"Jun 19, 2010",1.5,"awful movie, only slightly better than phantom menace. clone troops were kool, as was count doku &amp; jango fett. other then that it was crap."
"Jun 19, 2010",2.5,"I could never find a plot in this movie and even though there were what was meant to be ""action scenes"", to me it failed to entertain and is in my opinion the worst Star Wars film, but at least Jar Jar had a minor role"
"Jun 19, 2010",5,"Better than Empire, worse than Return, Episode 2 is still one of the High points in the Star Wars series."
"Jun 19, 2010",1,what the?  is this a video game?
"Jun 19, 2010",4.5,"Buenisima batalla de Jedis, Clones y Droides"
"Jun 18, 2010",3,"Back in 1999, most fans were disappointed by Episode I - The Phantom Menace. Three years later, we get Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones. Despite many saying that it is an improvement over The Phantom Menace, I would have to disagree. I think that is only coming from all the expectations the previous one got and it caused them to lower their expectations for this one.

Taking place ten years after The Phantom Menace, Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), now a senator representing Naboo, comes back to Coruscant to dispute over whether to create an army to repel the growing power of the Separatists. An assassination attempt was made on her life, which she narrowly escaped. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are summoned to protect her. Obi-Wan is eventually assigned to discover the identity of the assassin while Anakin guards Padme and takes her to Naboo.

After some research, Obi-Wan comes to the rainy planet of Kamino. There he finds that a Clone Army (which looks strikingly like the Stormtroopers) is being created to fight for the Republic. They were modeled after a bounty hunter named Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), the father of future bounty hunter Boba Fett. It turns out that Jango is the assassin he was looking for. He chases him to Geonosis, the base of the Separatists, which is led by former Jedi Master Count Dooku (Christopher Lee).

Meanwhile, while on Naboo, Anakin falls in love with Padme and enjoys spending time with her. But because the Jedi Code forbid a Jedi from ever marrying and any attachment, he is torn between his love and his loyalty to the Jedi. Soon after, he begins to have dreams of his mother (Pernilla August). He travels to Tatooine with Padme to save her. After his work was done, Obi-Wan sends him a message about what he had discovered, but is captured. Anakin and Padme go to Geonosis to rescue him, but soon find themselves getting involved in an event that will change the galaxy forever: The Clone Wars.

Like it predecessor, the story is uninspired. Although the title may suggest that it's about the Clones, it is really about the love story between Anakin and Padme. Because of the script and Hayden Christensen, the chemistry between them is weak. It's even questionable whether Portman had better chemistry with Jake Lloyd or Christensen. I would say that the only love stories that this is better than are those in Twilight and Pearl Harbor. The only times in which the romance is good is John Williams score (""Across the Stars""), along with the rest of his music, and the very last scene of the movie, which is devoid of any dialogue. Anakin also starts to begin his slow descent to the Dark Side, but the aftermath of it was poorly done as Christensen comes off as whiny.

However, the movie is not completely without merit. Like Episode I, this movie has good visual effects, good atmosphere, and plenty of action. The visuals effects are slightly better and although there's more visuals used in the atmosphere unlike Episode I using real-life locations, the atmosphere in Kamino and Geonosis is interesting. The movie also had a more exciting start with the speeder chase early in the film. The battle in the Geonosis arena and out in the field was also good to see. Seeing Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz, and is now in CGI) in action was fine, but it's no Qui-Gon &amp; Obi-Wan vs. Darth Maul.

On to the acting. Ewan McGregor makes a good Obi-Wan as he is becoming more like the wise old man that Alec Guinness was. Hayden Christensen is pretty weak as Anakin. Natalie Portman's performance is hindered by the script. Although Count Dooku is played by the wonderful Christopher Lee, who played Dracula from the older Dracula films and Saruman in The Lord of the Rings, his villain has nothing memorable about him unlike Darth Vader and Darth Maul. Samuel L. Jackson gets more screen time as Mace Windu, although he's not quite the tough guy he usually is. Ian McDiarmid is still good as Chancellor Palpatine. Temuera Morrison makes a very good Jango Fett, and is probably the best thing about this movie.

While still providing some thrills, it is the weakest of the saga."
"Jun 18, 2010",4.5,"A Jedi shall not know anger. Nor hatred. Nor love. These are the words of the Jedi Code that cannot be broken, and any contempt or personal attachments could lead a Jedi drawn into the dark side of the Force. Set 10 years after the Battle of Naboo back in 'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace', 'Attack Of The Clones' continues the story of Anakin's journey to the dark side while divided over his loyalties between the Jedi and the former queen Padme Amidala. Meanwhile, the Separatists under Count Dooku declared their intentions to secede from the Republic. This causes Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to approve the creation of a clone army made up entirely of copies of the bounty hunter Jango Fett. After an unsuccessful assassination attempt on the senator, Anakin was assigned to work as a bodyguard for Padme, who resists the creation of the clone army, resulting in a love attachment that is considered as forbidden by the Jedi Order.

'Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones' was directed by George Lucas and has excellent acting performances from the following cast members:
1.) Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi)
2.) Natalie Portman (Padme Amidala)
3.) Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker)
4.) Christopher Lee (Count Dooku)
5.) Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu)
6.) Kenny Baker (R2-D2)
7.) Anthony Daniels (C-3PO)
8.) Ian McDiarmid (Supreme Chancellor Palpatine)
9.) Temuera Morrison (Jango Fett)
10.) Daniel Logan (Boba Fett)
11.) Frank Oz (Yoda)
12.) Jimmy Smits (Senator Bail Organa)
13.) Silas Carson (Ki-Adi-Mundi/Nute Gunray)
14.) Ahmed Best (Jar Jar Binks)

The second episode (and fifth installment) of the 'Star Wars' saga features some of the most memorable quotes:
1.) ""Why do I get the feeling that you're going to be the death of me?"" (Obi-Wan Kenobi)
2.) ""May the force be with you."" (Obi-Wan Kenobi)
3.) ""Are you allowed to love? I thought it was forbidden for a Jedi."" (Padme Amidala)
4.) ""Someday I will be the most powerful Jedi ever!"" (Anakin Skywalker)
5.) ""I will create a grand army of the Republic to counter the increasing threat of the Separatists."" (Supreme Chancellor Palpatine)
6.) ""I have a bad feeling about this."" (Anakin Skywalker)
7.) ""Begun, the Clone War has."" (Yoda)

After watching 'Episode I - The Phantom Menace' I expected the next chapter to be as great as the last one while expecting Anakin to run into more trouble(s) that would draw him into the dark side. Upon seeing this film, I knew the action got a little bit better, but the story got a little slower according to the critics. Although I didn't agree with their negative reviews I understand them; there is a big romance subplot in the middle of it, and the best action doesn't happen until the Battle of Geonosis (including that sequence with the execution arena that made Star Wars look like Gladiator). Plus, even with Jar Jar now receiving a lesser role here he should have spoken his lines in a proper accent. Again, like Episode I, 'Attack Of The Clones' isn't necessarily perfect to the flawless level, yet it still isn't bad at all. The acting performances here are very excellent, with Hayden Christensen showing signs of rebellion against his mentor like a teenager. I still like to watch the film for great viewing entertainment to see the action, adventure, and special effects (SFX), especially when I get excited with Yoda as a Gandhi figure gone Rambo in a light saber duel with Dooku."
"Jun 17, 2010",4,Better than The Phantom Menace but the dialogue was still lacking especially in the romantic scene between Padme &amp; Anakin.
"Jun 16, 2010",2,"They literally roll in the grass, and that counts for 1 star by itself. Otherwise suck."
"Jun 16, 2010",3,"An decent film, as a huge Star Wars I liked it but, it failed to live up to any of the older films."

;)"
"Jun 14, 2010",4,Pretty good overall though some of the scenes between Anakin and Padme are just painful to watch...Hayden Christensen just makes him a whiny little bitch. But the last battle makes up for it...its awesome!
"Jun 14, 2010",4,Much more excitement than the previous installment. Things move faster and it's much more darker.
"Jun 13, 2010",3,"While slightly better than The Phantom Menace, it was not by much. The acting was somewhat better, and it felt more like Star Wars, but it was still missing the stuff that made the original three great."
"Jun 13, 2010",1.5,Worst Star Wars film...
"Jun 12, 2010",3.5,"A pretty enjoyable film, even though it has some dialogue and chemistry issues that were present in The Phantom Menace.  I enjoy the mystery aspect of the first half and Anakin's steady turn to the dark side.  At times I like it just as much as A New Hope.  Not nearly as good as Sith, Empire, or Jedi."

"Jun 10, 2010",5,Star Wars. Enough said.
"Jun 08, 2010",3.5,an improvement over the first one but still not badass enough.  The dark knight and avatar proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the market is set at pg 13 which is what all of the star wars films should have been...still with the awkward transitions and at times bad acting and less than over the top excitement that the original 3 were so famous for.

"Jun 07, 2010",3.5,"Half of this film is great, the other is so so..  I didn't care for Anakin's love interest in the first half, i think it was partially because how cheesy it seemed, and partially the fact it was Hayden Christensen which i feel didn't act well enough through out..  Also the added feelings of Anakin moving to the dark-side were well spread out i thought.. and the scene in the arena was great, especially when the fighting really broke out, was unbelievable scale.. Had some sad moments like the death of Jango Fett, and some great moments.. being the creation of Boba Fett and the appearance of Kit Fisto :)  A step up from the first episode.."
"Jun 06, 2010",4,"This particular chapter was a bit of a letdown - slightly slow and a tad uninteresting.  It doesn't feel like Star Wars until it's thrilling visual climax, which happens to make up for the rest of the boring experience."
"Jun 05, 2010",4,"The intrigue, doses of mystery, and layering of foreshadowing and growing hints of foreboding, as well as more interpersonal moments, all make this a worthwhile and subtly captivating entry in the franchise."
"Jun 05, 2010",1.5,"George Lucas' directing capabilities began to falter after his incredible classic ""Star Wars"" (now known as ""Episode IV""). The series got worse with each installment, which is such a shame, since the first was one of the all-time greatest movies ever made."

"Jun 01, 2010",4.5,Not that bad. Good special effects and acting
"May 31, 2010",2.5,"This isn't a terrible movie, but it is the weakest film of the series. This is primarily due to lousy acting from Portman and a godawful performance from Hayden Christensen. Watching Yoda flip all over the place with a lightsaber was pretty cool though."
"May 31, 2010",4,a massive improvement attack of the clones benfits from plenty of action
"May 31, 2010",3,the worst star wars movie =((
"May 31, 2010",2,"Attack of the Clones might be a competitor for worst named sequel ever, but it certainly pisses on The Phantom Menace from a considerable height. Even so, episode II, like all of the new trilogy is one to forget. Yeah, it was kinda cool to see Yoda take cocaine and go mental, but his fight with Darth Tyranus was not on a par with Darth Maul's ruck in the previous shitefest. The most interesting revelation about AotC is how it staggers around weakly, as if Lucas actually sat and watched the Phantom Menace, recognised it was shit, but couldn't tell why. Yeah, there's a bunch of Jedi fighting droids, yeah Jar-Jar Binks is hardly in it - but the character this trilogy is about, Anakin, is still dreadful. I'm a bit more loath to shred Christensen than Lloyd, since it seems like they actually wanted him to be angsty teenager. They might as well have given him a fringe and had him singing ""CRAAAWLING IN MY SKIIIN"". Considering what episodes I-III actually achieved, it's not inconceivable that Lucas thought that Vader was too popular and wanted to knock that fucker down a peg or two. Mission complete."
"May 30, 2010",2,"Maybe it's just me, but I felt like the romance got in the way of this movie being any good.  Besides the important love interest, this movie gave the feel of just being a filler flick.  Just because everyone knows there is going to be an Episode III doesn't mean it's okay to bloat the series with air."
"May 29, 2010",2.5,"Better than episode one, but still not as good as the original trilogy."
"May 29, 2010",2,"Zero romantic chemistry and a whiny twit in Anakin Skywalker make for a lousy Star Wars film. Only Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Obi-Wan, once again, saves the film. Sure, the climactic battle scene is spectacular, but with a wafer thin role of a villain played by Christopher Lee, who barely seems interested, and a somewhat convoluted stretch of logic to explain the emergence of a huge standing army (nobody seem interested in understanding how this truly came about) makes for poor drama. And, man, that whole chase scene with the female bounty hunter? It was embarrassing to watch!"
"May 28, 2010",4.5,"Regardless of many other things, the fact remains: It's Star Wars."
"May 25, 2010",3,"Un tanto mejor que The Phantom Menace, pero aun George Lucas no logra desifrar cual fue la formula que hizo que la primera trilogia fuera tan espectacular. La clave es una buena Historia."
"May 24, 2010",3,What saved this movie: Yoda w/lightsaber and the Fetts.
"May 24, 2010",3,"Many fans -- myself included -- felt the last episode lacked dramatic tension, so it's a great relief that George Lucas seems to be back on track with the latest addition to his epic franchise. Twenty-five years after the first film, the Force is still with him.

Of course, the title ""Attack of the Clones"" brings to mind a bad episode of ""Ricki Lake"" or ""Outer Limits."" Nevertheless, this one works because there's a whole lot more action, a decent love story, a plot and a subplot, and it's much easier to relate to Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker than Jake Lloyd's.

In addition, this time around the script is much better. The dialogue won't win any literary prizes, but it isn't as stilted and idiotic as in ""Episode I."" There is no doubt that the overall concept, plot points and structure come from Lucas, but you can tell he had help with the tone of the film and the dialogue. Enter co-writer Jonathan Hales, who worked with Lucas on the TV series ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.""
Quicker pace and tone

This time -- instead of suffering through a half-hour of what seems like a National Geographic special using painted matte images -- the action begins within minutes of the opening credits, setting the pace and tone for the rest of the film. Little Anakin is all grown up, still in training with Obi-Wan Kenobi, played once again by Ewan McGregor. Samuel L. Jackson is also back as Jedi Master Mace Windu, and this time he actually gets to leave the Senate chambers and kick some butt.

Natalie Portman also returns as Padme Amidala, the former queen of Naboo, now a senator. Thankfully, the job switch includes shedding her hideous Kabuki makeup and stiff costumes from ""Episode I."" This time around she looks fresh and natural -- appearing dressed by Donna Karan by way of Britney Spears.

And yes, there is a lot less Jar Jar Binks (voiced by Ahmed Best), that annoying creature with the floppy ears and warped Jamaican accent. Believe it or not, Binks is now a general and a senator. Talk about the Peter Principle at work. On the plus side, however, Yoda is mobile in a way never before possible without computer-generated imagery.

We're also back on track with the story we know and love without as much pesky exposition. There is a great deal of foreshadowing and answers to some important questions that relate to later episodes.
Setup for final chapter

With a reported budget of $120 million, this film was shot entirely with digital cameras over 60 days -- an awesome feat. Of course, many months were needed in postproduction to complete the effects.

Other than Binks, the only other jarring moments (no pun intended) are provided by McGregor. In his defense, McGregor, who is a magnificent actor, has the difficult task of trying to dovetail into someone else's performance. Other than Yoda (who is a puppet), Darth Vader (who wears a black helmet) and droids R2-D2 and C-3PO, the only character from Episodes I, II and the upcoming III who carries over into the original series is Obi-Wan, originally played by the late Alec Guinness. So McGregor is the only one who really needs to match another actor.

He's dealt with this by developing a high-class British accent, using stiff body movements and adding gray to his hair. It all comes off as if he's suddenly trying to channel Guinness, and it just doesn't work.

All in all, however, ""Star Wars: Episode II -- The Attack of the Clones"" delivers. It's dark but has wonderfully funny moments; you care about the characters; and the action and special effects are first-rate. Now, with one episode left to complete his six-part epic, Lucas' vision is taking form. You can begin to see the overall story arc for the completed franchise, and even ""Episode I"" begins to make sense -- sort of."
"May 23, 2010",3.5,star wars attack of the clones was a bit better than the phantom menace and it definately had a better story. while it still wasnt as good as the original trilogy it shined in some areas like the development of anakin towards his darker side darth vader.
"May 23, 2010",2.5,"This movie is boring as all shit! I mean what the fuck! This is so damn boring and so uninteresting I can't believe that this was really a Star Wars movie. I mean it had it's moment but they last for like a few minutes and some of the long action scenes are kind of boring. The acting is so bad. Stoic blandness comes out of each character except Obi-Wan. But still the rest of the characters are lifeless and uninteresting figures that show up and leave. Some of the dialogue is fucking dismal. My favorite awful line has to be when Anakin Fuckwalker is literally talking about why he hates sand...brilliant Mr. Lucas, thank you for showing me how much I give a flying fuck about Anakin's hate for sand. Fuck me. This is a depressing and unlikable film. It has little to no force. Sure it has moments of realization of what's to come, but for the rest it is dull uninteresting action sets and prolonged scenes of people talking in a room. This is a lazy movie that should have been thought through and it runs for so long when most of it isn't all to important. Most of the unimportant scenes revolve around Anakin and Padmae. I really hate their boring as hell love story. I get that if we see them in love together we would feel bad for the future outcomes. But for the most part I wasn't interested and cared whatsoever about their relationship and their love story. It was just something they could have shown less. Now I bitched enough, the good about this movie is that we do see a darker side to Anakin and how fragile his mind is and we can clearly see that because he is fragile he breaks into the dark side which makes sense. The death of his mother rages through his veins and slaughters everyone is a moment that shocked me and made me realize that this ain't the little fucker from the first movie he is a mentally struggling person. I liked some of the bits with Christopher Lee but honestly they weren't so riveting anyways but I liked Lee as Dooku. Ewan McGregor did a much better job and thankfully had a bigger role this time than in the last film. I liked watching Obi-Wan on the screen and accomplishing something and actually be the teacher. But for the most part the movie just suck hard dick. Not a very good movie but honestly after the last train wreck we could only hope for a better movie."
"May 23, 2010",3.5,arguably a good sequal
"May 22, 2010",1.5,I never cared for this Star Wars movie.
"May 22, 2010",3.5,"Lyle: I did not enjoy Episode I, but I did like Episode II, surprisingly. I think what makes this movie work for me is the direction by George Lucas. He really is a very decent director. He takes his time with this picture, and I liked the depth he gave to the characters of Anakin and Padme. The dialogue was bad and the acting was bad between the two of them, but he does try. And during the scene between the two of them in the meadow, it does work very well. And the battle scenes absolutely blew me away. I liked this movie just a little more than the previous one,  enough to make me pass it.

Bob: I liked this film and the first film about the same, honestly. I find it hilarious that Lucas cannot find a good actor to portray Anakin Skywalker save his life. But this is a good film, apart from his awkward scenes with Padme. And I really liked the direction he took with his story in this film. I almost felt that this was kind of a noir in places.

Lyle: A noir? Really? I think you give Lucas a little too much credit.

Bob: And I don't think you give him enough. You have to admit; that final battle was some of the most spectacular images put on film.

Bob's Rating: ****
Lyle's Rating: ***

Overall: 70%"
"May 22, 2010",1.5,"Arguably as bad as the Phantom Menace.  There still isn't a main character, the characters are still shallow and stupid and the story is full of logical errors.  At least Episode 1 didn't have a campy, Romeo&amp;Juliet type love story, how fake was that.  This proves that Lucas has officially lost all of his talent and should never be allowed on a movie set again.

PS -  Why is the guy who will turn into Darth Vader (the biggest badass ever) such a whiny bitch?"
"May 21, 2010",3,"bad script, really bad acting,some shocking cgi, lucky Portmans stomach is yummy."

"May 20, 2010",4,My least favorite of the films but still good
"May 15, 2010",2.5,Roger Ebert's right. The love is too damn clichéd and the movie is better off without JarJar. I would say the opposite of the RT consensus of this movie. You're better off watching episode I.
"May 14, 2010",3.5,The slow and incremental slide towards evil... actually a pretty good analogy for how evil people think they are somehow doing good. Reminds me of the Bush Administration.

"May 12, 2010",4.5,a keeper...I like almost all of the star wars movies
"May 12, 2010",3,Least favorite of the Star Wars Saga
"May 11, 2010",3.5,"Probably my favorite of the new Star Wars movies, but it just can't compete with the original trilogy."
"May 11, 2010",3,"Personally, this is my least favorite of the Star Wars series. The information displayed in this film IS necessary, however, the manner in which it is displayed seemed rather boring in my opinion. This entry into the saga seemed to lack much of the action present in the other films, and seemed to be much more focused on the dialogue (which isn't a bad thing). Still, there were several chunks of this movie that had me tilting my head back, which IS a bad thing. 3/5."
"May 11, 2010",2.5,"It is even more achingly obvious that the acting in these prequels is incredibly poor. A special FX spectacular with some cool settings and an interesting mystery-like plot is weighed down by a ""love affair"" between Anakin and Padme this is devoid of any real romantic chemistry between the two actors (Christensen and Portman). The ooey-gooey love dialogue exchanges are borderline excruciating and the running-through-the-hills-together scene on Naboo is cheesy. I know these prequels are about Vader's origins and his relationship with Padme is a huge part of that transformation, which is why this love tale between them should make the movies stronger, not weaker. The humor is almost non-existent here and when it is attempted it's terribly corny. 

They must've went through HELL trying to find the perfect Anakin and they finally landed on Hayden Christensen, who is far from it but they were probably running out of time. Christensen is simply not a good actor, not strong enough to carry the emotional aspects of his character. His reactions to things are simply unconvincing, to put it simply, and it's because of the actor himself, not the actual situations he finds himself in. His lines and his deliverance of those lines make Anakin just seem whiny and childish instead of subtly sinister. His acting's not bad *all* the time, but when it *is* bad, it can get pretty awful. They let an amateur take on the role of young Darth Vader, in short. 

The real saving grace of this movie is Master Yoda dropping that little cane to get busy on Count Dooku. Definitely the best scene in the entire movie and one of the most memorable moments in the prequels (next to Anakin and Obi-Wan's showdown in the final movie). And Jar Jar Binks has a very minimal role."
"May 11, 2010",4,"I found this to be somewhat of an upgrade from The Phantom Menace, but then again, I like most things Star Wars, what with their knack for emotional storytelling and visual splendor. For anyone who wants to deride me about being a delusional gandark, go ahead; but before you do, consider this: we could have gotten Battlefield Earth 2 starring the Backstreet Boys and directed by Michael Bay. And we definitely wouldn't have gotten to see Yoda defy his age, and gravity, in a lightsaber duel with Count Dooku."
"May 09, 2010",3,"Somewhat better than the childish first of the ""new trilogy"" but still should've never been made."
"May 09, 2010",2.5,The dud of Star Wars films.
"May 08, 2010",3,"George Lucas turned Darth Vader into a whinner in this trilogy...however, this is the best one out of the new trilogy."
"May 07, 2010",3,"The worst Star Wars movie I've seen. Mediocre, in my opinion."
"May 07, 2010",5,Anakin seducing Amidala was very fun to watch!
"May 06, 2010",2.5,"The last SPACE PETS movie I saw or will see. Still better than TheWorstMovieEverMade(TM), The Phantom Menace."
"May 05, 2010",1.5,"While it ups the action and effects compared to The Phantom Menace, the movie uses those same action set pieces to cover up even bigger plot holes, boring characters and possibly even worse dialogue than the first movie. Worst, the CGI effects are rapidly beginning to show their age."
"May 05, 2010",2,"Some said that this was better than Phantom Menace? Sure, it had more action than the phantom menace but this was poorly thought out. This movie was Pretty boring and i truly felt The magic of star wars was truly lost on this one. I could not tell you how bad the script was. I Felt that even though Phantom Menace had a lot of dialogue and little action, atleast i was entertained and drawn in by the dialogue of the Phantom Menace. This movie had nothing to say and nothing to keep me focused except getting to see Anakin and Padme's Love develop and a few lightsaber fights here and there.

overall, this movie just looked good and had great effects and it's saving grace was Its Lightsaber Scenes and Yoda's Fight scene. Sadly, if you weigh down everything else, this movie was just a really long movie that seemed as if it were Improvised and that the script was written on the spot. Skip this movie, it's not important and barely helps explain the Clone Wars. Sure it gave details but for how much the Clone Wars were talked about, i expected a lot more Story to it and just more overall. I felt the wait for this movie was not worth it and just a huge let down."
"May 04, 2010",2,Oh god... And i thought the first one was bad...
"May 02, 2010",2.5,"Looking at Attack of the Clones, it is great compared to The Phantom Menace, but not a good installment. Too much of the battle to make it somewhat interesting. Not awful, not good, just plain mediocre."
"May 02, 2010",2.5,"Perhaps I had not expectations after the previous movie, but I thought this installment was better - perhaps even decent. The characters were still shallow and uninteresting, but the movie connected to the original trilogy in a more providing way. I suppose it got some of our hopes up for the cinematic atrocity that was to follow..."
"May 01, 2010",5,hayden christensen is hot! he made the movie even better
"May 01, 2010",3.5,"There are certainly stretches in the patchy Attack Of The Clones when Lucas? flat-packed dialogue struggles to keep the hecklers quiet ? Anakin?s seduction of the former Queen has all the charm of a teenage lunge behind the bike-sheds and none of the feeling ? but by the time climactic ?reel six? cranks into high gear the saga?s reputation as the godfather of modern sci-fi spectacle is more or less restored. Indeed, when Yoda finally unsheathes his mini-saber and kicks Sith ass the faithful can reliably be found standing on seats hollering as if the outcome was never in doubt. But, as the little Jedi might say, in doubt it was. Where Episode V fairly zipped around the galaxy with all the breezy confidence of youth, unafraid to travel anywhere, even dark places, the second middle child of the saga is saddled with an altogether heavier burden from which it struggles to escape. Empire hits the ground running on ice planet Hoth, Clones however, has a truly cold start to contend with, aware perhaps that the movie?s most pressing task is to simply atone for the more egregious sins of Episode I. Thus, Jar Jar is quickly sidelined, the upgraded CGI Yoda gets a showcase and those damn Amidala-clones are killed off on page one. On Coruscant we also meet the grown-up ?Ani? - okay so he?s a whiny teenager but that?s still a vast improvement on the bowl-haired moppet the world was asked to root for in 1999. Also more powerful than when last we met is Ewan McGregor?s Obi-Wan, the Jedi who was simply wan in Menace is a much more forceful presence as a full-bearded Master, struggling manfully with the endless exposition and even landing the odd punchline. The middle episode that can make a virtue of its bridging role is rare indeed. And where The Empire Strikes Back dazzled with vertiginous cliffhangers, Clones is more typical of the breed, necessary but not vital. However, as we make the awkward journey through Anakin?s teenage trials a sparkling digital print ensures there is still much to marvel at, not least a little green fella who is surprisingly quick on the draw."
"Apr 30, 2010",1.5,"Way better than THE PHANTOM MENACE if you look at the action, but half the movie is pure boredom."
"Apr 29, 2010",3,Only redeeming quality: 1. the fight in the arena and 2. Yoda kicking ass.

"Apr 24, 2010",4,not the best star wars ever but a definate leap from the first one. hayden hristiansons break out role and the begining of the end
"Apr 24, 2010",3.5,"The Phantom Menace was a disappointment of colossal proportions in almost every way. It had some great effects and action sequences, but its mediocre story and overall sub-par acting brought it down. When compared with the original three movies (two of which are among the greatest films ever made), The Phantom Menace is a poor, poor follow up. The next Star Wars flick, Attack of the Clones, would slightly improve on Phantom's flaws and grow more into the Star Wars we've grown to love, although it still falls very short of the originals. 

On a visual standpoint, I think Attack of the Clones looks the best of the entire series. Coruscant's Blade Runner-esque landscape during the chase in the beginning is phenomenal. You also have the scenes of grand-scale battle on Geonosis and the marching of Clone Troopers on Kamino. All of these scenes look incredible and boast some of the greatest special effects Ive seen in recent memory. The action is also top notch. The battle in the arena with all the jedi is hugely entertaining and one of the most fun scenes to watch in all of Star Wars.

However, a lot goes bad in this film. The story is practically nonexistent. I really couldn't tell you what this was about other than the formation of a Republic army or the love story. And what a badly executed love story it is. I don't put the blame on the actors like other people do. Hayden Christensen was wonderful in Shattered Glass and we all know what Natalie Portman is capable of. No, I feel this is more due to Lucas's writing than anything. The dialog is so poor that not even Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep would be able to make it seem good. Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. also do the best with what they're given, Ewan I even feel does a great job regardless of the crappy script.

While a decidely noticeable improvement on The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones' amazing visuals are not enough to make up for its poor writing and dull story. An entertaining film, but not a great one like the originals."
"Apr 24, 2010",1,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI&amp;playnext_from=TL&amp;videos=RbiJF-Cldlg  filled with bullshitt errors and vreal incoherrent. Veak characters that sometimes don't make sense like whole scenes don't make sense. Bad Cuting!
"Apr 22, 2010",0.5,"I'd rather take a poop, wrap it in cheesecloth, and throw it at a war widow than watch this awful movie again."
"Apr 21, 2010",1,"Really, can anyone really explain the plot of this movie? So there's some group called The Seperatists - who supposedly are the big villians this time around even though we barely see them nor do they do anything to further the plot - and they're putting the Republic in a position where they're going to consider forming an army of clones. Putting aside the legion of untoppable Jedis or good, old-fashioned conscription, the clones seem to the crux of the plot here. Anyway, Padme returns wanting to stop the formation of an army to fight the army that's threatening them, but Obi-wan then finds out that there already is a bunch of clones and then the Republic suddenly know about the clones as well and somehow lay claim to the entire army and although he was strongly against a war Yoda leads the army into a war in order to save his three friends and there's this guy Count Dooku who...I have no idea. 


The glaring plot holes and idiotic jumps in logic are unfathomable. Who is this mystery Jedi who ordered that the clone army? He gets mentioned a few times, but we never see him, find out why he ordered the clones, who he was working for or what happened to him. I was waiting for it all to come to together when it's revealed that Count Dooku is really this guy or whatever, but this never plot point never gets resolved. It feels as though Lucas had the idea in his head but forgot to put it in the script. And this is just one of many blaring inconsistancies in the script. 


Whilst the plot is just as much, if not more, of a mess as in The Phantom Menace, at least the characters start to show some sembalance of personality. We have an annoying teenage kid, an annoying middle aged guy and an annoying stuck-up politician. Now that they have some character, they're on a par with robots who make stupid noises. 


Hayden Christenson puts in a truely awful performance as key role Anakin Skywalker, but I don't hold this against him. When you've got shithouse performances from Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, et al, who can only blame the director. 


The main theme of the film, and the key selling point for the film, is the forbidden romance between Skywalker and Padme. This relationship does, in fact, form the turning point for the three prequel films, being instramental in creating Darth Vader and setting up the events of the original film. But there's a problem - it's impossible to see what either of these people could possible see in each other. Every time Padme says anything, Anakin counters it by turning into a bitch-winge about himself. Padme's been working on this political action - Anakin starts bitching about his mentor and friend. Padme talks about how much she loves the view - Anakin complains about how much he likes sand. Padme talks about her passion for democracy - Anakin takes that as a cue to talk about his love of facism. 


How, in the name of all things, did she come around to wanting to secretly marry this guy by the end of the week? 


Just to finish the movie off, Lucas seems to have stuck in every 'wacky' idea that made him giggle. The viewer is bombarded with a stream of nonsense that takes them straight out of the experience. The 50's style diner filled with sassy robot waitresses and alien short-order chef, C3PO getting jumbled in with soldiers during a battle, and so forth. It's unfunny nonsense that is completely out of tone with the scenes around them. 


The action may have exciting, but the change for Jedi's from noble, wise warriors to invicible magical badasses fighting in a perfectly clean and sterile CGI environments takes any suspense, and therefore any interest, out of the equation."
"Apr 20, 2010",4.5,"Like the original trilogy, this is by far the best of the three prequels telling the story of how Darth Vader became the villian of the original trilogy."

"Apr 18, 2010",5,"For a long time star wars has captured the imagination of adults and children alike.  To compare the likes of star wars with any other story or film, just doesn't work.  It is a genre within itself, and the only reason critics don't like it, is because they can't fit it in their comfortable mould that determines how good or bad a film is.  Star wars breaks the laws and boundaries of all other films, and must be seen as one film in itself: 1 through 6.
For this reason such a film deserves nothing less than a perfect score."

"Apr 11, 2010",1.5,"There is potential here for emotion, and for an exciting mystery with a powerful conclusion. All the pieces are there... But poor directing sinks the ship. Ewan Mcgregor's is the only performance that isn't totally unwatchable. No one should be made to sit through the love story. And the visual effects and cinematography... ""Hurts our eyes, precious!!""

I love the original trilogy, so there are sections of this movie that I at least find interesting. But by itself, I can't think of anything very positive to say about it... Except that I think they did a good job on Yoda's fighting style. It didn't look totally ridiculous, which is quite an accomplishment."
"Apr 11, 2010",3,The love scenes were as stale as the toast I had this morning
"Apr 10, 2010",1.5,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones had so much potential. With the 10-year timeskip between it and the vastly disappointing The Phantom Menace, it had every chance to redeem the prequel half of the saga for the first film's mistakes, and even George Lucas seemed to realize this, as he seemed to bring new cards to the table to fix the first film's problems. He upgraded the perfectly cast but underused Ewan McGregor to leading man status as Obi-Wan Kenobi, permanently ditched Jake Lloyd, brought on Jonathan Hales to help him tighten the script, greatly decreased the role of Jar Jar Binks (though he still, regrettably, is there) and peppered the film with great amounts of fan service, from the explanation for the existence of stormtroopers to the onset of the long-speculated Clone Wars. And, despite all this, Attack of the Clones is a complete and total clusterfuck; against all odds, it is actually worse than The Phantom Menace, and in my humble opinion, is the worst movie in the entire six-part saga. Lucas' script has 3 settings that it rests on: dull, lifeless, and boring exposition scenes, awkward, forced, and boring romance scenes, and sterile, cluttered, tensionless, and boring action scenes. All that this movie does is continue to expose Lucas' limitations as a director and screenwriter, and it gets even worse this time, as he now simply films the entire movie in a computer vacuum, with two cameras in front of a green screen set. The romance between Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala is possibly the worst love story to ever grace the screen, and it is only bolstered by the horrible performances of the actors and the terrible dialogue of the script. Hayden Christensen lacks any and all charisma or likability as the young adult Anakin Skywalker, basically hitting you over the head with his destiny to become Darth Vader, and it only gets worse in the love story, where his lifeless performance clashes with Natalie Portman's second wooden outing. Samuel L. Jackson and Christopher Lee (despite a couple of mildly entertaining hammy scenes for the latter) aren't given anything to do, and neither are Ian McDiarmid, Frank Oz, Temuera Morrison, or Jimmy Smits. Daniel Logan is almost as bad as Jake Lloyd as the child Boba Fett, I can still recommend McGregor as Kenobi, as well as John Williams' score and the arena sequence near the end of the film. Other than that, it's pure tripe, shameless hokum that sullies the name of Star Wars. I didn't even like this one when I saw it in the theaters when I was 9, and when a 9-year-old doesn't like a movie with spaceships and lightsabers, be afraid. Be VERY afraid."
"Apr 09, 2010",2.5,Needed a few less effects and more story
"Apr 09, 2010",1.5,The 2 hours felt more like 4 hours.  Only see it once to know what happens in the sequal.
"Apr 09, 2010",3,"Because of Yoda at the end, this gets 3 stars."
"Apr 09, 2010",4,"The story is not be as good as the old ones but the acting is just as good, for the most part.  Some more of the back story here but a lot more action here than the previous one.  It is not as good as the originals but it is still Star Wars."
"Apr 08, 2010",0.5,"Does there even need to be an explanation? Damn, me and my strive for perfection! Now, here we go. Attack of the Clones is BAD. Itâs garbage. Everything is bigger, with more lightsaber duels, every special effect known to man throwed at the screen at once, yet it has NO tension whatsoever, and no true realism and a connection to the characters. Compare any scene in this movie to the Empire Strikes Back, and one will discover that there's no comparison. Empire Strikes Back was natural, the love between Han Solo and Princess Leia was realistic, and beautiful, and the tension was there. Attack of the Clones was a fucking cartoon.
The script is probably the worst single script ever. The dialogue is just HORRENDOUS. And what about the analogy Anakin said to Padme comparing their love to a grain of sand? I nominate that whole string of dialogue, as WORST LINE SPOKEN BY A HUMAN. EVER. Lucas has no idea what love is, and how to elevate clichÃ© 2-d love into a complex 3-d relationship. The love scenes make starving children in Africa want to bomb buildings filled with free food. And the plot sucks pretty bad (Anakin guarding Padme in some random place for the majority of the movie is not a good story. Every single scene in Star Wars/Empire Strikes Back has a plot better than this And itâs creative and original). I could forgive the billion plot holes, and the makes no sense storytelling, and the bad story to begin with if there was good dialogue and some actual substance. Overall, itâs just a failure on every level, and who could have thought that they could have topped the Phantom Menance in ruining star wars forever? My love for this movie is equal to the love âsharedâ by Anakin and Padme."
"Apr 08, 2010",0.5,Horrible move. One of the worst cinematic disasters ever to be recorded.
"Apr 08, 2010",0.5,"i think this is probably the weakest of the 2 trilogys, was a tad let down"
"Apr 06, 2010",1,i cant believe people watch this
"Apr 06, 2010",2,this movie makes me want to take a count dooku
"Apr 05, 2010",1.5,"I'd have to agree with RedLetterMedia's hilarious youtube review of this movie. In fact, I'm not sure I should've rated it as highly as I have. The acting is so terribly awful, and the lack of realism through computer graphics just makes it too cartoony, meaning I can't relate to this movie AT ALL. Best sequence is probably the part where Anakin rescues his mother."
"Apr 05, 2010",2,"Attack of the Clones is a very slight improvement on The Phantom Menace, but its still a bad movie. The pace is slow, the story is boring and full of holes, the acting is still wooden and Anakin is boring and a hugely unlikeable character. Ewan McGregor still does well the the material and Christopher Lee is awesome. The action scenes are good and the special effects are pretty good as well. But the film is still unimpressive. Oh, and the love story is one of the worst told on film."
"Apr 04, 2010",2.5,"Clones is a whiplash nightmare, going from exciting action/interesting plot development to slow romance scene in the blink of an eye. I understand that the Anakin/Padme relationship has to be explored, but they way they edited it made me sick. Anakin is a big reason I don't like this movie a lot too I think, it's not that he's ""whiny"" or whatever, he's just so stupid. I can't stand him here or in most of Revenge. Speaking of stupid, Jango Fett's death was embarrassing to watch. The only things to enjoy are a third of the action scenes, McGregor as Obi-Wan, Christopher Lee, Yoda's fight scene, and possibly Padme's altered attire at the end. Nothing to see here, move along."
"Apr 04, 2010",2,Not too impressed with this one
"Apr 04, 2010",3.5,"While having a surprising amount of cliche and at times cringe-worthy romantic dialogue, Attack of the Clones succeeds in commencing the conclusion of the saga."
"Apr 02, 2010",4,"Though the melodrama clouds most of the film's heart, the performances are powerful and as always the effects are unimaginable."
"Apr 02, 2010",1.5,"My favorite of the new trilogy. Lucas does nothing right, again. But the script is so terrible that it's actually hystarical! My love is like sand? Cracked me up."
"Apr 02, 2010",4,"nice sequel to tell the story of love
best scene: the big fight"
"Apr 02, 2010",2.5,hayden cristensen sucks...sucks...sucks...sucks...
"Apr 01, 2010",4.5,As always star wars is the greatest bunch of films ever made
"Mar 31, 2010",3,"Though Hayden Christensen is difficult to watch at times, his metamorphosis as Anakin Skywalker makes up the better portions of the film, especially his love story with Padme (Natalie Portman) who grows as an actress from start to finish. Once again, the disconnect between CGI and reality is palpable, completely ruining the authentic feel to the films. No matter how good the characters and storylines get, the CGI-heavy atmosphere of Star Wars deters the films from ever reaching a level of admiration from myself, causing me to constantly shake my head in disapproval. The epic battlefield conclusion feels too similar to that of the ending of Episode I, yet the Yoda and Count Dooku lightsaber fight compares nicely to the final lightsaber fight in Episode I."
"Mar 30, 2010",3.5,"The romance in this movie is a bit cliche, as well as some of the dialogue. But hey, this one works better than Episode I. First of all, we see more than two jedi fight (hell, yea). Basically, what I'm saying is that this one had more of what Star Wars is all about rather than what they did with I."
"Mar 30, 2010",2,"some parts are cool....but yeah George Lucas should really pick a new story, the dialogue sucks and will never compare or come close to the classic star wars"
"Mar 29, 2010",4,"A slight improvement over The Phantom Menace, most of the annoying stuff has been removed but it's hard to take Anakin seriosuly with Hayden Christensen being more wooden than the Amazon rainforest.  Still, we had the introduction of Jango Fett (although not as cool as Boba) and a nice mass lightsaber fight, although the duel wasn't very good and a lack of space battles."
"Mar 28, 2010",4,"When you watch the film, you can spot that Anakin's dark side of the Force begins to show.Getting better here, the intro of Jango Fett and the stormtroopers are cool moments and the Jedi battle on Genonsis at the end is topps.An intergalactic romance...... otherwise see my review for episode I"
"Mar 26, 2010",2.5,long and long but okish
"Mar 26, 2010",1.5,O mais fraco dos seis...
"Mar 25, 2010",4,"WAY BETTER THAN EPISODE I, that's all I can say."
"Mar 25, 2010",0.5,crap with a capital S
"Mar 25, 2010",3.5,The chemistry between Padme and Anakin is god-awful. Ewan McGregor is the only reason to watch this film.
"Mar 23, 2010",0.5,worst star wars movie still have not sat all the way through it
"Mar 23, 2010",4,"Not the best. But it still has a decent story, great visuals, and like every Star Wars movie, brought something different and unique."
"Mar 22, 2010",3.5,"Pretty good. Not near as good as the originals, but still fun."
"Mar 21, 2010",3.5,I hold a special place in my heart for star wars movies. sadly this one isn't as good. Action scenes are damn good.
"Mar 21, 2010",3,at least its not episode 1
"Mar 21, 2010",3,"my least favorite of the star wars films, but still enjoyable"
"Mar 19, 2010",3.5,A very good start to an end of a story that is star wars.
"Mar 18, 2010",2.5,"Suffered from poor editing, especially with regards to the love story."
"Mar 18, 2010",5,"underated edition in the series, epic jedi battle with beasts, this movie is great."
"Mar 18, 2010",3,Really gay name....but ok.
"Mar 18, 2010",3,"Not like the middle man movie in the old saga (Empire Strikes Back)this movie has its times where it is quite fascinating, but then it has it's times when you want to fall asleep."
"Mar 16, 2010",2.5,Not great but Yoda fighting..of yeah
"Mar 16, 2010",4,"Not the best, but a fun movie to watch."
"Mar 16, 2010",3,Hayden Christensen's bad acting is bad.
"Mar 15, 2010",2,"This is a moderate improvement over Episode I; about 80% of that is accounted for by the virtual absence of Jar Jar Binks.  There is a cool chase scene early on, a nice battle between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, and some tremendous action, to kick off the vaunted Clone Wars, at the end.  I wish the conflict itself had been more a part of the film--instead, we get yet another round of political nonsense.  (think Jimmy Smits in a Space Toga).  I liked the hints of darkness and conspiracy--I wish tremendously that the film had focused more on those and less on the Shoebox Greetings version of romance which blossoms, and blossoms, and blossoms, (until I'm ready to hurl my blue milk) between Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala.  George Lucas is right that action and special effects must serve the higher purpose of a strong story with evocative characters in order to be interesting.  And, in fact, as a Star Wars geek, I can tell you that the tale of this era in the saga's history is fascinating.  I know this because I've read the books.  You'd hardly guess the richness of the intrigue from this movie.  Who is Count Dooku?  What is the real purpose of the Clone Wars?  How are the Jedi, the Senate, the Count, and all of Sidious' minions in the Trade Federation and Techno Union being manipulated?  In Episode III all of this is breathlessly explained in the blink of an eye, but so much of the cleverness is lost because we don't see it play out.  The problem here is that Lucas seems these days to be approximating what he thinks we mere mortals need to see.  I just wonder if the guy is down-to-earth enough to make a real human drama come alive anymore."
"Mar 15, 2010",4,soy fan de star wars pero sigo siendo clasico me gustan mas las antiguas.. 4 estrellas
"Mar 13, 2010",3,"better than episode 1, but still not quite there"
"Mar 12, 2010",3,better than episode 1 still terribly worse than the classics
"Mar 11, 2010",1.5,"Well, i'm not sure of this one. Saw it because it is part of the Star Wars franchise.
I just couldn't figure out how Padme didn't age."
"Mar 09, 2010",3,Almost literally painful to watch. But Ewan McGregor with a pony tail is a bonus.
"Mar 09, 2010",3,"Ok, if George Lucas just took away all the mushy-mushy scenes, this would've got a lot better, it's still not bad though, the action is decent at least and Star Wars never fails to create a good plot."
"Mar 09, 2010",2,"Yoda fights... yeah.

Everything else... sucks."
"Mar 09, 2010",5,"oo, this is one of my favs"
"Mar 09, 2010",5,i like this movie a lot not my favourite but still a very good movie. star wars will be remembered for a long time.
"Mar 08, 2010",3,"it was an ok movie but I'm not interested in having on DVD, it was directed by George Lucas, Natalie Portman, Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGregor played good parts"
"Mar 08, 2010",3.5,none to shabby if stiff Christensen wasn't involved in any way the movie would have been a HOLE lot better
"Mar 07, 2010",0.5,"Hacia falta tener que soportar a Anakin, el futuro Darth Vader, rodando en el pasto durante 2 minutos con la reina Amidala mientras se enamoran? 
George Lucas, sos un sorete."
"Mar 07, 2010",2.5,GS did great with all the SW movies..
"Mar 06, 2010",0.5,"I keep wanting to like the Star Wars prequels so badly, and they keep on sucking so badly.  Every single time..."
"Mar 06, 2010",1.5,"I like the romance. That's what saves this movie, at least for me."
"Mar 06, 2010",4,"I call this ""Attack of the Cheese"" because I love romance, and even I thought the stuff between Anakin and Padme was too mushy. That part of the movie was like watching a 1960s romance."
"Mar 06, 2010",3,"easily the worst of the star wars movies, but not really THAT bad. as always, john williams composes an amazing score, the fights are awesome, but that still can't save the ""meh"" acting from christensen, and cheesy dialogue. 3/5"
"Mar 06, 2010",5,"Not my favorite of the films, probably the one that drags the most in my mind. It's still a great movie tho."
"Mar 05, 2010",2,I hate you George Lucas
"Mar 04, 2010",3,"When this one started off, Anakin was already a bit of a disrespectful twerp. First of all: he should have been more of a jackass than a twerp. Secondly, I would have preferred seeing him become disrespectful so I could see the beginning of the path toward the dark side.
For a while, the movie is a bit dull and the story consists largely of politics and I just lose interest and don't follow it. 
So much of the acting was very trite and corny. And now they're really overdoing C-3PO's character. He has really crappy lines and he's just annoying. I used to like him.
However, the end of the movie was pretty cool. I specifically loved the arena fight scene."
"Mar 04, 2010",2.5,"Hayden Christensen is the worst thing to happen to the series. He delivers all of his lines terribly, his Anakin is very whiny and really, really creepy towards Padme. 
I don't know why, but I had a hard time trying to figure out what the hell was going on this movie, so eventually I just gave up. 
Now, not very much happens in this movie, and I got very bored during it. 

The most redeeming quality about this movie is the last half hour, and boy, what a half hour it was."
"Mar 04, 2010",3.5,"Not as good as the originals or even episode one, but I still loved it"
"Mar 04, 2010",3,"As the special effects, and the acting by Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are well done, but it's lacking the ""emph"" of the others. Because, the others had action, breath taking acting (espicially by Harrison Ford), drama, as well as many other things. This movie turned into an almost actionless, romance. It's not terrible, but it's the worst out of the 6."
"Mar 04, 2010",2.5,Ok so I watched it to see Hayden in it but I just find it kinda boring mostly and the romance was awkward.
"Mar 04, 2010",1,*vomits* Christensen is horrible!  And Portman is so good in V for Vendetta and Garden State. Why did she suck so badly in this??
"Mar 04, 2010",3.5,"A fun if flawed film, this does take a bit to get started, and while as a whole the film isn't great, it more than adequately continues the story while providing all the glowing swords a fan-boy could want. The charge of lightsabres at the stadium is worth the price of admission alone."
"Mar 04, 2010",3.5,"Excellent!  A Great start to the anakin skywalker story, and how he starts his fall."
"Mar 04, 2010",3,remember in the first films they always talked about how anakin was such a nice guy? why is he such a moany bitch in this one.
"Mar 04, 2010",2.5,The only thing more robotic than the robots is the actors. Only plus to this movie is that Jar Jar is treated like a redheaded stepchild.
"Mar 04, 2010",1.5,"I'm a Star Wars nut, and can honestly say that this film sucked Bantha fodder.  So bad."
"Mar 04, 2010",2,Marginally better than episode 1 - but not by much.
"Mar 03, 2010",3.5,"Good film. Plenty of action and some good story building going on, especially with Anakin's darker side coming through. A bit of romance in there too."
"Mar 03, 2010",4.5,"To me considered the best in this series with a great balance of action and story. The Romeo and Juilet style romance coming of Anakin and Princess Amidala of how their love came to be to their soon tragedy. The hundreds of unique characters,species and locations are always done so well in star wars films, I think this was done best in this second film of the prequels which shows such a vast amount it makes me wonder that you could probably make hundreds of films set in this galaxy.  

Action, the best scene of all considering the action would be the fight scene with Yoda and Count Dooku, I am so sure so many people have been wanting to see what Yoda was cabable of and they have done him so well of what so many people would have imagined. The Acting is done rather well in this film, it isn't to serious, a bit of comedy, its of course not perfect but they do a good job for this fantasy galaxy. 

CGI, was a vast improvement from the first film and used very well considering its time especially for the species of monsters and droids used. Camera work was used very well in the action of this film, It was also used well in the scenes with Anakin and Amidala and was great in immersing you into its vast story.

Improvments could have been made in showing more of the Jedi council, you never know much about what they are doing and their part in the story unless you play games, read the books/comics. Overall a great film from this trilogy and a vast improvement from the first which would leave anyone looking forward to the third film"
"Mar 02, 2010",2,Yoda fights. Skip the rest.
"Mar 02, 2010",5,good movie. my favorite part was the epic jedi battle in the big colesiem
"Mar 01, 2010",3,"This has awkwardness, sexual harassment lawsuit, bad acting and star wars all in one, who could ask for more. I'm watching it now, and it seems like Padme is stuck between filing a harassment lawsuit and wanting to bone anakin. I mean really, there shouldn't be a choice, I don't think she's playing hard to get when she says ""you're making me uncomfortable"" he has the look of someone who wants to rape her or something, could be bad acting, but i don't know. 

The awkwardness in their relationship could stem from having careers that took them away from growing up, but still, creepiness abound. 

The rest of the movie is ok, Lucas I believe is trying to get to episode three, and so are the rest of you, so just put up with anakin being a douche, Obi Wan not fully having it together, and you'll make it."
"Feb 28, 2010",2,"I kept waiting for Hayden Christensen to show some kind of range, but his performance remained completely monochromatic."
"Feb 28, 2010",4,I enjoyed this film much more than Episode 1 and I'll probably watch 3 finally now.
"Feb 28, 2010",3.5,"This addition to the Starwars Saga is definitly a step in the right direction from the last one. The special effects are brilliant and the scenery is breathtaking. It also fills in more of the storyline. Samuel L. Jackson is great as a jedi, with his unique purple light saber."
"Feb 28, 2010",2.5,"Better, but not by much. I felt they were still trying to make this movie cheesy and childish but not so much compared to the first one. Horrible acting, horrible writing which makes me pretty angry. The books do justice for the story. This film however does not!"
"Feb 27, 2010",3,originals are better
"Feb 27, 2010",5,awesome! love yoda:)
"Feb 27, 2010",2.5,"If you look back at this movie today, you will notice how horrible the look of this CGI whorefest really is. Very slow build up, and that shouldnt be happening since you cannot rely on the acting  to carry you along until then. Disappointing sequel to another disappointing sequel. track record 0-2, George."
"Feb 27, 2010",2.5,"For some reason, the special effects seemed to have majorly degraded. There wasn't one thing in this movie, in terms of setting and animated characters that I believed was actually there. However, this movie more then exceeded the first episode, both in terms of acting and writing. The writing still sucked, but hey! At least the movie made some amount of sense for a change!"
"Feb 26, 2010",5,really good space flim
"Feb 26, 2010",2.5,the worst star wars movie ever made but i enjoyed it
"Feb 26, 2010",2,If only someone was there to exert some control over George
"Feb 25, 2010",1.5,The worst of the six in my opinion.
"Feb 25, 2010",3,"i wish this review system wouldn't be rounded off by tens, becuase then i could give this the slight advantage over the phantom menace. This film improves on what made the phantom menace so terrible. More jedi and laser fights? check. more impressive effects sequences? check. Jango Fett? check. Jar-Jar's death? Sadly, no. somehow a mentally defective gungan was put in the senate. but his appearance in this movie is brief. But there is one thing keeping this movie from getting an extra ten percent over its predecessor, Hayden Christiansen. He acts like a moron spewing out all of his lines in some bland monotone that sounds like it was produced from a machine. Of all the actors in the world, they had to pick a guy who has as much talent for acting as much as jar jar was a lovable character. The romance story in the movie was kind of lame, and the ending scenes are among the best in the movie. Better than the phantom menace, just not substantially"
"Feb 25, 2010",3.5,"This wasnt bad, but it was easily the weakest in the series.
The charector developement and story was alot better.
The only thing i did not like about it was the love scenes between Anakin and Padme were a little cliche."
"Feb 25, 2010",1,"Well, this film is undoubtedly better than Episode I....Anything would have to be to be honest. Having said that (and once again RedLetterMedia opened my eyes and I discovered that this film was worse than I originally thought). So, here it goes. 

Acting/Characters: Well, on the plus side, there aren't any children main characters and Jar Jar is toned down considerably. But until they remake the Phantom Menace and kill him violently the first time I we see him on screen, I can't forgive Lucas for the character's existence. And honestly, Lucas seemed to upgrade the characters a bit. Yep, each character got one new facial expression and/or emotion each: Anakin got arrogant and pissed off so he got two...lucky him, Obi-wan got irritated, and Padme got a smile. great. Good going there George. I mean, I can't say that the actors in this film are bad. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman have gone on to do some really quality stuff (can't say 100% for sure about Hayden Christensen.). But they all come across as generally emotionless and flat. I'll get to why later. Although, I will say that I highly enjoyed Christopher Lee in this film. He had the most life to him. 3/10

Plot: RedLetterMedia goes into great detail as to why this plot is just as stupid (if not in some areas more so) as the plot of Phantom Menace. He's totally right. I'll be honest, it might not be the best that I get my ideas from RLM, but I can in no way deny what he says. But, the plot is just as stupid and nonsensical as the one for #1. I don't like to do this, but I feel that he says it much better than I ever could.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfBhi6qqFLA&amp;feature=related

Sorry I deferred to someone else there. 1/10


Screenplay: Well, I shall now explain why it is not the actors fault that they suck so much in the movie. The actors could probably ad-lib better lines by themselves....drunk. But, since George has 100% control on these films and no one is gonna question the man who created pretty much the best sci-fi saga in history. I mean, Star Wars is the 2nd highest grossing film of all time. I guess that went to his head and he wrote some dumb lines to go along with his weak story to go along with his prominent special effects. It wasn't as bad as a lot of the dialogue for Episode I, but it was still stupid and a lot of it made no sense. 2/10

Likableness: Well, it was still visually pleasing like all of them, but it seemed to be too sterile and the set had no life to it. The fight scenes were good. It was like #1, visually pleasing with a few good bits here and there, but it was ultimately disappointing. 3/10

Final Score: 9/40 22% (S)


TRIVIA TIME: 1. Actors auditioning for the part of Anakin included Ryan Phillippe, Paul Walker, Colin Hanks and Jonathan Brandis. In the end Hayden Christensen got the part, primarily because he and Natalie Portman ""looked good together"". 

2. This was the first film to have an ""on-location"" film shown once a week to document the shooting process. After the success of this feature, other films adopted the same process. 

3. The librarian at the Jedi Archives (The Jedi Archives are modeled on the Trinity College library in Dublin, Ireland) says ""If an item doesn't appear in our records, it does not exist!"" This is a variation of the slogan of the Pacific Bell Yellow Pages. 

4. In the arena, Senator Amidala's gun makes the distinctive sound of a .44 Magnum, a reference to this sound accidentally being left in the sound mix when Princess Leia shoots over the chasm in the special edition of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope 

5. Just before Anakin goes to search for his mother on Tatooine, he has a conversation with Senator Amidala. The camera pans to their shadows as they talk, and Anakin's resembles that of Darth Vader. According to the DVD commentary, the Vader-like shadow that Anakin casts was not a special effect but a coincidence. 

6. The Separatist Droid army is made up of Trade Federation Battle Droids and Droidekas first seen in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace as well as the introduction of rapid-firing Super Battle Droids. The large Homing Spider Droids and the Dwarf Spider Droids belong to the Commerce Guild, while the missile-firing Hailfire Battle Droids belong to the IG Banking Clan. 

7. The character Aayla Secura, played by Amy Allen, was not created by George Lucas. Aayla Secura first appeared in the nineteenth issue of Dark Horse Comics' ""Star Wars: Republic"" series (part one of ""Star Wars: Twilight""). Lucas was so impressed with the character that he decided to have her in the film. 

8. Jar Jar Binks, standing in for Senator Amidala, puts forth the motion that gives Palpatine supreme powers. This means that Jar Jar, the most hated character in the Star Wars canon, is indirectly responsible for the fall of the Old Republic and the near-annihilation of the Jedi order. Due to much of the animosity aimed towards Jar-Jar Binks in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, the working title of Episode II was ""Jar-Jar's Big Adventure"". 

9. Most of the clone troopers wear plain white armor; some of the more senior troops' armor has added colored trim on the helmet and arms. The colors denote rank as follows: Green = sergeants, Blue = lieutenants, Red = captains, Yellow = commanders (the Jedi serve as the Clones' generals). Note that pilots also wear yellow trim, but their armor design differs from other Clones. 

10. The death-sticks that the pusher tries to sell Obi-Wan were a hallucinogenic drug. With each dose, the user's life was shortened, and the successive dosages took away larger chunks from their lifespan. With each successive dose, the desire for a harder reaction increased."
"Feb 24, 2010",1.5,Movie was okay but only slightly improves on the Phantom menace.
"Feb 24, 2010",4,I'm a Star Wars' fan... but this movie is not my favorite
"Feb 24, 2010",3.5,"Massive improvement on the 1st, and the Boba Fett scenes are epic."
"Feb 23, 2010",0.5,"Worst of the prequels.  Yes even worse than the Phantom Menace, which at least had the great lightsabber battle at the end.

This was just CGI spectacle without any substance.  The actors seemed detached, the plot was full of holes and uninteresting, the dialogue was worse than usual and delivered without any panache,  and the final battle and Yoda fight was anticlimatic.  Very disappointing."
"Feb 23, 2010",3.5,U havent seen Attack of the Clones?
"Feb 23, 2010",3.5,"Mostly for action.  The discovery of the Clone army was interesting in more than one way, also."
"Feb 23, 2010",2.5,Hated the love story aspect of it...
"Feb 23, 2010",4.5,C'mon it's Star Wars.
"Feb 21, 2010",2.5,"""Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace"" opened a whole new chapter in the Star Wars saga  introducing us to a young  9 year old Anakin Skywalker   during a time of moral conflict in the Galactic Republic. ""Star War Episode II- Attack of the Clones"" is set ten years after the events in the previous films and while it is more stunning and visually attractive than ""The Phantom Menace"". But as a continuation of the great Star Wars Saga ""The Attack of the Clones"" falls short of the glory of the franchise and film making in general.  It runs like a  bad T.V. movie something that you would see on the Sci-Fi channel, it  is hollow and bloated  it  squanders  the limitless imagination and potential it shows in favor  of being an  extravagant,  special effects action set piece.    



George Lucas'  "" Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is like I said visually spectacular and is emotional   gripping but it lacks direction and   care, it lacks the labor of love Lucas put into the original trilogy and doesn't strive to push itself. It feels like Lucas didn't care to make it to please only to make money and tell Anakin Skywalker's story, which if it had a better script, more upbeat and emotional acting and a clear sense of direction this second installment of the prequel trilogy could have lived up to it's expectations, instead it falls flat on it's face and for 2hrs. 22min it doesn't get back up. It's not a terrible movie per say but it's not a good one either it sits in between mediocre and god awful leaning more towards mediocre. ""Attacks of the Clones"" is nowhere near good but what it is a visual action spectacle that has some amazing set pieces and action but nothing.



Ewan McGregor is good  but not good enough  to help lead the charge in this film  McGregor falls flat  in every scene that he is in  ""The Phantom Menace"" he held his own very well  but here  the material, the direction and the script are not strong enough to  help him boost his performances. Instead he comes out stale, bland and emotionless but still amazingly is not an eyesore. Hayden Christensen is not an actor I would call a favorite of mine, in fact I don't really like him at all.  He's bland, emotionless, and lifeless and devoid of power in his acting he doesn't convince you at all that he is the character he embodies. In fact he does just the opposite he completely strips you of all belief that his character (Anakin Skywalker) is someone deserving of great character status.  Christensen is   incapable of drawing any feelings from the audience but   I will say this in his favor   he does try and that, in some minuscule way, is something. Natalie Portman is not good nor bad nor terrible but just plain alright in this, Portman has done better work and this film is not one of them. Portman exudes a certain charm, style and sophistication that mange to make her believable under overwhelming circumstances and even then she doesn't convince but she never lets you down and that is something I recognize and appreciate, Portman is one of the highlights of this film and also one of the heavy hitters.  The rest of the cast including Christopher Lee, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Temuera Morrison, Kenny Baker, Ian Diarmid and Samuel L. Jackson   all deliver fine supporting performances in what can easily be called the weakest if the Star Wars series.



""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is nowhere near the greatness of the first three original films or the first film in the prequel trilogy, it has it's high points but sadly there only visual and not emotional and moving the actors try there best with the material there given but they just can't seem to make it work. It lacks energy and delight it makes you feels patronized and kiddish. It can't lift itself beyond its legacy  it tries to follow and for that it sinks under the weight of one of the most powerful series ever invented (The original trilogy). ""Attack of the Clones"" is not a Sci-Fi classic or a classic of any kind it's only purpose is to serve as great rainy day entertainment when you have nothing else to do. Beyond that it's only all style and no substance."
"Feb 21, 2010",3,"Hayden Christianson's acting is atrocious, but as an overall film it's still decent. Although it's my least favorite out of all the movies in this series."
"Feb 20, 2010",3,Not the best Star Wars....
"Feb 20, 2010",5,I HAVE THIS ONE AND I WATCHED IT 15 TIMES I LUV LUKE
"Feb 19, 2010",4,a very good sequel with plenty of surprises along the way. Better than menace but it has a few flaws
"Feb 19, 2010",3.5,"Uh, u ovom nastavku se malo teze prati razvoj situacije. Saznajemo da je Republika i jedan Jedi izaslanik zatrazila klonove za eventualni rat... koji je naravno poceo. 10 godina kasnije Anakin i Padme su se zaljubili, simpaticno :) Ovdje cak Yoda sa macem lema ko blesav :))) Uh, previse toga je tu da bi se dalo opisivati. Malo mi je slabiji od prve epizode i radujem se sljedecim nastavcima."
"Feb 19, 2010",2.5,Better than the first ep...Christensen really needs to learn how to act though... I think Ewan Macgregor got splinters off him!
"Feb 19, 2010",2.5,"Lame dialog, wooden acting, and an unconvincing central love story hurt the second Star Wars prequel in a big way. While the main plot regarding the Republic is actually somewhat complex and interesting, whenever the film shifts to tell more of the blossoming romance of Anakin and Padme the horrible script and direction makes things laughable more often than believable. The special effects are hit and miss. At times they are effectively dazzling, other times as fake looking as can be. Having very few actual sets means lots of unconvincing CGI shadow effects as well as actors who clearly have no idea what is happening around them because it was all rendered into the scene after the fact. Despite all its serious flaws, there is some entertainment value to ""Attack of the Clones"". I can at least see what George Lucas was going for, the execution was simply off, and most of that comes down to the writing. This is a film that can be enjoyed on a popcorn level but falls far short of what audiences expect from the franchise. Score: 5/10"
"Feb 18, 2010",1,"The desert is rough, your skin is soft."
"Feb 18, 2010",3.5,"I loved seeing Yoda in action. That for me was one of the coolest scenes in any Star Wars movie. The Jedi battle scene was awesome as well. On the other hand, the first half of the film was tiresome. I could have done without the romantic scenes between Anakin and Padme. (First and only full viewing -3/10/2014)"
"Feb 17, 2010",2.5,Better than episode 1
"Feb 17, 2010",5,ima star wars freak!!!!!!!
"Feb 17, 2010",2.5,"Good! No Jar Jar! 

Now add a better actor, actual chemistry in that godawful romantic subplot, and better action, and you've got a Star Wars movie."
"Feb 17, 2010",3,todabia mejor que la 1
"Feb 17, 2010",2,Turn to Vader already! I'm tired of listening to you b****!
"Feb 17, 2010",2.5,"not as good as i remember it, Christopher Lee and Samuel L Jackson are good, as is Jango Fett, kinda the same as the phantom menace, good for the last half hour"
"Feb 17, 2010",0.5,can i give less then half a star
"Feb 16, 2010",2.5,not even close to the originals
"Feb 16, 2010",2,"Pretty boring. I think the introduction of Hayden Christensen as Anakin is a new low-point, even after we had Jar-Jar Binks in the first film. Really disappointing how lame a lot of the action set-pieces are, some very uninspired stuff. Last of the ""rubbish ones"" tomorrow hopefully."
"Feb 15, 2010",4,better then episode 1 lol
"Feb 15, 2010",3,"7-word review:

First rate action; okay plot, love story.

""Begun, the Clone Wars has."""
"Feb 14, 2010",4.5,"Love it...  the introduction of the Clone Troopers happens in this film, and is truly epic.  Ewan McGreggor is incredible as Obi-Wan, and the film lays the foundation for all of the greatness to follow."
"Feb 14, 2010",3,"This movie could be better, but it does still delivers. 

SPOILER!!!

Anakin turn into Darth Vader at the end of movie 3"
"Feb 14, 2010",2.5,"it's ok, but not up to the standard of the original 3 that came out."
"Feb 14, 2010",2.5,Better than the first and I really enjoyed the Jedi Battle scene!!
"Feb 14, 2010",2,"I would probably have an easier job believing the love story were it not for the fact that Christensen looks like he's twelve, going on eleven, and acting like it too. To be fair, he can't be blamed for the corny script though."
"Feb 14, 2010",0.5,"TrÃ¨s mauvais. Contrairement au premier, personne pour sauver ce film..."
"Feb 13, 2010",3.5,"no es la mejor de star wars, pero es star wars xD"
"Feb 13, 2010",4,"Pretty much the worst of all six of them, but still pretty good.  Damn you Hayden Christensen for ruining the classics!!"
"Feb 12, 2010",3.5,"I loved the idea of having a mystery movie feel.  The only problem was it drifted away from that and gave us a really dumb love story.  I loved Anakin's start toward the dark side, the fighting, the mystery, but why was the love story so stupid?  I didn't mind the love triangle in the original Star Wars, but this for some reason just seemed silly to me.  Still a good movie, but why?"
"Feb 11, 2010",2,Hayden Christensen = EPIC SITH FAIL......................
"Feb 10, 2010",3,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is a significant step in the right direction from ""The Phantom Menace.""  Ewan McGregor, as expected, did a decentjob (despite some spots of terribly written dialog). Natalie Portman's acting ability shined through just a little bit more then it did it the first installment of the series but was dragged down by Hayden Christensen's stiff and emotionless performance.  Visually this movie was beautiful minus one or two poorly rendered computer animations. All and all this movie was actually worth a watch or two.

I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in the Star Wars universe and wants to catch a decent installment of the story."
"Feb 09, 2010",1,One of the worst films ever! Maybe its personal
"Feb 08, 2010",4.5,"Though George Lucas can't for the life of him write or direct a love scene, he makes up for it with an excellent buildup towards the inevitable events we know will happen in the next installment.  Though the dialogue is horrendous, Attack of the Clones features excellent action and special effects, and a phenomenal score from John Williams."
"Feb 07, 2010",4,"Better acting, action is still good, but the movie drags worse than Jabba the Hut."
"Feb 07, 2010",3.5,"I'm gonna say it. I LOVE this film, ever since I first saw it I have prefered it to the Phantom Menace and once it came out, Revenge of the Sith. Thank god though, that Jar Jar is only in this one for about two minutes."
"Feb 07, 2010",3,What would we do without Yoda?
"Feb 06, 2010",3,"The CGI improved a lot from the 77 till now (02) but looking back: the fights, the stormtroopers they were much better than what happened in the finale battle :/ 
They must have sensed that they are being played :/ and all that talk about the force :/ 
Regarding Anakin we just saw him killing a whole village :) he is on his path to the dark-side 3:)
The first one was slightly better - it wasn't that great neither...
I''ll give it a 6/10"
"Feb 06, 2010",3,Pretty much just a CG special effects movie with a mediocre story. Hayden Christiensen sucks as Anakin. What is it with George Lucas picking horrible actors to play Anakin?
"Feb 06, 2010",1,Confusing and boring.
"Feb 06, 2010",1.5,"Hated it when it first came out.  Loathed it on second showing.  Inept acting, weak script, poor directing, overall an overhyped waste of money and time."
"Feb 05, 2010",1,fuck this cgi bullshit
"Feb 05, 2010",4,"Biggest complaint about this one is probably the CGI Yoda. Really, people? That's such a problem? I thought it was pretty rad myself. Not a bad space opera. Ewan McGregor is probably the reason to watch any films in the ""new"" trilogy."
"Feb 05, 2010",3,"Its dialogue is atrocious, and its performances teeter between acceptable to hilariously bad. Nonetheless the film manages to be entertaining and exciting with better action and set pieces than Phantom of the Menace. You could basically watch any scene that isn't with Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman and come away without any complaints."
"Feb 02, 2010",3.5,"Better than the first episode in term of story, but FX looks a bit flat even comparing to the 1st episode, particularly the chase pursuit in the town, there is no comparison with Blade Runner. Cast is doing the job without being exceptional. A good movie but lack of magic."
"Feb 01, 2010",1.5,"Despite its flaws, scripting, acting, direction, overall... all of it is flawed... it is badass in its technical aspects, and that's about all that I can say to give it a rating above 0.

The end battle scene is overlong, half the characters are just ""hey this is what they looked like in the past!""... and are pointless. Hayden Christensen shouldn't have been cast. Jar-Jar Binks makes me want to vomit (although thankfully Lucas got the message and only put him in for a few scenes). Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson... are actually not that bad.

I get it, ""Green screen and digital effects are awesome!"" What Lucas set out to do was accomplished, but he has lost respect by many people for dumbing the fuck down this movie from the movies that I loved as a child and continue to love now. 

Also, the overly cliche love story can suck my balls.

Yes, this is nearly verbatim my review for Ep. 1... so Fuck You."
"Feb 01, 2010",3.5,"C'est toujours un peu compliquer a suivre entre les doubles noms des personnages et  les noms des planetes, mais la seule scenes avec Yoda sortant son sabro-laser vaut tout le film."
"Feb 01, 2010",2.5,"Dark side is approaching.... intergalactic romance, murder and mayhem, light sabers and.... my dear old green one! I guess it was time to watch this finally."
"Jan 31, 2010",1.5,"marginally better than Phantom Menace, but the ""love story"" is horrendous."
"Jan 31, 2010",2,DÃ©cidÃ©ment je ne suis pas fan ... mais je voulais le voir.
"Jan 30, 2010",3,"I think this is the strongest of the three prequels. It visually has its moments of brilliance as do all the movies. There is some funny dialogue in this one as well. C-3PO hams it up. Guess George Lucas needed someone to be the comedy relief after regulating Jar Jar to fill Senator Amidala's seat in the senate. It's just too silly. Christopher Lee is great as Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus. He is the one actor who is seasoned enough not to look puzzled throughout his performances. Regardless of the dialogue written many of the actors here just don't deliver the lines believably. Overall, an entertaining movie. These prequels may become as classic as the original trilogy, yet for different reasons."
"Jan 30, 2010",5,"Don't care, loved all of this series!!"
"Jan 30, 2010",4.5,will always be one of my favourite
"Jan 30, 2010",5,A must!! Watch it trillion times!! Fav!!
"Jan 29, 2010",4,"Great vision, but a tad formulaic.  Don't worry though, the anticipation of history's most notorious sith will keep you breathless."
"Jan 29, 2010",3,Probably my least favorite of the Star Wars movies.
"Jan 28, 2010",2.5,"Hayden Christensen's only decent acting is when he reveals that he ""killed them all. Every single one of them""."
"Jan 28, 2010",2,Terrible - only made bearable by the fact you get to see Yoda whoop some ass!
"Jan 27, 2010",4,awsome battle scenes
"Jan 27, 2010",2,"The deleted scenes on the DVD were very telling. ""We didn't include this scene that explains why the hell they're in prison 'cause there wasn't room for it."" ""We had to cut this touching piece of drama between the two lovers because there wasn't time for it."" 
I mean, I get it, you can't sell action figures of Padme and Anakin's character development, but when separating the wheat from the chaff, one ought really to keep the wheat and discard the chaff."
"Jan 26, 2010",3,"One of the worst out of the entire saga, which is a shame because the entire clone wars is such an epic story."
"Jan 26, 2010",2.5,"It's obvious George Lucas didn't have a plan for the prequels.
Lacks any hint of the ""second act"" it's supposed to be in favor of whining, complaining, and some of the worst ""love story"" dialog I've ever heard in a major film.

Also shoehorns in major plot points as almost an afterthought instead of naturally working them in."
"Jan 24, 2010",2,Måste se om för bedömning
"Jan 24, 2010",4.5,"I thought this movie delivered everything we wanted to see. Yes, the love story is garbage, but the last 45 minutes are the best in the franchise. When Yoda fights towards the end, the theatre erupted in cheers! That scene alone should propel this to the top or near it. 

As for the love story, I touched on this in my Revenge interview, but I'll take a step further.. Lucas cannot write love stories. Period. The first trilogy had a ridiculous love story between Solo and the princess. They went along teasing each other like school children!"
"Jan 24, 2010",3.5,'you should know the difference between knowledge and wisdom.'
"Jan 23, 2010",2,"Star Wars - what can you say? Do you roll with the nostalgic good feelings or the bitter realization that the Prequel Trilogy just isn't...very....good. The latter, I guess."
"Jan 23, 2010",2,hate star wars universe
"Jan 23, 2010",2.5,Pathetic acting performances not quite outweighed by the as always good special effects.
"Jan 22, 2010",4,"Esta es un poco mÃ¡s atractiva, sigue contando bastante, pero no dice mucho, sin ver la segunda trilogÃ­a no entendÃ­a nada!!!"
"Jan 22, 2010",4.5,"yikes, too bad Anakin's actor from episode one couldn't have grown enough to continue the role"
"Jan 22, 2010",3.5,"While it is a great improvement over Phantom, it still lacks a lot that makes Star Wars. Still, this movie is good enough to hold the name. Thank you Ewan for that!"
"Jan 22, 2010",3,"A slight bit better than Episode I, but adds in the stupid (though inevitable) romance subplot. The action is very well handled, but is marred by some clumsily written dialogue."
"Jan 21, 2010",1,"I honestly believe that some of the people in this film are good actors, but apparently they were paid according to how wooden they were."
"Jan 21, 2010",4,"Episode 2 had some worst moments like Anakin's whiny rants(but sometimes anakin acts like a good friend) and a corny love story. But what made episode 2 pretty good is Anakin's massacare in fromt of sand people, awesome action scenes, last 45 minutes of entertainment, and Yoda revealing his lightsaber as a great warrior."
"Jan 21, 2010",1.5,the special effects are sad... :(
"Jan 21, 2010",5,a good effort spec wen u see anakin showing his dark side after the death of his mother and how he feels the jedi r treating him a good fim by the god george lucas
"Jan 21, 2010",2.5,"The first 2/3 is pretty much garbage, but the final reel almost begins to redeem the prequel trilogy.  Almost.  Begins."
"Jan 21, 2010",3,A step up from Phantom Menace but this entry is still missing what made the originals so great to watch.
"Jan 20, 2010",2.5,"If you skip over all the scenes with Anakin and Padme the movie is not terrible. The movie is long and the dialogue is stilted (and some times just bad), but Lucas can still make a Sci-fi action movie with some witty one liners. Unfortunately he can't do emotional depth to save his life. Any scene that requires emotion, the acting, dialogue and direction take a nose dive."
"Jan 20, 2010",2.5,"Ok, this is the movie where everyone let loose! Everyone dogged on Hayden Christensen. Everyone and their brother let Lucas have it, with both barrels.
So, let us take a look at some of the things that went right with this film.
The introduction of the Fett line, aka Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett. Clearly the character of Boba Fett, introduced here in child size form, from Episode 5 is a clear fan fav. So, to get a little back story on the character here is very nice. Also, seeing that Boba, a clone of Jango, is related to every original Storm Trooper is a nice plus.
The creation of the Republic Army, soon to be the Empires, is also a nice touch here.
Christopher Lee as Count Dooku! Excellent casting here. Lee's partner in the Hammer Horror movies was non other than Peter Cushing. he was Gov. Tarkin in episode 4. This was a nice way for these 2 to be involved in one more film series! Great touch.
Again, Ewan McGregor does a fine job as Obi-Wan.
I have to agree in some respects with my friend Shawn here about Lucas' writing for teenagers. Although, if math serves, Padme is no longer a teenager, as 10 years have passed since episode 1. One only has to read Romeo &amp; Juliet. Most would agree that that dialogue is way over the top for 2 teenagers. However, it is the escapism of it all. This is happening in world we do not live in. It is a world where we believe that people can move things with their minds, have laser swords, &amp; have Wookies as friends. Yet, the words spoken between 2 lovers is not easily identifiable? Hmmmm.
Remember, there was a love story through the first trilogy, between Han &amp; Leia. It was more antagonistic, but it was there. Granted, this is no Twilight love affair, (I think I just threw up in my mouth), but it is a love affair.
I did notice that Anakins emotions played over the top, exaggerated if you will. At the outset, when he disagrees with Obi-Wan in the presence of Padme, my first instinct was, ""Why has Obi-Wan let this go on for 10 years?"".
I also understand that his emotions should be grander, as they are what lead him to the dark side, but I agree that this performance by Christensen was sub-par.
Again, taken as part of the whole story, not a terrible movie, Kurt! I only watch these as 1 continuous story."
"Jan 20, 2010",5,my favorite of the prequels!!
"Jan 19, 2010",0.5,A huge pile of crap!!!
"Jan 18, 2010",4,happens to be on tv as i'm rating it now
"Jan 18, 2010",2.5,Kinda boring sometimes.
"Jan 18, 2010",1,"Boring a shallow.  Here it is, then: The purple lightsaber and the kung-fu Yoda.  They switched between an awful puppet and bad CGI Yoda in the first, and landed on just CGI in this one (I suppose thankfully).  The problem with this new half of the franchise is that the dialogue is constantly worthless -- it sounds embarrassing, it's clunky, and it doesn't reveal anything -- the characters have almost no distinguishable traits, and the plot is too muddled and directionless to hook anyone except for diehard fans of the original trilogy who are just lying to themselves that these are good movies."
"Jan 18, 2010",2.5,this was not the best star wars film. it was anti climatic. and disapointing too. there was not much action. there was much more explanation. but i wont skip this film when i watch all the star wars films. but you should skip the christmas special. sometimes the characters can be annoying. the prequels are not the best. but for some reason c-3po gets fixed in the ending without explanation. bottomline: this film was not horrible or neither terrible. but it could have been worse.
"Jan 17, 2010",2.5,"Putting the fact the prequels are poor as standard, this was the better of the three. That mass battle with the Jedi being one of a few memorable moments. Having said that there is no excuse for pulling a made up set of prequels out of thin air, except to make money."
"Jan 17, 2010",4.5,Anakin's story continues as he is a young jedi padawan.  The movie does an incredible job in administring the drama that builds up into episode 3.  The movie is almost outstanding it's just something second acty about it.  Hayden and Natalie do outstanding as Anakin and Padme.
"Jan 17, 2010",5,"If I HAD to rank Star Wars movies from best to worst, this would probably be the forth best. That does not say a lot though. This is still a very good movie. I like the storyline between Portman and Christinsen, there is good chemistry between these two. The biggest flaw with this movie was a lack of an exciting lightsaber battle."
"Jan 16, 2010",4,"Of the whole Saga, this film is the worst.  Mainly because Anakin Skywalker is portrayed so annoyingly.  However, it's still Star Wars and the other characters save it somewhat."
"Jan 16, 2010",3.5,Now we are getting somewhere.  Love this one.
"Jan 15, 2010",1,It's a little weird.
"Jan 15, 2010",4,I love all of the Star Wars movies but this one was probably the suckiest. This movie had the epic battle of the clone wars. It begins to show how Anakin slowly starts turning into Darth Vader and why the audience is okay with it. Hayden Christensen gets really annoying but Yoda fights so that should be enough to watch it. Still an awesome movie.
"Jan 14, 2010",2.5,"The Weakest film in the franchise, period"
"Jan 14, 2010",3,"It was by my thoughts the worst Star Wars film, they could have easily put this into episode 3 and that would have made a quarter of the film, but you got to remember this was at the start of The Clone Wars."
"Jan 14, 2010",3,"Passable, but when I watch the movie now I find myself skipping through the rather droll and boring parts presented throughout the movie. Why, exactly, do we have to focus on the Anakin/Padme romance so much??? In the original trilogy, no one really ever said that Vader had a long and romantic relationship with Luke's mother! Instead of making it epic, Lucas just added a bunch of snore-worthy scenes in which Christensen and Padme are desperately trying to make fire out of a few pathetic sparks.

The effects and the fight scenes are rather good, and I applaud the fencing style brought in by Count Dooku; I always wondered if Lucas would 'smarten-up' lightsaber duels, and now he has. Let's face it-no one is really interested in watching Anakin hack-and-slash like a barbarian. Clones make their entrance in Episode II, which is pretty awesome, but their armor is unavoidably more high-tech looking than that of the 'future' armor worn by stormtroopers and portrayed in Episodes 4-6. Still, the Geonosis battle was epic and awesome, and I don't think it has an equal in ANY of the other movies, Episode III included."
"Jan 14, 2010",1,"There are only 3 Star Wars movies in my mind, and this isn't one of them!"
"Jan 14, 2010",2,"Ewan McGregor played his part well, and Christopher Lee was good, but Hayden ruined it. It was not very compelling at all. And when I ask my friends why they liked it, I hear, ""Because Jango Fett gets his head cut off."" Impressive, isn't it?"
"Jan 14, 2010",5,EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jan 13, 2010",2.5,"It is my personal opinion, but I believe that this is undoubtedly the worst Star Wars movie in the entire franchise. I believe that everything in this movie is completely watered down. The acting is way too corny, the fighting looks a little awkward, and the whole look of the movie is ehh. What was good about this movie, was obviouslly it's soundtrack which was fairly brilliant. Some of the scenes I were watching were so overly cliche. They didn't have to be that ridiculous, and I feel the acting of Hayden Christensen in this movie ruined many scenes. For some reason I feel that through the prequels of Star Wars, Natalie Portman gets better and better in acting. This movie, she's alright, and that's it. McGregor again is fine, and Samuel L Jackson, is how he always is. As far as the story goes, wow. I think that this could be the worst plot ever in a Star Wars movie. Really it takes on way too much. The film has so many things going on at once that it starts to get dull, and annoying. The romantic subplot in my opinion is terrible. The acting is too bad for it to be taken seriouslly, and I felt we could have done without a lot of it. As far as the lightsaber fight goes, it's the worst in the series. Everything looks weird until Yoda. It also feels rushed. Their isn't really much else to say about this movie. What Lucas did well was assert characters into places where it makes sense for the original series. Overall this movie is not very good. Could have been WAY better, and the worst movie in the series."
"Jan 13, 2010",0.5,this movie ruins star wars i sont care bout a lot of things anything in this movie this is considered the worst of the star wars movies and one of the worst films of all time you know it bad just skip it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jan 13, 2010",2.5,"Despite some bright moments, there's a lot about Attack Of The Clones that doesn't work for me. Continuing from Phantom Menace, annoyances are reduced somewhat and the story has more going on which is good. However, the film seems to have two main parallel storylines going on, one with Obi-Wan which is good, and unfortunately the other is the romance arc with Padme and Anakin which is pathetic. I didn't buy the build-up of their relationship, and it's kind of poorly done. Anakin is also hard to like, he's stubborn, whiny, and downright creepy. I get it's part of his character and background, but he's so cold and dull that I really couldn't sympathize with him. The film drags too long, and the grand action scenes that should be very epic don't seem that exciting. Probably just me, but I felt the digital effects in the film were far too heavy and looked more obvious to me here than Phantom Menace, so during the action scenes, I really wasn't buying it all, no one really seems to actually be where they are, and it just looks computerish and fake. I'm not judging effects of this time, visuals were good for digital, but they look silly nowadays and I get the idea that they might as well have made the whole movie CG if they were going to overbloat it with that much. It still had its moments and the speeder chase in the city was probably the film's highlight for me, even if it still was silly and ridiculously staged, as the look of the city clearly had a Blade Runner influence and captured it fairly well for a homage. Overall, the weakest entry in the series easily. Perhaps it's strange I favour Phantom Menace more, but despite that film's major flaws, I had more fun with it and managed to get more invested in it and some of its characters (hey, they lacked dimension, but I could care more for Quagon than Hayden's Anakin here) and its sad this entry couldn't be better considering how important the film is story-wise to the saga."
"Jan 13, 2010",1.5,"Somehow slightly going backwards on things that the first prequel completely failed on, ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" is not is any way a good film. We follow a grown up Anikin Skywalker as he becomes stronger and understands the ways of the force. This is the middle chunk of this story, where we begin to see the dark side of Anikin, and a foreshadow of his soon-to-be future. Again, poorly scripted, sloppy camerawork, and a dumb plot, with great visuals and very entertaining battles sequences. This film still fails in ways that I wish were different, but at least it's fun to laugh at this instalment. In the end, It's nothing special at all and quite frankly, this is arguably the worst in the entire franchise. Just an awful addition to the franchise, even by the prequel standards."
"Jan 13, 2010",3.5,Pretty Good I used to love this movie when I was little.
"Jan 13, 2010",4.5,"Everything was perfect, and I'm not a star warz person.  I loved her dress, i loved the action, i loved the vehicles, i loved ewan :)"
"Jan 13, 2010",2,"Some good performances here and there, but Christensen dooms this show."
"Jan 12, 2010",5,all star wars are great.. grin
"Jan 12, 2010",5,This is maybe my fave star wars (Cept maybe the 3rd one) cos it's when annakin and padme get together.  also i love that the clones are controlled and stuff.
"Jan 12, 2010",4.5,Far more interesting than the first of the new movies. The story is starting to reveal itself. Great true star wars scenes throughout. Again dont compare or expect the same magic as the originals - you cant.
"Jan 11, 2010",2,"compared to the other star wars films, its poo"
"Jan 11, 2010",1.5,"Hayden Christensen is worse than Jake Lloyd (if possible), and not even Ewan McGregor and Saruma-- sorry, Dracul-- sorry, Christopher Lee can save this smouldering scrap heap of a story."
"Jan 10, 2010",1.5,the worst of the lot
"Jan 10, 2010",3,"Bom, mas preferi o primeiro... Por enqto...
Curti os ""looks"" da Padme... uauahauhuah"
"Jan 10, 2010",3,"star wars : attack of the clones was a bit better than the phantom menace, and thats not saying much. annikan is older and is starting to learn the ways of a jedi and teaching him is obi wan. the casting is good and the storyline is more familiar to star wars fans. the action is superb and the effects are out of this world."
"Jan 10, 2010",3.5,"Attack of the Clones  picks up the events ten years after the successful overthrowing of the blockade put up by the Trade Federation on Planet Naboo.

The Story continues as: 

There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intensions to leave the republic.

The separatist movement under the leadership of count Dooku has made it difficult for the limited Jedi Knights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy.

Senator Amidala, the former queen of Naboo, is returning to the galactic senate to vote on the critical issue of creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC to assist the overwhelmed Jedi..

Well, Episode II was unquestionably an improvement compared to its forerunner, still there had been a feeling of expecting something more. We are introduced to teenage Jedi Anakin Skywalker well enacted by Hayden Christensen. Here we are shown some more distant parts of the galaxy and some quick look to groundwork preparation for the war against the separatist. Begin of the bond between Anakin and Amidala was well portrayed; perhaps the best part of the movie. More emphasis has been given on the action and it was well delivered while showing the battle between the droid and the clone army. We get to see some vicious galactic war machines with imposing special effects. 
As usual some comic moments are kept alive by our much loved droids R2 D2 &amp; C-3PO.

There had been a huge scope for improvement and it clearly showed in Attack of the Clones. This episode strengthened the trilogy and gave us hope. It was only matter of time to see whether Lucas was successful enough to deliver us with even more better outcome, in his next sequel thus completing the saga.

Till then may the force be with you"
"Jan 10, 2010",3,An unwatchable film full of wonderful characters and ideas.
"Jan 09, 2010",0.5,I just never got into Star Wars...More of a Star Trek fan...
"Jan 09, 2010",4.5,I own this its the bomb!
"Jan 09, 2010",2,HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN IS BLAND AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHOT AFTER THIS FILM
"Jan 09, 2010",2,"I used to think that this was my favourite Star Wars prequel. I've wanted for a long time to revisit them and as I thought this I thought ""Oh, I can't wait for Attack of the Clones. I remember that being awesome."" Well apparently it turns out that in 2002 I was high on crystal meth because ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" is unbearably awful. It's not just the over-reliance on CGI (which is the crutch that broken legged George Lucas cannot walk without), but its a complete lack of coherent narrative and likable characters. I'm not sure who is really at fault for the listless, flatter than a pancake portrayal of Anakin Skywalker. Maybe it's all because of Hayden's Christensen's 2 hour long impression of a corpse, or maybe it's Lucas' ridiculous writing. Whatever the case though any thought of the menace of Darth Vader, or the beauty of his redemption is lost in this film. Lost forever. Think of that pain and then double it as you introduce Queen Amidala. ""Oh what's her character again George? Is she the feisty chick, or the damsel in distress? What are her emotions and fears and dreams? Who is she?"" Well basically she's a queen. That's it. She has no more personality than an extension cable. Watching the supposed love scenes between those two characters is like watching bricks wrapped in cardboard repeatedly smashing against each other against a background of beige paint drying. Okay granted, I'm not just going to be negative here; this film does have a few merits. They come in three words. Ewan McGregor's beard. It's fabulous and could have a whole novelization to itself. McGregor is the only consistent thing in the prequels but he is absolutely wasted here spending all his time complaining and sending endless transmission after endless transmission. And then the action scenes. Lucas apparently likes shot after shot packed full of CGI characters and vehicles that are so dense and similarly coloured that the audience is left with a migraine. Sweet action George. I honestly think his blood now is the colour of those green screens. ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" is infuriating, irritating and pretty boring. Nice way to ruin one the greatest mythologies of the last 100 years Mr Lucas."
"Jan 08, 2010",2.5,"I have got to say, this was probably my least favorite of the series. Too much talking in my opinion, and Anakin just comes off as annoying, whiny and moody most of the time."
"Jan 08, 2010",4,"what can i say, its star wars!!"
"Jan 07, 2010",0.5,This one reminds me of when my finger poked through the toilet paper and i got shit on it. I had a smell and it immediately caused a reflex action of avoidance. So just like the smell of real shit AVOID!!!
"Jan 07, 2010",5,one of my favorites!
"Jan 07, 2010",3.5,never anything compared to the others.
"Jan 07, 2010",3.5,"Christensen brings a degree of whiny to everything he does, kind of gets on my nerves.  That said, it's still a Star Wars movie and I'm easy to please on that front."
"Jan 07, 2010",4,Darker and edgier of the Prequels.
"Jan 06, 2010",0.5,stars wars can sucks to my assmar!!!
"Jan 06, 2010",1.5,The worst of the new trilogy. And that's saying something.
"Jan 06, 2010",2.5,Awful. Hayden is absolutely horrible and personifies Lucas' stiff dialogue.
"Jan 05, 2010",1.5,Down... down... down...
"Jan 05, 2010",2.5,"æ¯ä¹ç¬¬ä¸éåç¬¬ä¸é...
å¤±æ......."
"Jan 05, 2010",2,"the pace is too slow and drag as a Sci-fi action, and its too lame to be a Sci-fi drama, failed to impress the audience on these two turf"
"Jan 05, 2010",3,"With Hayden Chritensen as Anakin Skywalker, be prepared to cringe with horrible romantic lines galore, campy and hopelessly uninspired acting and just a hammy Anakin this time around. But where the movie shines is with its barrage of effects, its entertaining action scenes and its mystery oriented dialogue between the Jedi Masters. I would've thought more highly of this film if it weren't for Hayden."
"Jan 05, 2010",4.5,superb film seen it many times i would defiantly recommend it
"Jan 05, 2010",3,Probably the weakest Star Wars film to date.
"Jan 05, 2010",3.5,"now we see exactly why yoda is a jedi master, with his mindblowing lightsabre skills"
"Jan 04, 2010",3.5,It's not too bad...but definitely the worst of the Star Wars saga
"Jan 04, 2010",2.5,"I thought it was visually great, and I first watched it when I had not seen enough movies to know terrible dialog when I heard it; and it IS terrible dialog, as I realized more recently. I still thought it was visually exciting though, and it had great music."
"Jan 04, 2010",4.5,The best part is where the clones army is dicovered with those long neck aliens...and it will be taking figure what's upon next
"Jan 04, 2010",3.5,"Not as bad as Episode I, not as good as Episode II. I loved the Jedi battle in the arena though. Acting still lacked pretty badly."
"Jan 03, 2010",3.5,"this is my least favirot of all 6 star wars movies the movie suffers from bad acting and poor characters. Hayden christenson delivers most of his lines like a poorly acted shakespearen play and they are unbeilevable. ewan mcgregor doesnt do much better but he is much more beilevible. Natalie portman in my opinion does a pretty good job. another way the movie suffers is the humor. you can tell many of the 'gags' are directed to younger viewers and not a more mature audience. the special effects are very good espicially the ships and the troops, but one of the problems is its all animated! there is barely anything real its all computer generated. i miss the old ways of star wars all the ships hand made all the sets constructed by profesinals i think they should go back to doing all movies like this. anyways back to the movie the action scenes are amazing and fast paced though and the lightsaber fights are flashy and fast.`[not always a good thing in my opinion] but oh well george lucas made up for the bad parts in th next movie [verdict not good but not great id see it to wrap up the saga and not much else]"
"Jan 03, 2010",3,"Not the hugest of Star Wars fans and always felt that the first three episodes were missing something that the older films had.

Not sure what that is but I definitely felt it.

Still a good and well made film, though."
"Jan 03, 2010",2.5,yeah..... nice try. I like it as a childrens movie i guess.
"Jan 03, 2010",3,"Not nearly as bad as Phantom Menace. The action and effects were better, the planets it took you to are cooler, no talk of midichlorians, hardly any Jar Jar, and it tied into the Star Wars story a lot more. For the most part, it has one element weighing it down. The love story. It has some of the worst ""romantic"" dialogue ever....embarassing to watch. But otherwise it's a decent fun sci-fi film that I think could be made into a 4 star film if the romance subplot was seriously edited."
"Jan 03, 2010",3.5,"Getting better, but still meh."
"Jan 03, 2010",2.5,Lame...but still it's Star Wars ;p
"Jan 03, 2010",2.5,"Reasonably exciting sequences but the everything else just doesn't have enough weight: thin character development, unengaging romance ... even the CG characters look feather-light."
"Jan 02, 2010",1.5,Lovey-dovey shit ruined this movie.
"Jan 02, 2010",2,Typical star wars movie!!
"Jan 02, 2010",5,No explanation necessary for the 5 stars.
"Jan 02, 2010",2.5,sakacenje izvrsnog serijala
"Jan 02, 2010",4.5,"Maybe it was the low expectations after Phantom, but I liked it, even with Hayden Christensen's ""acting"". Natalie Portman is hot"
"Jan 01, 2010",2.5,Pretty good except for the fact that you know how everything ends!
"Jan 01, 2010",4,"This is probably going to be the most forgotten addition of the Star Wars film series to date, purely because it acts as like a connecting part of the story. It's not one that particularly has a significant part of the saga within it, and I think after the first episode, everyone is just keen to see the moment when Anakin transforms to the dark side. Of course that doesn't happen yet, and so this is all about building that moment up. It does a good job and its Star Wars so it's an automatic thumbs up from me. My favourite part is the introduction of Jango Fett, purely because the role of Boba Fett is one of my idolised characters in the original series. I don't feel either of them have been given the screen time they deserve so that's about the only disappoint of this movie. In their defence though, it's difficult to incorporate characters as part of this knowing full well that they have to ensure it all ties in nicely to episode 4 when we get there, so there are limitations to the script they produce. It does all get a bit luvvy duvvy in this one but again we have to put that down to keeping with the story, as how else are Luke and Leia going to be produced? I'd say the most famous part of this episode is that we are showcased to a Lightsabre battle from Yoda, so often the frail leader of the Jedi council, but now at the forefront of the special effects available to the producers. It's kind of corny but everyone loves a bit of Yoda so it's bound to raise a smile or two. Other than that there's not a great deal of memorable moments but it's just a good all round feel good film that will have its profile raised (arguably higher than it should) from the franchise it is part of.  It's a must see for any fan of the series, but will no doubt go under the radar a little in comparison to the others."
"Dec 31, 2009",4,"This movie was allright, I like the cast, I like the action scenes and the fight scenes were good, but i did like the CGI they used in this movie, it was nicely done. The problems I had with this movie was that there was'nt so much action scenes like the original trilogy, and it sort of focused on the romance scenes more than the fight scenes. But this is a good star wars flick and still enjoyable for fans of the series. 83/100 = B-"
"Dec 31, 2009",0.5,"Ugh the ""new"" Star Wars episode really don't measure up to the ""old"" ones. Funny how good actors become really bad all of a sudden... a combination of bad script, bad acting and, possibly, bad directing."
"Dec 31, 2009",5,Great movie probobly one my favorite from the star wars series
"Dec 31, 2009",3,better than Episode 1
"Dec 31, 2009",3.5,hayden christiansen :) its a shame he cant act or else he would be perfect lmao
"Dec 31, 2009",3.5,"A marked improvement over the previous film reduces Jar Jar's appearance and creates a much more even tone of seriousness which solidifies the story, drawing the viewer in even more as they make connections to the original trilogy.  Some of the action can be tepid and the romance dialogue is honestly painful at times owing to the two lovers' wooden delivery and/or poorly written dialogue (scenes like these are mostly excised in Episode III).  Always interesting and promising of what is yet to come."
"Dec 30, 2009",1,"i... really wish i never saw this... but out of the prequels, this was the least horrible"
"Dec 30, 2009",3,"Si La réal parait un peu négligée, si certain partis pris peuvent répugner, cet épisode reste pourtant joussif par moment, c'est tout de même mieux que l'épiode 6."

"Dec 29, 2009",3.5,A solid movie thats better than the first but still feels lacking of that Star Wars substance we got in the original trilogy.
"Dec 29, 2009",4,pretty good movie although the dialogue could've been better
"Dec 29, 2009",2,"Not sure why people think this film is better than the first: the narrative is even further pieced together, and McGregor is left to carry the film by himself.  By the time Yoda was flying around the screen, my eyes were rolled-out.  Oh, by the way, they can't get their hands on these secret plans cough cough."
"Dec 28, 2009",2.5,You know it as well as I do. This the the worst Star Wars movie of all 6.
"Dec 28, 2009",2.5,I wouldn't call Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones an improvement over the first installment of the new trilogy. This film is very immature and just doesn't have much to offer other than the Star Wars name in its title.
"Dec 28, 2009",3.5,"Star warsk so many elements, who could go wrong. Thanks George."
"Dec 28, 2009",3.5,Better than the first prequel and almost equal with Episode III.

"Dec 27, 2009",3.5,not as good as the others
"Dec 27, 2009",2.5,"Never reached the extremes of Ep 1 (lightsaber duel - brillant, Jar jar - awful), just not very good"
"Dec 27, 2009",0.5,"Why did this ever have to be made? The dialogue is bad, the characters uninteresting, the battle scenes repetitive and the story is incomprehensibly terrible."

"Dec 25, 2009",2.5,"not as good as the first trilogy. The problem was, there was no relatable everyman character int he movies. No Han Solo."
"Dec 24, 2009",2,"Melodrama and immaturity bring down an otherwise interesting plot. Ewan McGregor is forced into the awkward position of having to make up for the rest of the cast and there is never a true turnaround.

"Dec 24, 2009",2.5,"The new ""Star Wars"" take themselves far too seriously."
"Dec 24, 2009",3.5,yes yes im a nerd get over it
"Dec 23, 2009",1.5,"Relieving myself on the remaining copies of this film would make it smell better than the story that was put together for this one. I can summarize it all by calling it this: ""Star Wars- The Love Story,"" and you know what- it would still sound better than ""Attack of the Clones"". Thankfully we don't have to deal with the pandering towards a children's audience with Jar Jar Binks, but that doesn't stop them from wrecking Boba Fett's backstory by revealing it all to us. What we're treated to next is particularly stiff acting from Hayden Christensen - but who's acting wouldn't appear this way next to the likes of Jackson, McGregor, and Lee, which is all that redeems this film from the depths that Episode One sunk to."
"Dec 23, 2009",3.5,It's getting there...but George was too obseesed with CGI..still the plot was good and the action second to none..still it was missing something!
"Dec 23, 2009",4,"After watching the first one, I had to watch the second one. Well, the second one was basically like the first one except different storyline, it was very boring at the beginning then it got better and better with a climax. I enjoyed watching the action, and special effects. 

Recommended Audience-People who love movies with more than one part, a series movie. People who love great storylines and future sci-fi.

"Dec 23, 2009",3.5,the end fighting scene was what made this movie. didnt care for the bland little love conflict with padme and anakin. I obviously prefer the original saga over these....i dunno.. i dont wanna say monstrosities...cuz i love star wars...but when i see them on tv i wont sit and watch it ill just watch the good parts.which for me. is just the ending.

"Dec 22, 2009",2.5,The worst out of all six in my opinion but still watchable especially when Jango Fett is on screen :]
"Dec 21, 2009",2.5,Natalie Portman gets 2 stars just herself.
"Dec 21, 2009",3.5,"I thought it was good, but I think they should have shown more of the ' Clone Wars ' in the movie."
"Dec 20, 2009",3.5,"Aside from Ewan Mcgregor, Teumera Morrison, and Christopher Lee, the acTING SUCKS! Portman and Hayden are despicable actors. But I still LOVE it. This was the point in my life where I STARTED to think, ""maybe the prequels are better than the originals"", but that is a very stupid thought.

Review by Fraser Green

The next edition to the Star Wars franchise consists of poor acting, a bad script and very isolated action sequences. The lightsaber duel at the end  apart from Master Yoda and Count Dooku  is less than impressive, but the only thing that makes this film worth watching is the progression of Anakins journey to the dark side, and the fact that it is a Star Wars film! Needs to be seen, but poorly made.

Rating: 5/10

"Dec 20, 2009",3,"Barring the dreary romance aspect, AOTC was a great film. Loved the duel between Yoda and Count Dooku."
"Dec 19, 2009",3,Better than Episode 1
"Dec 19, 2009",1,the abosolute worst one of the entire saga
"Dec 19, 2009",3,"Set ten years after the events of ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"", not only has the galaxy undergone significant change, but so have our familiar heroes Obi-Wan Kenobi, Padme Amidala, and Anakin Skywalker, as they are thrown together again for the first time since the Trade Federation invasion of Naboo. Anakin has grown into the accomplished Jedi apprentice of Obi-Wan, who himself has transitioned from student to teacher. The two Jedi are assigned to protect Padme whose life is threatened by a faction of political separatists. As relationships form and powerful forces collide, these heroes face choices that will impact not only their own fates, but the destiny of the Republic."
"Dec 19, 2009",4,best among d second trilogy!
"Dec 18, 2009",2,Would rather watch paint dry for about half of the movie.
"Dec 18, 2009",3,"The Light Sabre fight between Yoda and Palpatine,a classic!!"
"Dec 18, 2009",2.5,"Good in overall plot development, but sucky in everything else"
"Dec 17, 2009",3,"Long, long movie, almost to the point ur like, god damn just get on with it already. But decent, probably my least favorite of all 6."
"Dec 17, 2009",3,"Of course nothing can beat the original tirlogy. If that's what people are whining about, what did you expect?"
"Dec 16, 2009",0.5,Once again another dissapointment. I meen if Hayden Christensen acted like he did in Jumper maby it would have been good.
"Dec 16, 2009",5,who wouldnt luv star wars?
"Dec 15, 2009",3.5,Star Wars recovered from the PHANTOM MENACE and gave the world another good Star Wars movie. It had alot of action and fun all packed in one. There were some weird parts but it was still a watchable movie.
"Dec 14, 2009",3.5,and i thought episode one was the worst then came this one and boy was i wrong
"Dec 14, 2009",3.5,not like the older star wars
"Dec 12, 2009",3,So dumb but so funny!
"Dec 12, 2009",5,Star Wars is awesome!
"Dec 12, 2009",4.5,"There are so many reasons why I loved this movie:
-It's Star Wars
-It has Hayden Christensen in it
-It's got Natalie Portman in it
-I loved the romantic subplot"
"Dec 12, 2009",2.5,Worst installment of the saga.
"Dec 12, 2009",1.5,"""I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. Not like you. You're soft and smooth.""-Anakin Skywalker

Fucking seriously? This counts as dialogue?"
"Dec 10, 2009",4.5,amazing battles ok lead up to the third but my favorite battle on genosis is my fav of all movies plus yoda does something I was impressed by kamino all the things that happened there were fantastic
"Dec 10, 2009",3.5,This movie is much better than the Phantom Menace
"Dec 09, 2009",4,"Anakin Skywalker shares a forbidden romance with Padmé Amidala while his teacher, Obi-Wan Kenobi, makes an investigation of a separatist assassination attempt on Padmé which leads to the discovery of a secret Republican clone army"
"Dec 09, 2009",5,NAUM TEM COMO STAR WARS Ã MOITO PERFEITOOOOOOOOO *___*
"Dec 09, 2009",3,"Now that we have our hopes shattered after episode one, the hype factor was not as huge. Amongst all the angst, romance and video game style action sequences there is a good film trying to burst out, which you only see glimpses of in the last half hour."
"Dec 09, 2009",5,Order 66 still makes me cry
"Dec 09, 2009",4,"While yea the romance aspect of it is a bit hookey and hard to stand sometimes, it's starting resemble a star wars movie"
"Dec 08, 2009",1,"Okay, so Episode I did not exactly live up to the hype. Outside of a really cool villain in Darth Maul and some interesting effects and ideas, The Phantom Menace introduced a character that would have had no place in the original trilogy (Jar Jar Binks), turned Anakin Skywalker into a ridiculously cheery and annoying slave (thank YOU Jake Lloyd and no I don't want fries with that) and made having Jedi powers into nothing more than having contaminated blood. 

Episode II: Attack of the Clones did not exactly need to be a masterpiece to build upon that in the eyes of most Star Wars fans (even though I may have sounded bitter right there, I actually enjoyed Episode I for the most part), it just needed to be better. In the eyes of this guy, you know the one with the face, not only did it not exceed Episode I, it managed to be worse and break the tradition of trilogies where the second is always the best. Attack of the Clones, out of all six, is the worst Star Wars movie ever. EVER.

George Lucas in all due honesty should have gotten someone else to direct the prequels, because in the time between directing gigs (20-something years I believe?) not only did he get rusty, but he also forgot that in order for people to act, they need to be able to see something tangible. Like the rest of the prequels, the actors spend their time in front of green screens pretending to react to a variety of ILM-created CGI that was added in post-production. It is noticable, and the overload of special effects (intangible stuff especially) is grating and makes a movie that is not even realistic in the first place seem LESS realistic.

Attack of the Clones gives us Hayden Christiansen taking Anakin to a whole new whiny level. People sometimes like to tell me ""HE CAN ACT IN OTHER FILMS!"" but if you see the other work he's done that get's praised (Shattered Glass, Life as a House) he plays a whiny character, just a more believable and less annoying kind. That's his schtick, and Lucas does not reign it in, he probably even made him up the ante. Anakin in Episode II is mopy, whiny, complains a lot, gets overemotional, and is the male Bella Swan from the Twilight series. Every time he is on-screen I cringed and I'm cringing even remembering it. This was one of his first big gigs, and it shows...oh god it shows.

His ""chemistry"" with supposed love interest Padme Amidala is laughable at best, pathetic at worst. The film does not make me believe they are in love in the slightest, and since that's apparently the crux of his whole dark side turn, that's a pretty bad con to have in AOTC. Natalie Portman otherwise does okay, but even though she's a trained actress, Lucas makes her into a bumbling annoying idiot.

Episode II had very good few parts, but enough to keep me from giving it a zero. The Yoda fight scene is pretty intense, if a bit short, and although it's distracting, the CGI is damned impressive when you consider how long ago this film was made. Avatar it ain't, but for its time, absolutely stunning. 

Ian McDirmand, as Palpatine, continues to be the only one in the film actually trying. Being the character for so long, he understands it and being a veteran he can transcend the lack of direction from Lucas and create gold out of nuggets of crap. Ditto for Ewan McGregor (Obi Wan) and Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu), who manage to have their characters save face in such stupid situations.

I know that many think this is a vast improvement, but I would take the boredom of Episode I over this steaming pile of annoying crap any day of the week. Even as the years have gone on, I haven't been able to get myself to watch this, and I doubt I ever will. If you are going to be a massochist and watch the Prequel trilogy, get some LSD or glue to dull the pain of Attack of the Clones."
"Dec 08, 2009",5,This movie was hilarious!!!  I love how Anakin's mom's name is... wait for it... SHMI!!! lol
"Dec 08, 2009",2.5,"A decent well-made Star Wars film! Great effects and a fine addition to the saga. The romance seems to slow the film down massively and the dialogue is quite shaky at parts. Nevertheless, the film's action sequences makes it a worthwhile watch!"
"Dec 07, 2009",0.5,this was such a bad movie
"Dec 07, 2009",3.5,Only because Natalie Portman is Gorgeous
"Dec 07, 2009",1,between 1983 and 2000 somebody must have really hit Lucas over the head.. sad...
"Dec 07, 2009",3,Lo único que hace significativa para mi esta película es la pelea de Yoda...
"Dec 06, 2009",0.5,"Boo!  Put this one on your 'Skip' list, for certain."
"Dec 06, 2009",3,Poorly written.....sorry George Lucas its okay though I still love you I mean come on you created the best stories of all time!
"Dec 05, 2009",3.5,Only just better than ep 1 thanks mainly to the start of the clone wars and Yoda getting his lightsaber out.
"Dec 05, 2009",1.5,"Truly terrible, Hayden Christensen is one of the worst actors out there. He's about as convincing as a wooden spatula."
"Dec 03, 2009",3.5,"I loved from the first time I saw it.  Not the best, but not quite the worst."
"Dec 03, 2009",1.5,"Worst Star Wars movie, thank you Hayden Christianson"
"Dec 02, 2009",2,"This is the worst in the saga, as it is too mushy and the acting is wooden. But it is made up for in special effects."
"Dec 02, 2009",0.5,muck.mc gregor again
"Dec 01, 2009",3,"The Film Is Great But To My Opinion Is The Worst In The Series but the movie is still good. shure the chase scene was awsome so was some fights and yoda kick ass in the film. all i can say is that the movie has a good feeling with it but not as good as what the original series had, the hype phantom menace had, and the great ending Revenge of the sith had but all in all great movie!"
"Dec 01, 2009",3.5,Star Wars fan. But give me the original ones to rate already!
"Dec 01, 2009",2,Definitely the worst of the Star Wars movies.   The acting / scripting is TERRIBLE.    Forced love story FAILS.
"Dec 01, 2009",3,"Definitely the low point of the series. Hayden Christensen is painful to watch sometimes. But Ewan MacGregor makes up for it mostly, and the long-awaited Yoda lightsaber battle is just sweet."
"Nov 30, 2009",1,"Featuring planet Earth's least enjoyable screen presence, Hayden Chr.. I mean Jar Jar Binks. Thanks a lot George."
"Nov 30, 2009",4,I remeber seeing this when I was younger. It was a great sequel!
"Nov 30, 2009",4,Best of the NEW Star Wars
"Nov 30, 2009",1.5,Maybe this is the worst Star Wars episode ever!!!?
"Nov 29, 2009",1,I REALLY did not like the choice for Anakin (sp?)
"Nov 29, 2009",2.5,Definitely dumber and weaker than The Phantom Menace.
"Nov 29, 2009",4,Thank you for Star Wats George Lucas.
"Nov 29, 2009",2.5,This is by far the weakest of all six movies...
"Nov 29, 2009",4,A great movie with tons of action.
"Nov 29, 2009",2,best from new trillogy...
"Nov 29, 2009",3,The second prequel ends kind of abruptly and builds on a story that is already easy to predict by nature of pre-history. Great if you are part of the cult!!
"Nov 29, 2009",4.5,amazing movie. george lucas is amazing
"Nov 28, 2009",3.5,Hayden Christensen may be easy on the eyes but his acting abilities are severely lacking. My boyfriend was the one who initially brought this up...but how could the casting be so off on the main character?  Especially on a movie with an enormous cult following like star wars??!!!  Almost unforgivable
"Nov 28, 2009",1.5,This is why Darth Maul needed to survive.  Because you build a movie on Lucas doing romance dialogue and it's going to be sucktastic.
"Nov 28, 2009",0.5,"I have to admit, I was so non emotionally involved in these movies, thought the acting was so poor, and got so confused by all of the different characters.   Bad George!"
"Nov 27, 2009",2.5,The weakest Star Wars movie in the series.  Almost had no general purpose in the saga.
"Nov 27, 2009",2.5,"though this COULD HAVE BEEN so much better, i'm pretty confident in the fact that this was the best of the prequels."
"Nov 27, 2009",3,"hmmm not his best, but entertaining moments"
"Nov 27, 2009",2.5,"Better than episode 1 but still not good.I canot get past Hayden Christensen's horrific acting,it is some of the worst acting I have evere seen.Christopher Lee steals the show as protraying Count Dooku.The film is just ok."
"Nov 27, 2009",0.5,It was downhill after Episode I
"Nov 26, 2009",2.5,"While it is a significant improvement over The Phantom Menace, Episode II still falls short in several areas. The pacing is better, but still feels off balance at times. To be perfectly honest, I used to loathe this movie but after this most recent viewing, I can see that lessons were learned from the countless mistakes made in Episode I. The acting is wooden and most of the dialogue is just as bad, but the story is more focused and there are a handful of moments that carry that genuine Star Wars feel. If not for a few god-awful eye rolling scenes, This could have been a decent movie."
"Nov 26, 2009",5,by far the best star wrs film ever after star war 4
"Nov 26, 2009",3,"Meh, drama.
Ooh, Boba Fett's story!"
"Nov 26, 2009",1,Everything about film pissed me off.  But it's still not as bad as the first.  But that still won't rise it up above a single star.
"Nov 25, 2009",3,"The film focuses on Anakin's trail to becoming his ultimate destiny: Darth Vader. It's not very interesting and all we ultimately get out of every little thing that happens is Anakin ends up very mad. Yes, it's an almost pointless movie.

But what makes up for all this silliness is everything the jedi do. But as cool as the fights get, it isn't the traditional, original style."
"Nov 25, 2009",5,I FREAKING LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!! STAR WARS FOR LIFE!!!!!
"Nov 25, 2009",3.5,Can't say I like the new ones as much as I like the originals...
"Nov 25, 2009",3,attack of the clones is really hated by fan and critcs alike but to me all i think is how hard a time it has with the fact it is stuck between 1 and 3 plus it shows the start of the clone wars so thats a hard thing to stand up to seeing as how it was spoken about in a new hope by old ben plus i have to say the whole jango fett thing was weird but needed for the fans to finally get a dose of fett and the kid playing him was ok not as annoying as jar jar or kid annie and i love the clone wars fight at the end of the film
"Nov 25, 2009",1,"Saying this movie is better than The Phantom Menace is saying very little, as most movies are better than Episode 1. However, most movies are better than this one too. The acting, dialogue, story etc. aren't even laughably bad; they're cover your eyes and ears in horror bad. The only improvement it makes over its predecessor is that it feels more consistent with the original trilogy; but this creates a whole new problem, as it actually taints my opinion of the old ones. The Star Wars prequels continue to destroy an immortal cinematic legacy."
"Nov 24, 2009",2,"Released three years after The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones is worst than its predecessor. Why? It has the same structure than Phantom Menace, only this time it's no surprise. By that I mean, long dialogue sequences, some litte action scenes throughout the first half of the movie and a huge action scene/lightsaber-battle at the end of the movie. 

The acting has got a little better. Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee deliver the best lines and give the best performances out of all the cast, which is sad when you have such talented actors like Samuel L.Jackson. Hayden Christensen is bad as Anakin, he shows no emotion, he's whiny and even when he's angry is bad. The action and the special are the only good things about this movie. The special effects are astonishing, the CGI characters are well made etc. 

This movie was made for the new generation of Star Wars fan, the old Star Wars fans are propably going to be disappointed (I'm pretty sure they already are), normal moviegoers will asked themselves after watching this: ""What was that?"" 

As Yoda would say:"" Skip this you should."""
"Nov 24, 2009",3,One of the worst in the franchise yet it has the most action.
"Nov 23, 2009",3.5,"Definitely the worst one in the series, sadly :("
"Nov 23, 2009",3,second to worst star wars
"Nov 23, 2009",2.5,Somewhat watchable.  Even as a huge sci fi fan I found this luke warm.  Lucas has no idea how to create dialogue or what constitutes annoying characters.  The battle scenes were the saving grace of this film.  I also thought there was too much delay between each movie.
"Nov 23, 2009",4.5,"One of the better in the saga, even though most hate this one the most.  This one is absolutely fantastic."
"Nov 23, 2009",4,Hayden Christensen's bad acting knows no bounds.  On another note George Lucas has hard time writing romatic scenes.
"Nov 22, 2009",2,The second film in the fail filled second trilogy finds Anakin and Padme falling in love with the looming clone wars in the background.
"Nov 22, 2009",5,Ive seen everyone of these and there really great films 5*
"Nov 22, 2009",3.5,"Nonostante Episodio 1 sia stato un successone al boxoffice il film nn ha convinto tutti sopratutto i fan piu' accaniti. Abbandonate le vesti e i toni giovanili Lucas ci riprova raccontando un tema nuovo e affascinante per la sua saga: l amore passionale e proibito. Il secondo episodio infatti risulta essere piu' maturo come se  crescesse insieme al protagonista Anakin. E proprio l amore e' il tema pincipale del film che, nonosante risulti ancora molto schiavizzato da effetti speciali mirabilianti , questa volta funziona meglio in ogni settore. Infatti si ha l idea che piano piano Lucas stia collegando tutti i tasselli della sua ormai Esalogia. I riferimenti alla vecchia trilogia (piu' o meno forzati) sono sempre piu' frequenti e aiutano a chiarire la psicologia dei personaggi. Un film che sebbene abbia il peso di essere di passaggio diverte ed emoziona e testimonia ancora una volta la grande fantasia e bravura  di Lucas e del suo team. La Forza comincia a riscorrere!"
"Nov 22, 2009",3,"Anakin is portrayed as an mono-toned emo, these prequels really needed better actors. Although this movie lagged in some places, it was much better than The Phantom Menace."
"Nov 22, 2009",1,Should have quit after the first three films.
"Nov 22, 2009",4,Better than Episode I but still lacks conviction.
"Nov 20, 2009",5,i rank it as the least best but its still amazing! lol
"Nov 20, 2009",3,"Much like its predecessor, Episode II of the Star Wars saga is enjoyable, but once again doesn't compare to the quality of the original trilogy.  

Taking place ten years after the events of Episode I, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is now 20 years old and the apprentice of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).  Anakin, who is unusually powerful in the Force, displays signs of arrogance and impatience.  After a failed assassination attempt on now Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), the two are ordered to investigate and protect her.  Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) builds a military force to protect against a separatist movement led by former Jedi Count Dooku (Christopher Lee).  When Obi-Wan discovers the creation of a massive clone army on planet Kamino, a battle erupts in the conflict between the clones and Jedi against Dooku's droids.

I wasn't sure how Hayden Christensen would work as Anakin Skywalker.  I must say though, his performance is really solid.  It's very interesting noticing certain points in the film where his anger is present, foreshadowing his eventual turn to the Dark Side.  Natalie Portman returns as Amidala, and she's just kind of ""there.""  The character isn't particularly strong, but it does work.  I also really liked Ewan McGregor returning as a much more seasoned Obi-Wan Kenobi.

It's the story, unfortunately, that is the major weakness of this film.  It's not that it's bad, but it's just not very engaging.  There are certain aspects that are really good, but for the most part it drags.  Once again, the visuals are outstanding, really utilizing the technology of the time.  The CGI is a bit overblown at times though, making it seem almost cartoon-like.  The last 15 minutes of this film are very intense, making up for the previous mishaps.  You can't help but be interested in seeing how Anakin's transformation will culminate.  Episode II doesn't compare to the original films, but it is a respectable entry into the saga.  3 stars."
"Nov 20, 2009",3,the battles are good but the movie falls flat in many other places.
"Nov 20, 2009",1.5,"If you program your DVD player to skip all the chapters dealing with the so-caled love story, the movie is almost watchable. Almost."
"Nov 19, 2009",0.5,Attack of the clowns more likely.
"Nov 19, 2009",5,"Awesome action, secound favorite out of all six"
"Nov 19, 2009",1,this walker is the worst one ever. at least the kid who played anikin could act better than christensen
"Nov 19, 2009",4,"It was a fun movie, but it tended to drag at times. It had an amazing last hour, the Geonosis battle was really well done. The first hour or so of the movie had very little importance to the overall plot. The acting was so-so, I really don't feel that George Lucas concerns himself with the little things which really hurts the film. I think that if he would've taken his time with this, it would've been a better overall product."
"Nov 18, 2009",3,It was alright I mean it was cool but too much of a romance movie focusing on anakin and Padme 2 much
"Nov 18, 2009",3.5,"Episode 2 is a Star Wars film that struggles in some dramatic moments but is well compensated for by its overall vision.

The focus slowly shifts to Anakin Skywalker, who was introduced in Episode 1 as a brave and determined child, and is now a teenager. He has grown impatient and angry, which is exacerbated by the loss of his mother. But as Quai Gon Gin (his first mentor) had explained in Episode 1, he is the chosen one; the one to bring balance to the forces between good and evil.

This is all portrayed reasonably well by actor Hayden Christensen. However, the onscreen romance shakes in the plots requirement for a relationship to evolve between his character and Padme, the Queen of Naboo. It is not so much the acting but the mundane dialogue between them. 

But looking aside, the spectacle of a galactic crisis continues. The wars between separatists and the republic escalate. A large unclaimed army of clone soldiers is discovered. And the purpose behind their creation is unclear. 

Coruscant is shown in closer detail with its high flying traffic of ships and cruisers. The rocky Planet Geonosis is introduced and later sets the stage for one of the bigger battlefields in the film series. And the surreal Camino has a breathtaking sight of a military base that sits above an ocean under constant rainfall. 

The Star War films achieve greatness in their narrative, but also in its smaller segments. The light saber duels are an example. To see these death matches is to observe a deadly clash between two kinds of forces, principles, and beliefs. The sabers emit a plasma beam that can slice through steel, sever limbs, and can instantly cauterize wounds. There is intensity in these battles that exist in its own plain.

When the credits roll, Episode 2 has delivered plenty. Like episode 1, it differs from the other chapters due to its seriousness. But we slowly see the transformation of Anakin and the corruption of a galactic republic. And for the avid science fiction viewer, this should be terrific entertainment."
"Nov 17, 2009",4.5,"Better than Episode 1.
You get the Star Wars feeling allready!"
"Nov 16, 2009",4,It starts much better than episode I...and then it keeps going that way. It shows just enough of Anakins evil side. It's a good build up for episode III
"Nov 16, 2009",4,"Much better than episode one. But Anakin and Amidala romping around the grass was a tad too much lah.

pppffftt."
"Nov 16, 2009",4,"Attack Of The Clones

Continuing from the phantom menace , attacking of the clones focuses on the beginning on the clone wars and the romance that lead to the formation of darth vadar.

Pros

   1. Soundtrack amazing
   2. custumes
   3. removal of jar jar character
   4. beuatiful film to look at
   5. unintentionally funny cringe worthly dialogue between anakin and padme
   6. Ewan Mcgregor as obi-wan

Cons

   1. weak script full of plot holes
   2. anakin skywalker came across as a whiny brat and a poor casting choice
   3. acting could easily be imporved
   4. special effects taking over the stroy
   5. all lightsabar duels could have been improved
   6. yoda vs count dooku lghtsabor duel should never of happened
   7. C-3PO was annoying

Even with the problems in the film i still enjoyed watching the film

"Nov 15, 2009",5,i just like looking at hayden christensen
"Nov 14, 2009",2,"Features some of the worst chemistry between two attractive hollywood actors in history, generating one of the most distasteful and poorly acted romances in history. Which is served nicely with a plodding pace over the course of an over long running time that begs to question, is the final battle sequence even worth it?"
"Nov 14, 2009",2.5,"I just don't like SW..sry..2,5 Stars."
"Nov 13, 2009",1,"Awful, awful film. Everytime I watch it, I only watch the combat scenes. The romance between Anakin and Padme is pathetic, lacks any of the adorable comedy that Han Solo and Leia's had.
Hayden Christensen's acting is truely appaling, having only two emotions: Pissed off and annoyingly bad impression of happiness occasionally.
The only good thing is that they reduced Jar Jar's appearances in the film."

"Nov 11, 2009",2,"My least favourite Star Wars. Not as annoying as Episode 1, but rather forgettable."
"Nov 11, 2009",2,"It answers questions from the original story line and leaves the last details for Episode Three to uncover but in my opinion, Attack of The Clones is the weakest of the Star Wars saga.  I don't like Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, he has about as much acting talent as a lamp post and is not good enough to make the part interesting.  Christopher Lee is always worth watching and he does well enough here as Count Dooku, we are also introduced to Jango Fett, the father of original storyline bounty hunter Boba Fett, acted terribly by Temuera Morrison.  The main highlight in this movie is seeing Master Yoda wield his light saber at the end.  We do begin to see the dark side showing itself in Anakin Skywalker by the end of the movie and it does set up the final installment nicely but as with The Phantom Menace, it's not good enough to be classed in the same category as any of the original Star Wars movies, which is a great great shame."
"Nov 11, 2009",2,"Unadulterated crap. Darn you, George Lucas."
"Nov 11, 2009",2,The only good part is Obi Wan's detective story with the clones. The acting is horrible with the exception of McGregor.

"Nov 09, 2009",3.5,better than the first one but not as good as empire
"Nov 09, 2009",2,"Slightly better than the first film - its still poor considering how good the actors in it can actually be and the staggering budget avilable.

Most amusing how the ""Offical Critics"" continue to score these three prequals better than the below average B movies they actually are............ guess it does not do to upset Mr Lucas.

To me its faults include the plot, the wooden characterisation, the ""comedy elements"" - it would be better to look at how many of the ""kids"" animated films handle humour that can please both adults and children.

Its a shame considering how good the original proper Star Wars films are."

"Nov 04, 2009",2,I only liked Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor
"Nov 04, 2009",2.5,"Yes, I have given Star Wars: Episode II a lower rating than its predecessor. And yes, I know I should probably hang for it in the eyes of some viewers. But the fact is, Episode II of the Star Wars saga has to be my LEAST favorite of all the movies. I just find this installment extremely boring beyond relief. I can't stand the way the love story between Padme and Anakin was portrayed in this movie. I felt they focused on it way too much and made the movie just boring. The only saving grace that Attack of the Clones has the saved it from a lower rating is the final battle/fight sequences. These are the best moments in the movie by far and are quite entertaining."
"Nov 04, 2009",4,Hayden is one of the worse actors in the biz. But Star Wars is amazing and Ewan McGregor makes the movie.
"Nov 04, 2009",2,It somehow fail to impress me as I thought there was something lacking about the true Star Wars theme!
"Nov 04, 2009",4,dragged my mam to see this with me she hated it of course and i loved it. was worth the wait to see yoda kick asssssss
"Nov 03, 2009",2,"I liked Star Wars: Attack of the Clones less then Phantom Menace, as it seems like just a filler movie, as we are all waiting for the 3rd installment and seeing the completion of Anakin going to the Darkside. 

I found the acting horrible in places, even Ewan McGregor was bad and he is the most solid actor in the whole of the 1st trilogy. The boy who played Boba Fett, and the actor who played Jango Fett are simply the worst I have seen on screen, it was embarassing at times! 

It has a story that could have been left out, and it created villians out of no-where. What happened to their is only to Dark Lords, a Master and his apprentice? 

This movie really focuses on the love story of Anakin and Padme but even that is weird, seeing how young he was in the first film and that she hasn't aged a bit from the 1st - 2nd film. Are we meant to believe that she just didn't age? 

I didn't feel the special effects were up to normal standard either, the fight scene at the end between Anakin and the beasts was just badly done and some of the creatures looked so fake. 

Still the action is good, and that is about it, and we finally get to see Yoda in action which was all good fun. But really just an average film. Still Star Wars is Star Wars and you do feel entertained even if sometimes it was painful to watch.   

Directing - 15/20
Preformances - 5/20 
Visual/Special Effects - 8/20 
Musical Score - 10/20

48% - It's an average film, with bad acting, same old stuff where it leaves us all waiting for the 3rd film!"
"Nov 02, 2009",0.5,the worst in the series so bad i rather watch the christmas special. nothing fucking happens in this film and it is boring as all hell.Not to mention has really dull actng and the you don't car for any o the characters.

"Nov 01, 2009",3.5,A slight improvement over the first with a well written script telling the story in immense detail and one of the best light saber battles in the series plus an epic battle make this one stunning story.
"Nov 01, 2009",0.5,Wow.  This was horrible.  I needed to throw up.
"Oct 31, 2009",1,I fell asleep in the cinema. 'Nuff said. My only disappointment at falling asleep was I missed the comedy Yoda fight.
"Oct 31, 2009",3.5,"AOTC is more enjoyable that its predecessor due to its emphasis on adventure and action and it's development on the relationship between Obi-wan and Anakin. The films still lacks a strong plot, and the dialogue is particularly flat at times - chiefly in the romantic subplot between Padme and Anakin -  and many of the names, situations and characters feel less intimate and heartwarming as the ones in the Original films did. However it's still has some entertainment value with its exciting action sequences and some more delving into the backstory of the Star Wars mythos. A solid, if not lackluster entry."
"Oct 31, 2009",3,Episode II Was... Terrible. Probably because Hayden was so bad.
"Oct 31, 2009",5,"Regardless of what others might say, I liked the movie."
"Oct 30, 2009",2,"THIS IS NOT STAR WARS!

Worst of all the Star Wars films, by far.  It has some OK parts near the end but for the most part, it's Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman (who I usually like), and a ton of cheese.  And not good cheese like in the original films.  Bad, old, rotten cheese.  Don't watch it unless you're trying to get the back story before Episode 3."
"Oct 30, 2009",3,"hmm, there is worse..."
"Oct 29, 2009",2,"Plot holes filled, we find out Anakin's an insecure momma's boy.

Only thing worth seeing in this film was Yoda's fight seen near the end."
"Oct 29, 2009",2,Yegads! Where's Irvine Kershner when you need him?
"Oct 29, 2009",3.5,"Without the love story, it would have been a hell of a lot better."
"Oct 28, 2009",4,a good continuation of the begining trilogy.
"Oct 28, 2009",0.5,"I took my lil bros to see this, waste of time and money, anakin cannot act, sappy bullshit love scenes, fucking god awful boring politics....die Gearge Lucas die!!! you'll be fucking around with Indy soon....wait....."
"Oct 27, 2009",1.5,Hayden Christensen made Darth vader un-cool. i hate him.
"Oct 27, 2009",2,"Easily the worst of the bunch the
ending isn't bad though as we get to see the Jedi kicking as finally."
"Oct 26, 2009",3.5,"Yeah, it was worth the time to watch it - great CG wok."
"Oct 25, 2009",1.5,Haha... I don't know what this movie was but.
"Oct 25, 2009",3.5,I like the love story in it.
"Oct 25, 2009",3.5,Bad acting but great story and action.
"Oct 25, 2009",3,"What's wrong with the first film? This is not an improvement, this is a step down. This film did not leave us in enough turmoil."
"Oct 25, 2009",2,My dad's obsessed with these movies!
"Oct 25, 2009",3,chemistry si anakin sama amidala kuraaangg.... but overall.. okay... I think Hayden Christensen is a good cast for anakin skywalker...
"Oct 24, 2009",5,"This movie showcases the beginning of Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side.  While some people complain about the prequels, I found them to be a fantastic expansion on the Star Wars universe.  There are some very talented actors here such as Christopher Lee, Ewan McGregor, and Ian McDiarmid.  I for one thought that Count Dooku was a much better ""bad guy"" than Darth Maul from Episode 1.  Lee brings such a sophistication to the role which makes Dooku that much cooler.  Portman once again looks amazing.  The effects are outstanding for the most part and the battle on Geonosis was awesome to watch."
"Oct 23, 2009",0.5,probably one of the 5 worst movie I have ever seen
"Oct 23, 2009",5,"love it, best movie ever. makes me cry everytime, love the anakin and padme relationship(:"
"Oct 23, 2009",3,yeah well..never gonna compare to the original trio but somewhat better than the one just before it
"Oct 22, 2009",1,"Poor Christopher Lee, how terribly you were misused."
"Oct 22, 2009",5,awsome star wars is my shit !!!
"Oct 22, 2009",3.5,"Seguindo a 'Saga' com a minha esposa... Desta vez foi o Ataque dos Clones... Ao contrario do primeiro filme, nao aumentarei a cotacao dele... destaque para o Mestre Yoda em acao"
"Oct 22, 2009",3.5,"half good, half excellent"
"Oct 22, 2009",3,lets just say hayden can't act ewan is awesome at least jar jar has way lesser lines
"Oct 22, 2009",0.5,fuck you george lucas fuck you in your stupid ass
"Oct 22, 2009",3.5,"The movie can be slow at times, but it is a big improvement over the phantom menace."
"Oct 20, 2009",1,Nerd rape. And the worst kind.
"Oct 20, 2009",1.5,Not as good as the orginal three. Long and boring
"Oct 20, 2009",1.5,menso accion aqui si hay que pensarlo
"Oct 20, 2009",4,Outstanding Master Yoda is! ;-)
"Oct 19, 2009",2,not as good the the first 3
"Oct 19, 2009",1.5,or attack of the drones
"Oct 19, 2009",3,From most to least but still somewhat enjoyable
"Oct 18, 2009",3.5,great movie I love star wars should see this movies new star wars fans might like it and old star wars fans will love it to
"Oct 18, 2009",2.5,To romantic for my likings
"Oct 18, 2009",3,Better than Phantom Menace.
"Oct 18, 2009",4,Personally my least favorite of the Star Wars films but there was one thing in this Star Wars movie that was one of the coolest most awsome things ever! The ending battle of the Jedi on Genosis. I dont like all the bright colors in this Star Wars movie and the love story between Anakin and Padme is not very strong. Still it is an amazing film.
"Oct 18, 2009",0.5,What was with that Jar-Jar binx character?
"Oct 17, 2009",2.5,I wanted to like it. I really did
"Oct 16, 2009",1,"I only like the three made like 30 years ago, everytihing else kinda pissed me off, need we say Jar Jar??"
"Oct 16, 2009",4,"Not my favorite, actually. Still awesome though."
"Oct 16, 2009",2,"Please take my arm, rip it off and beat me to death with it.  Better than the 1st and the one that cameafter but Hayden is an unforgivable mistake.  Isn't it a shame that Lucas has spent the Naughties raping to death all his remaining movie franchise."
"Oct 15, 2009",5,luv this movie action and forbidden romance.
"Oct 15, 2009",4,"I definitely think that this is a step up from the first prequel, Attack of the Clones fixes most of the flaws that were in the first prequel.
Everythign is better, the acting, storyline, ending, action scenes, script, everything.  Especially the action scenes, those were awesome.
There is also a little more drama in this movie that we didn't see in the first one, and the romance really starts to evolve between Anakin and Padme. Lucas did an excellent job of merging the romantic, and at times dramatic love part of the film with the exciting, action scenes."
"Oct 14, 2009",5,"one of the best movies of all time, a classic, way better than the original series"
"Oct 14, 2009",0.5,"You can't polish a turd, nor apologize enough to make me like this vomit."
"Oct 14, 2009",2.5,"A bit overrated, but not bad!"
"Oct 14, 2009",2.5,"Personalmente, la más floja de todas las de la saga..."
"Oct 14, 2009",3,"It's just ""to much""."
"Oct 14, 2009",1.5,no more anakin and padme fluff! too much... will vomit all ingested popcorn. i think i slept through this one.
"Oct 13, 2009",3,Better than Phantom Menace. Has awesome action sequences but the love story between Anakin and Padme is a little under performed.
"Oct 13, 2009",4,"Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones is considered by many to be one of the weaker Star Wars movies, but I enjoyed it. It is everything a Star Wars film should be: action-packed, suspenseful, and exciting. It is a vast improvement over The Phantom Menace, which was the weakest Star Wars movie. That's what I think, anyway. Some people probably disagree with that statement. 

Overall, Attack of the Clones is an exciting and well thought out movie that kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time."
"Oct 12, 2009",3,Just not as good as any of the original Star Wars.  The acting and dialogue don't cut it.
"Oct 11, 2009",3.5,Not one of my favorites a bit slow.
"Oct 11, 2009",0.5,"As bad as the first, it's a total disgrace to the original films which, for there time were great and still are, but this, it's crap. The acting sucked, the graphics were less than pleasing. Just all round a terrible movie."
"Oct 11, 2009",3,after episode one death of a franchise
"Oct 10, 2009",2,"Honestly, I was angrier about this one than I was Phantom Menace.  A promising story concept destroyed by abysmal dialogue.  Lucas should just have ideas and hand them off to people who know what the hell they're doing."
"Oct 10, 2009",2,I fell asleep the first time I watched this. . . in the movie theatre. . . still don't know that I've seen it all the way through.
"Oct 10, 2009",2.5,"Oh dear heaven...George Lucas obviously tried to be tragic and romantic, but it didn't work. The whole thing is corny. There isn't enough exciting action to make up for it either...except for the last half hour, which is epic. Every Jedi vs. an army of droids, and the Count Dooku battle...those were awesome. The rest is seriously awful. But because of the last half hour, I guess I can't hate it."
"Oct 06, 2009",5,Cuenta sobre el romance proibido de Anakin Skywalker con Padme y como comienza la guerra de los clones
"Oct 05, 2009",2,The one and only movie during which I fell asleep in the cinema. True story.
"Oct 05, 2009",4,"yeah i know all you ""purists"" out there didnt like it... DEAL.. i liked it!"
"Oct 05, 2009",5,Anakin! wooo! lol and its Star Wars.. awesome already
"Oct 05, 2009",1.5,"Didn't believe the love story between anakin and padme. The dialog for them was horrendous. The action scenes didn't have any emotion to them. However, they were well done. But they still looked like a video game. Hayden is the second most annoying character only to Jar-Jar. He's just a whining teenager. I don't believe that Darth Vader would have behaved like this. I believe that a young Vader would have had a stronger more menacing presence at this stage of his life."
"Oct 04, 2009",4,"A much better improvement over Episode 1, this seemed to tie the story together more. Not only that, it was just much more fun to watch. You had the big battle at the end, and I just loved the fight scene involving Yoda. The acting wasn't all that bad, but it felt as if Hayden Christensen did not feel comfortable with the role at all. We get to see the origins of Boba Fett and see Anankin spiraling further down the dark side. Anakin attacking that village was also a good point in the story."
"Oct 04, 2009",2.5,"Some call it better then episode one but to me, far worse. You see, episode one actually was entertaining without the quarrel of romance. In this flick, a once adorable 10 yr old pod racer became a horny and arrogant 20 yr old padawan. How he came to love her and how no facial changes was made truly tells you what will happen. The romance was pure awkward and the lines seemed to impatient as each actor was waiting for each of their line to end. It almost becomes unbearable.

Hayden Christensen plays as the new Anikan. Who has never seen the princess in 10 years. The world is a little different now. He is a Jedi, mom is gone, and he is falling into forbidden love. Kind of like that Romeo &amp; Julliette contra. The story serves no other purpose but to show the growth of Anikan. How he becomes more mature and more independent. One thing I did like in the film. Many people criticized that Darth vader is being exposed as a sorry kid instead of a total badass but I feel this brief connection truly shows how human Vader is. And all villians need to be human at some point and not completely be Jason Vorhees.

Although Haydens performace was a hit and miss affair, the kid does have screen presence. And although a lot of stupid moments in the film like the seemingly unpleasant conversations between him and senator Padme and the mothers death right on schedule, this film still has the purpose of entertainment that the old star wars flick had. And thats action. Lots of action. Not to mention a super cool light sabre fight between Yoda and Count Dooku. Things never end with Star wars. 

My biggest problem with the film was how stupid its moments can be sometimes. The relationship between Padme and Anikan along with Anikans mothers death right on time when he saves her. How could that ever happen. Was her will power saying ""wait for Anikan then die?"". Honestly, I dont care to bother. As a small Star Wars fan, this sequel to a prequel is just not that good in comparison. Definantly not better then the orginal films. Its fancy but not entirely clever."
"Oct 04, 2009",2,Seeing this makes me want to slap George Lucas...and then hug him for making the good trilogy and Indiana Jones
"Oct 04, 2009",3,Not a Star Wars fan.
"Oct 04, 2009",2,Blah....boring and unnecessary.
"Oct 03, 2009",3,"Packed with great action and visuals, but like the rest of Lucas' prequel trilogy, it falls apart in terms of characterisation and performance. The story is engaging enough, and is filled with memorable sequences and the odd bit of humour - but the love story at the film's core fails to hit home at all, with the two leads having little in the way of chemistry or pathos. Still, this is an entertaining film, albeit a very flawed one."
"Oct 03, 2009",5,this is one excellent movie
"Oct 03, 2009",3.5,"In my opinion, not as good as episode one. Never the less it is a great film. Exciting, and is defiantly not boring! The plot is good but not nearly as good as 4, 5, and 6. 75%"
"Oct 02, 2009",2,"Overall this movie was scene by scene better than Phantom Menace, but it had almost no redeeming scenes, so it gets a 40% for being a whine-fest, then a bore-fest, then an action-fest with no rhyme or reason, then the coolest scene in the movie that set us up for the clone wars, which we only got in animated form (the original animated miniseries and the 10 other 2d animated ones, the 3d movie never existed, it never existed, D':)"
"Oct 02, 2009",2,"it is a crap movie, but star wars, so cant help but enjoy it a little"
"Oct 02, 2009",2,"I thought Lucas would improve from ""Phantom Menace"" but instead he takes a step backwards, including more of his bad dialog and less of it's great action set-pieces. Instead, we get a Senate scene that is sci-fi CSPAN. I found myself realling enjoying it at times, but of course, Lucas had to write the damn thing."
"Oct 01, 2009",3.5,"This is definitely not the best of movies, and not the best in the saga, either.  It is a good movie overall with good action and a good script, but it just captures that ""Wow.  I hate Anikan Skywalker now"" sort of thing."
"Oct 01, 2009",3.5,good music all the starwars have  good storylines...
"Oct 01, 2009",4,the best one of the newies.  i think this one has yoda fighting.
"Sep 30, 2009",1,the worst of the prequels. sad...
"Sep 30, 2009",4,"better than the third, not as good as the originals (4,5,6)"
"Sep 30, 2009",0.5,BLAAAHHHHH Give my the originals anytime
"Sep 30, 2009",2,"Star Wars: Episode II finds itself in the unfortunate position of the second film in a trilogy, a notoriously difficult position to fill. Attack of the Clones is not the first film in the franchise to tackle the challenge, but compared to The Empire Strikes Back it is found woefully inadequate. Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones repeatedly misfires with incredibly wooden acting, a script that probably sounded better on paper, and special effects that have not aged as well as the original trilogy's. It still has its moments and the creative spirit of the films remains as strong as ever, but isolated incidences of excellence cannot carry long periods of poorly delivered storytelling."
"Sep 29, 2009",3,"i find it to be the most enjoyable of the prequels, even though I know just about everyone disagrees with me."
"Sep 29, 2009",2.5,"Algo sosa, pero al fin de cuentas es Star Wars..."
"Sep 29, 2009",5,Every star wars is good and this one is no exception. As I have a generic soft spot for star wars the action is mind blowing and the story is truly epic. I can not fault this movie much except the love scenes.
"Sep 29, 2009",4,I fully appreciate this film.  It's dope.
"Sep 28, 2009",4.5,this film explains a little more about  the missing piecies in the original films. i think this film starts to show anikians frustarion with being a jedi and his devoping romance with padme. The highlight of this film has to be the arival of the clone troopers (which turn out to be the storm trooper later on) and Yodas kick ass lightsabre battle agiants count dookuo.4/5
"Sep 28, 2009",3,"Nice mullet, Obi-Wan. Oh, well. Jango Fett was kind of cool."
"Sep 28, 2009",4,"The Great Second Episode of the Sci-Fi Fantasy Saga with fantastic Special Effects, Great Battles and a good Story"
"Sep 28, 2009",2,"In some ways, Attack of the Clones betters the previous Phantom Menace, but in most ways it isn't as good. Attack of the Clones improves on the special effects and action scenes, but doesn't improve on the story. Despite all of the good qualities, the romantic scenes drag the film down, as they don't seem to belong in the Star Wars Saga."
"Sep 27, 2009",2.5,"I never thought I'd say this, but CLONES is the ""worst"" of the saga.  While it offers some impressive visuals, it also engages in some misguided fan-service (sure, seeing Yoda fight was cool the first time around, but I tend to think that took away some of the character's charm), and the so-called ""romance"" between Christensen and Portman is, quite simply, awful stuff.  McGregor, McDiarmid, and Lee come away relatively unscathed, though."
"Sep 26, 2009",0.5,One of the Worst films ever made.
"Sep 26, 2009",2.5,"If Episode I was a sports event then Episode II is the hangover after.

Ewan McGregor wasn't halfway as annoying as I expected him to be (I guess it's because of the beard), so that's a bonus. On the other hand, Hayden Christensen was worse than Harry in book 5, and twice as grotesque."
"Sep 25, 2009",0.5,At least minimal Jar-Jar
"Sep 24, 2009",4,"The more I watch it, the more it grows on me..."
"Sep 24, 2009",3,A bit on the slow side for me.  The ending was too quick too.
"Sep 24, 2009",3,its star wars! i can't hate it!
"Sep 24, 2009",2.5,And I love Star Wars!
"Sep 23, 2009",1.5,How can a movie with a massive Jedi battle and Jango Fett being decapitated suck?
"Sep 23, 2009",1,as much chemistry as pat kenny looking in a mirror.
"Sep 23, 2009",2,También le falto algo.
"Sep 23, 2009",5,Excellent special effects and action sequences.
"Sep 23, 2009",3.5,"With more suspense and a more complex plot, it's an improvement over The Phantom Menace.  The battle scenes are captivating and will not disappoint fans.  

Some of the dialogue between Anakin and Padme doesn't quite work.

The performances by Christopher Lee (Count Dooku) and Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) shine above the rest.

The music helps drive the emotion, suspense, and even the love story of the film."
"Sep 22, 2009",3,"Despite being a definate improvement on the previous film, episode 2 is a mixed bag. The first hour and thirty minutes once again showcases impressive visuals and some fun sequences but is serious dragged down by a very slow pace, an unnessarily confusing political subplot, a badly written romantic subplot and wooden performances from most of the cast due to the fact that they have become lost in a sea of blue screen.
However the last 30 or so minute is where things really kick off as we get to witness full on jedi action, yoda welding a lightsaber and an ending so perfect it is worthy to lick the original films boots. It is in this final act that lucas once again displays his sense of showmanship that was ever present in the original star wars"
"Sep 22, 2009",2,"Probably the weakest of the Prequel trilogy, drags horribly towards the end. Lucas simply didn;t have enough story to fill three films."
"Sep 21, 2009",2.5,"If it wasn't for Obi-Wan, this movie would be pretty worthless."
"Sep 19, 2009",1.5,Oh God! The worst of all the new Star Wars films!
"Sep 18, 2009",5,"Among SW, this this 4th Ranking."
"Sep 18, 2009",3.5,The old ones still the best.
"Sep 18, 2009",3.5,Additional 3 stars for being Star Wars! Brings the total to...
"Sep 17, 2009",2.5,"The love story is contrived, there's no memorable or entertaining dialogue. The only thing that makes up for that is the awesome battle at the end. Too bad it's followed by a disappointing lightsaber duel."
"Sep 17, 2009",2.5,i saw this once a week for 5 weeks at university
"Sep 16, 2009",5,Loved it with a passion
"Sep 16, 2009",2,"not as bad as the first episode, but still bad"
"Sep 15, 2009",0.5,2nd worst movie ever made.
"Sep 15, 2009",5,Natalie Portman &amp; Hayden Christensen
"Sep 15, 2009",4,episdoe 2 was definatly the worst of the 6 but still in my top ten movies thats kinda sad
"Sep 15, 2009",3.5,"This movie is not close to as bad as people make it out to be. It is no where near as good as the originals but it is not a horrible film by any means in my opinion. I think it is better then episode one (besides the amazing fight with Darth Maul) because it doesn't have all the childish crap like jar jar and farting space camels like episode one did.

Now I think Hayden Christensen is a stiff actor who brings the film down a ton. Had a stronger lead been put in his place I feel this could have been much much better."
"Sep 15, 2009",3.5,"Not bad, but not one of my favorite star wars movies. In this one, their is a lot of focus on  love, instead of action, but at the end it comes out all right."
"Sep 14, 2009",3,"ZzzzZZZZzzÂ²

Un peu moins chiant que le I (quoique), et natalie toujours aussi bonne au naturel &lt;3"
"Sep 13, 2009",2.5,"Minus Hayden Christensen's acting, it's not that bad"
"Sep 13, 2009",3.5,"Probably the weakest of the six films, but it still entertains. The romance feels a bit forced, but it's all worth it to see the huge battle between the Jedi and droids in the Geonosis arena."
"Sep 13, 2009",2,Possibly the worst of the series...
"Sep 12, 2009",1,Hayden Christensen stop being in movies.
"Sep 11, 2009",3,I have to give it credit cause it's Star Wars but Original Trilogy ftw
"Sep 11, 2009",4,Not the best starwars film ever made but it's alright
"Sep 10, 2009",3.5,"This was my favorite out of the seconds trilogy, but nothing compares to the originals."
"Sep 10, 2009",2.5,"completely forgettable movie. just like ""Empire Strikes Back"" *excluding all the Jabba stuff, oh yeah metal bikinis*"
"Sep 09, 2009",3,EPIC YODA ASS KICKING  gets all my stars
"Sep 09, 2009",3,"I liked the romance. I loved Padme/Amidala's costumes. I'm not a huge Star Wars fan. So sue me. The combination of costumes, Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, and Natalie Portman are enough for three stars from me on this one."
"Sep 08, 2009",4,"Another awesome Star Wars movie
Not much Jar Jar like ep. I (Thank God!!), but still had some flaws
Some of the dialogue was a little too stiff (""I can't breathe"", ""I'm in agony"")
But I'd say the last few mins were awesome
So many battles, so little time
But this will only b a taste of things to come"
"Sep 08, 2009",3,The decline of the Star Wars movies
"Sep 07, 2009",4,star wars! i cant believe i waited till 2009 to watch you!
"Sep 07, 2009",3,Not the best star wars.
"Sep 07, 2009",0.5,I can't tell which one of the new ones was the worst.
"Sep 07, 2009",3.5,"Sorry.  I had a hard time identifying the ""new"" characters.  Great F/X though."
"Sep 07, 2009",4,"Better than Episode I, but not as good as III, therefore it is II."
"Sep 05, 2009",4.5,compared to the star wars sequels and the last prequel..this one lacked in that extra edge whichl the above mentioned franchise flicks have....nonetheless..it was very entertaining..the initial chemistry between skywalker and padme is perfect...and the continuous struggle in skywalkers personality is very convincing..in a way...it is the launch pad of the best flick out of the three prequels !..
"Sep 05, 2009",3,Give me the old trilogy instead.
"Sep 05, 2009",3,Oh dear. Another otherwise good film destroyed by the main actor. *cough*Hayden  Christensen*cough*
"Sep 05, 2009",2.5,"More important as an episode of the saga than as a film itself. Nevertheless we can see here a memorable light sabre fight between Yoda and Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and also the beggining of the Clone War (with the Jedi fight on planet Geonosis including Windu - the great Samuel L. Jackson - showing his skills with a light sabre). And we hear the Imperial March for the first time!
But I must say that most of the film is not as good as it shoud be."
"Sep 05, 2009",2,The worst star wars film.
"Sep 04, 2009",3.5,Hayden Christensen nearly ruined the franchise
"Sep 04, 2009",3,"i haven't had a chance to watch the whole thing, goes to show how good it was"
"Sep 04, 2009",2,"Though sporting some impressive action scenes, Attack of the Clones is a giant step downward from The Phantom Menace, cursed with Hayden Christensen's insufferably, overacted performance, awkwardly terrible dialogue, and an unconvincing love story."
"Sep 03, 2009",3,should have been something special....just goes to show all the best movies were made WITHOUT cgi
"Sep 03, 2009",4,Not as bad as everyone made it out to be.
"Sep 03, 2009",1.5,all of the first 3 movies are shitfests
"Sep 03, 2009",4,"The weakest of the Star Wars saga, but not bad."
"Sep 03, 2009",3,Don't really remember it
"Sep 02, 2009",3,bad movie with cool parts
"Sep 02, 2009",1.5,Phantom menace sucks more! No Attack of the clones suck more!
"Sep 02, 2009",3,"the story is about a guy falling in love and having a romance that no one approves of, who is also under extreme duress because he massacred an entire village. not enough time is spent on exploring the main character's romance or at least romantic interactions. and certainly not enough time is given to the after effects of murder on either the main character's conscience or his lover's.

it could be improved with scenes that already exist. scenes deleted for extra blasts and zooms.

as a star wars fan i want to say more. as a critic who's opinion i want taken seriously i want to keep my fingers still and my mouth shut. :D"
"Sep 02, 2009",1,Worst Star Wars movie. Nuff said.
"Sep 02, 2009",3,"The Phantom Menace had Qui Gon and Darth Maul, Revenge Of The Sith had Darth Vader, but this one doesn't really have much going for it. Scenes with Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen are painful to watch. I'm going to point out that Han and Leia never rolled around in a field. Enough said."
"Sep 02, 2009",4.5,great but worst star wars
"Sep 02, 2009",3,"I really WANTED to like this one more than I did.  I mean, it was substantially better overall than Episode I, right?  It had a non-cutesy, angry Anakin, lots of time on Coruscant, more Jedi, a cool big battle between Jedi and droids... and most of all, there was more substance to the plot and the characters as well.  But again, it just did itself in.  Hell, even the cool lightsaber battles made me wonder why the fights in the original trilogy seem so comparatively lame.  Did they want to make the original movies seem worse?

I suppose I can forgive the weird and forced inclusion of R2D2 and C3PO, they're popular characters, give the audience what they want, yada yada.  But their main role in all the movies seems to be humor, and in this one their humor went from minor chuckles from personality quirks to just plain dumb jokes.  Bringing Padme back apparently unaged, accompanied by Jar-Jar who has somehow become a planetary representative, well, I can accept that because it plays to the story and the Jar-Jar part is brief.  The mysterious creation of a huge clone army, which apparently goes unquestioned by even the wise Jedi Masters is a little harder to ignore.  Dooku's character, while overall very good, just isn't given the depth and substance one would hope for in a prequel trilogy.  And why wasn't Dooku at least mentioned in Episode I?  Similar plot holes abound."
"Sep 02, 2009",2.5,Could have been so much better than it was.  Let down by some poor casting...
"Sep 02, 2009",2.5,"As I stated before, I hold ""Star Wars"" at a very high regard. But this one has to be the worst one of the bunch. Poor dialogue, poor acting (must not be able to help having to act in green rooms for months. No atmosphere to practice your craft in.), poor shot selection, poor cinematography (especially for the guys who are shooting the film.), ... I can go on but, the only things I can say that are good about this film are the 2 obvious. Thank you for limiting Jar Jar Binks' screen time and thank you once again for the nice special effects."
"Sep 01, 2009",3,Way back when I saw this film the first time I didnt really feel it at all but now upon watching it again I enjoyed it so much more. The galaxy is on the brink of civil war with Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) centrefold to it all. Anakin's descent towards the darkside really start here during which time he was charged with protecting Chancellor Padme. The film does have its fair share of problems but I found it fun and engaging rather than terrible
"Sep 01, 2009",0.5,"you can't give zero, but this deserves a zero"
"Sep 01, 2009",2,"Its bad, but at least Jar Jar has a much smaller role"
"Sep 01, 2009",3,"Awesome. Loved it.
Anakin's was irritating in the first half, so much that I frowned everytime he had a dissenting chat with Obi-Wan and made romantic advances towards Padame.
Yoda with the lightsaber was a treat to watch, wish it lasted little longer.

A misnomer but a fun and entertaining movie."
"Sep 01, 2009",3,Anything's better than sitting through that annoying little kid from the first movie.
"Sep 01, 2009",2.5,Get's and extra half star for finally seeing what Yoda can do in a fight.
"Sep 01, 2009",4,master yoda scene is class
"Sep 01, 2009",4,hv beeen hard core fan since 5 so hehehehe
"Aug 31, 2009",3.5,"I didn't know what to expect with attack of the clones. It was certainly packed with special effects, and more amazing visuals than Phantom Menace. But, with that said, was the storyline as impressive as the first film.

It was kind of like an all about Anakin movie, showing him as vulnerable, and not the person that you would think would end up turning into Darth Vader. But, I guess if you have to find a mother for luke and leia, you have to build a story around that. So, romance was inevitable. Only the death of someone he loved, showed him to be as violent as who he would eventually become.

More interesting was the way lucas introduced us to the clone army, and how this massive army was being created to eventually go to war against an enemy, but, you know that it was really being created to serve the future emporer. But, wether or not these clones ended up to be storm troopers is 
a question that was not answered. Only a guess.

Only a few bits of attack of the clones lead us more toward what would happen in the coming episodes. Plans for the Death Star, and Annakins robotic hand, which you really don't know about until Return of the Jedi. Oh, and you can't forget Boba Fett, now we know why he has so much hate.

One thing I really enjoyed, was the awesome presence of Yoda. Not only a jedi knight, but a fearless ass kicker!
But, I also thought there was too much going on. You would get interested in one thing and they would bounce to another.

But, I think it was better than revenge of the sith."
"Aug 31, 2009",4,"Anakin is all grown up and in love with Pad'me. I remember Hayden from another movie ""Life is a house."" So I knew who he was. Pad'me tries not to fall for Anakin, but it's their destny. Better than the first one."
"Aug 31, 2009",1,This is possibly some of the worst acting I have ever seen.  Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are so fucking awful here that they play a huge part in ruining this film.  Congratulations u guys! U SUCK!!!!
"Aug 31, 2009",3,"Romance was too cheesy for words, teenager Anakin is too drippy."
"Aug 30, 2009",3.5,"An improvement over Episode II. The acting will never be great in a Lucas movie, It sucked in the original trilogy too. I wish it was a little darker, showing the slaughter of the sand people."
"Aug 29, 2009",3,Should have been better.
"Aug 29, 2009",0.5,Better than the first but still shit...
"Aug 28, 2009",2.5,anakin is whinier than luke
"Aug 28, 2009",2.5,"About a month before tha actuall premiere. I was activelly following the news concering The Attack Of The Clones due to an advertisment I heard on the radio. Now that I have had an insight, of what the prequel trilogy was, I knew this film will not be anywhere near the greatness of the original movies. 

Episode II however turned out to be more disapointing than its predessesor, departing from the 'Star Wars' blueprint. Nothing in this film seems as engaging nor real. Let us break it apart and see if we can identify the flaws.

As usuall, I will begin with the story. The opening assasination attempt was exciting enough, but not as suprising, as Lucas intended it to be, this gives as the idea, that the film will run mainly on the political element, with endless senate and jedi council scenes, this is what actually happens, we get an awfull lot of endless, boring dialog, especially in the first portion of the film. 

First problems become apparent here. There is a time continouity problem here for one thing, Padme does not age at all, while Anakin becomes and adult and has an interest in her. Young Skywalker is played by the series biggest miscast: Hayden Christensen. He was propably cast to appeal to teenage female part of the audience. Christensen does not care for the role, not that his part was anything special. But his carlesness hit unbearable limits, as he sets his performance on auto-pilot and comes out as unconvincing. 

Our two jedi heroes this time are Obi-Wan Kenobi(McGreagor) and Skywalker mentioned eariler. Their task is to protect senator Amidala(Portman)and find the bounty hunters gunning for her. The second assasination attempt results in a reasonably exciting 'cloud car' chase. 

At least they took a break from the boring jedi council stuff. The chase itslef is a little overlong, however what follows is a nightclub scene  we can explore the city of Courscunt a little more. The assasin known as Zam Wesel is captured by the jedi, who try to question her, but she is murdered by her employer before revealing his name to them. The climax of the sequence was slightly predictable, but nessesary, if they wanted to run the whole story upon this element. The council then decides to asign Anakin to watch for the senator on Naboo, while Kenobi takes of to find the bounty hunter. 

There is a lot of galaxy trotting in this film, but mostly it does not take us to any interesting locations. First one is the remote planet of Kamino, supposebly not existing in the jedi archives. Here Kenobi confronts Jango Fett(Morrison) and discovers an army of clones ordered for the republic by master Sifo-Dyas. It is unknown, why exacly he wanted to create this army, so lets forget that plot-hole and move on. Soon, another action scene takes place, propably the most exciting sequence in the film. For the first time, we got to see the capabilities of the Mandalorian armour omitted in episode VI due to difficulties. The scene was well coordinated and timed just well enought. We soon get another space battle, which seems  promising enought. There seems to be a lack of balance between the political portion of the film and actions. They both come in batches at various points in the film, some beeing overlong or two short. 

We are sometimes taken to a different place as we try to figure out, what is happening with the main story. Lucas attempts to bulid up a romance, as he did in episode V. In this case, it only adds more flaws to the film. Both Portman and Christensen have little chemistry, utter the old lover cliches and their affair adds very little to the story, often distracting us. Some senate scenes are crambled into the movie, which show Palpatine slowly taking power step by step and the jedi council beeing concerned about the influence he has. If they had a sith on the plate, and they supposebly sence the presence of the dark side, why they weren't able to tell that Palpatine was Sidius? Jar Jar Binks commits yet another blunder by proposing to offer emergency powers to Palpatine, which resulted in muting the character in the next film(why is it always taking so long before people learn?)

But let us go back to the main point of interest. Anakin suddelny remembers, that at some point he had a mother, so he travels to Tatooine to visit her. He finds, that Watto sold her to moisture farmer, Lars, who married her. Skywalker sets of to find them. He then travles to the Tusken camp, where he finds her dying. This injects rage into the heart of the young padawan.  As this happens, Christensen gets the most opportunities to overstage and spoils this portion of the film. The Genosis portion is a little interesting but not flawless.

Meanawile, Kenobi is captured by Confederacy and Count Dooku played by Christopher Lee, who is the only actor to deliver a decent performence, not enought to save the film however. There is alot of the usuall ""come to the dark side"" stuff here, which we are all familiar with and expect from the saga. At least Lucas got this element right. Soon Anakin arives, along with 3PO, R2 and Padme to save his master, we get a droid factory sequence. 

The two droids work well as a comic relief in the film. The battle-protocol droid scene is a good chease moment in the film. However the separatist droids are not formidable foes we known them to be, they get exterminated easly. R2 again proves to be an important character by saving Padme from certain death. The heroes are captured... again. Next we see Padme, Obi-Wan and Anakin taking part in a gladiator like challenge agains some creatures. 

The film does not offer much new here. The rest of the jedi order comes to assist the characters along with the clones. The battle does not offer much excitiment, when the situation becomes hopeless, the cavalery arrives. Coroprative alliance leaders quickly flee to their hideout. While the battle gets a little more interesting we move on to a sward fight. Like any other sequence, this one is overlond and not exciting as anything else in this film. This duel feels too un-natural and staged, nearly forced to its last seconds and we do not see the demise of Dooku. It always bothered me that Yoda also fights Dooku, since it seemed out-of character for the Green Jedi Master. Wasn't Yoda supposed to represent peace and knowledge? 

This film feels truly anti-climatic, despite all the elements present: some ok villains, passible space battles, a final battle which comes of as decent and a formulaic story as usuall. It offers little pay-off similarly to its predesesor, not taking us any closer to the end. When we expect some plot elements to be over, they simply streach on to the next film. Some obvious changes are taking place, not without fans rolling their eyes dough. 

The performences are just a little worse than last time. Lee and McGregor are fine to an extend. Frank Oz has some ok lines as Yoda, but some feel a little unnessesary. McDarmid recieves a larger portion of the film, still with little oportunities to overstage but fewer Sidious moments. There is also the dark side of the acting present. Portman becomes less and less belivable here, Christensen seems stiff and careless. Samuel L. Jackson managed to annoy the producers to the point, at which they allowed his character to be involved in action, but his performance is still stiff and uninspired.

As for the special effects, The magic of the strange well known worlds is still there, however the effects seem more and more CGI based, which makes them look too fake.

As I left the theatre, I was wondering, did we really needed to know, how the empire was established, how Did Anakin become Vader etc. When I watched the original films, I have accepted all this without questioning the origin. 

In Conclusion, most of the flaws of the Phantom Menace prevailed in Attack Of the Clones. The story here lacks balance and has a little 'Star Wars' element to it, there is little character development. Some performences get worse, why others bearly retain their original status. This extensive amount of flaws places Episode II at the very bottom of the barrel.

The review of Star Wars Episode III ""Revange of the Sith"" coming soon."
"Aug 28, 2009",3.5,Again the character development is low and some of the dialogue is ruff but the action and special effects are once again very enjoyable
"Aug 28, 2009",1.5,gets an extra half star for NOT being Episode I
"Aug 27, 2009",2,"The second instalment to the ""Star Wars"" series chokes on its poor acting, dialouge, and storyline, but cool CGI action scenes and an imaginative enviroment saves the film from hitting bottom of the barrel."
"Aug 26, 2009",3,I think I have seen it.
"Aug 26, 2009",4,"Anakin is slipping right to the darkside in this episode. Haha and the romance between anakin and amidala shows us that lucas doesn't believe the word ''Different People, Different Worlds'' haha a movie o universalism ! I like the duel of Yoda and Count woow soon I ll buy a yoda figure i think ."
"Aug 26, 2009",2.5,The middle movie of what can arguable the trilogy that didn't need to be made. the most entertaining of the three.
"Aug 26, 2009",3,Did Lucas think the reason everyone loved the first three films was becuase of the hairstyles and clothing?
"Aug 26, 2009",1.5,what a disappointment...
"Aug 25, 2009",2,"Anakin comes off as such a whiner.  I wish the acting were better, but the script is more likely to blame"
"Aug 25, 2009",2.5,"As far as children's movies go, George Lucas's Attack of the Clones is pretty great. However, if you're an adult, it's mind-numbingly embarrassing. Opt for the Phantom Edit instead."
"Aug 25, 2009",2,Slight redemption for the Phantom Menace.
"Aug 24, 2009",2,"The acting in this is really just terrible.  It has other problems too, but the acting...*shudders*"
"Aug 24, 2009",3.5,"alot more mature and darker than the silly, kidsy Phantom Menace
Anakin is growing into the person we all expect
his inner torment combined with his Jedi duties and forbidden love make for great structure
however, this is the slowest moving Star Wars EVER!
the 3rd act is the best part cause it sets up very nicely the next chapter"
"Aug 23, 2009",3.5,"After the near disaster of The Phantom Menace, Lucas gets back on track (slightly) with Episode II. It's still far too much unnecessary computer generated junk, but at least the story is a little darker and the quota of memorable scenes a little higher. Jango Fett is great and the fight with Obi-Wan becomes instant classic Star Wars material. Loses points for some terrible dialogue and 3PO slapstick nonsense. Still, more good than bad here."
"Aug 23, 2009",3,"Meme critique que pour l'Episode I, c'est beaucoup trop long, et cette fois, si JAR JAR BINKS n'est la que pour sceller le sort de la Republique et si JAKE LLOYD n'est plus la, et PERNILLA AUGUST que pour 2 minutes, c'est HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN qui me fait tiquer avec son jeu d'acteurs plus que ridicule. Pendant 1 heure et demie, on reste sur notre faim avant 10 minutes magnifiques avec un SAM JACKSON en forme avant de re-tourner a vide jusqu'au combat de YODA (enfin en CGI ) et CHRISTOPHER LEE. Alors pourquoi je le prefere au I? Pour SAM JACKSON, EWAN MCGREGOR beaucoup mieux et parce que LUCAS nous permet de voir les hommes derriere C3-PO et JAR JAR ( et qu'il y a deux acteurs maoris mais ca c'est accesoire pour la plupart des personnes...)"
"Aug 22, 2009",4,A great movie for sci-fi fans and casual movie-goers
"Aug 22, 2009",1,"I hate sand. It's coarse, it's rough, it gets into everything...Not like here. Here everything is soft...and smooth..."
"Aug 22, 2009",3,"entertaining fight scenes, somewhat interesting plot.

bad screenplay and horrible character and acting for the part of Anakin."
"Aug 22, 2009",3.5,minus the wines from the lil pussy bitch good movie
"Aug 21, 2009",4.5,must use force watching this...
"Aug 20, 2009",3,"star wars=awesome.
star wars1-3=less awesome."
"Aug 20, 2009",1,"Yawn...
Yawn...
Yawn..."
"Aug 20, 2009",2.5,"Ah a love story for the ages, and one that no one wants to see ever again."
"Aug 20, 2009",2,no match for return of the jedi
"Aug 19, 2009",3.5,one of the better Star Wars movies
"Aug 19, 2009",3,"George Lucas apparently listened to the complaints of Episode I, reducing Jar Jar Binks' part to a minor character, and adding more story and drama into the film. It's like X2: X-Men United. The sequel tops the one before it because it finds its mistakes in the one before it and fixes it. Attack of the Clones is more enjoyable and closer to the feel of the original films."
"Aug 19, 2009",3,"This movie wasn't bad.  The dialogue sucked, but the Yoda fight scene saves it."
"Aug 19, 2009",4.5,"BETTER THAN"" THE PHANTOM MENACE"".NOTHING BEATS ""THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK""."
"Aug 18, 2009",2,Ewan McGregor tried so hard. :(
"Aug 18, 2009",2,"Simply not as good as the others. It's sad to say, but I felt no attachment to the characters except Obi-Wan. Anakin failed to impress me this time around."
"Aug 18, 2009",3,It seems like Attack of the Clones traded in the good aspects of Star Wars for a childish teen movie. It seems like Lucas was trying too hard to bounce back after the action-lacking Phantom Menace that he started lacking in plot in Attack of the Clones. It is still an alright film if you accept that it is simply not as good as the others.
"Aug 18, 2009",5,again love start wars
"Aug 17, 2009",2.5,Its like days of our lives with lightsabers. But there are still some parts that feel genuine Star Wars.
"Aug 17, 2009",3,"Yoda can move pretty fast, but not fast enough to make me forget about the love story. I think I'm gonna hurl."
"Aug 17, 2009",5,Doesn't matter how much Lucas fucked up these last three movies it still has a lot of sentimental value to me sooo fuck it
"Aug 17, 2009",4,another movie i couldnt watch...but i hear it was good so four stars
"Aug 17, 2009",3,Slightly better than SAND.
"Aug 17, 2009",3,"Ehh, Star Wars isn't really my cup o'tea and the only reason I liked it was because of Natalie Portman and Sam Jackson."
"Aug 17, 2009",3,A bit more interesting story than Episode I but still quite short of the mark.  Hayden's performance is pretty bad or perhaps the script is.
"Aug 16, 2009",2,Unimpressive...Anakin's so-called angst was painful to watch
"Aug 16, 2009",2.5,Great..but could have been much better....
"Aug 15, 2009",4.5,this was a great film never a dull moment. i love the affect that anakin has on padme just the romance was great and of course the usual star wars action great movie
"Aug 15, 2009",2,"Easily the worst Star Wars film of all time. Only has a couple memorable parts, like the fight with the robot on top of a raining roof."
"Aug 15, 2009",3.5,The guy who played anakin is the WORST actor in history
"Aug 15, 2009",1,"this movie was pure bullshit. not only did it not have a space battle, as every star wars movie should have ( the jango fett skirmish doesn't count), but it had too much unnecessary romance scenes, a LOTR rip off of a battle, and some of the worst dialogue in not only star wars, but in movie history. this movie sucks the big one."
"Aug 15, 2009",2.5,...in which Lucas started to get back to what made the original trilogy so good.
"Aug 15, 2009",4,Visual effects are amazing and the plot was very original
"Aug 14, 2009",5,"this was the best of the first 3, i didnt like the 3 much and HATED the 1st one.. but oh well..
anakin is sexy :) obi-wan v.v is awesome
the force be with you dudes!"
"Aug 12, 2009",3.5,worst star wars is still better then the best Matrix.
"Aug 12, 2009",4.5,"Now, this review is very biased being I am a ridiculously huge Star Wars fan, so that is why I am giving it such a high rating. This is most definitely the worst prequel in the bunch and Anakin is painful in this movie. The interactions between Padme and Anakin make me a little sick. Also I'm not the biggest fan of Count Dooku. However like all the Star Wars movies (clone wars aside) I love them."
"Aug 11, 2009",1,"Amazingly boring film featuring dreadful acting from all concerned, particularly the talentless Hayden Christenson"
"Aug 11, 2009",2.5,it was made for the money
"Aug 11, 2009",1.5,At least this is better than Episode I.
"Aug 11, 2009",3,"Alot of action in this film, but the main actor is bad in this film."
"Aug 11, 2009",3,This one is my favorite out of all of them
"Aug 11, 2009",2.5,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is definitely an improvement over Phantom Menace, as it involves a lot less politics, gives us more of the campy action that made the original films so fun to watch, and gave Jar Jar Binks a LOT less dialogue. However, it still doesn't quite reach the fresh mark in my eyes, as it also contains some of the major problems from Phantom Menace. The performances still don't give the characters any personality. These actors look nice, but fail to deliver believable emotion. And the addition of Hayden Christensen didn't help at all, as not only is Anakin just a whiny bastard in this film, but Christensen is terrible at delivering the necessary emotion. He tries, but as Yoda once said, ""Do or do not. There is no try."" On top of that, the plot, while more simplified and less political than Phantom Menace, is still pretty jumbled. If Count Dooku was leading a separatist movement, and only a Jedi could've erased files off of the archive, how come the Jedi never suspect him of being involved with the attempted murder of Padme? And also, isn't it a little farfetched that Obi-Wan just shows up at Kamino to find a bounty hunter, and yet he's expected to be there to examine a clone army? It might be better than the previous film, but it's still not on the same level of greatness as the older films. It just doesn't live up to the Star Wars name."
"Aug 11, 2009",2.5,"In this episode, Star Wars descends into heartless, emotionless, idiotic drivel, with weak performances and an even weaker script. The typical grand Star Wars production values are there, and see this film through when everything else fails."
"Aug 10, 2009",3,"Where shall we start? Okay, I am a fan of Star Wars (much like all people with half a brain stem) but this movie was just and I mean JUST above the phantom menace.

First, the positives. The overall plot I liked. The idea of Anakin slowly turning to romance, the clones, the separatists, war, etc. etc. I liked that. The action scenes were nice. The acting of the supporting cast was fantastic. And come on, Yoda attacking Dooku was just awesome.

However, I have one huge bone to pick with this movie. Whoever did the casting needs be shot of this planet with a very large cannon after apologizing 100 times to the population of the planet earth and the universe beyond. COULD HE HAVE CHOSEN AN EVEN MORE BLAND ACTOR THAN HAYDEN CHRISTIANSEN?!?!? I wouldn't have that big of a problem with this if he wasn't the MAIN STORY OF THE ENTIRE MOVIE! I mean god, the romance scenes were like watching two non-humans attempt to mimic human emotions AND FAIL MISERABLY. To her credit though, Natalie Portman got better. Hayden did not and if so only barely. I mean god...his voice, even after his mother died, STAYED MONOTONE!!! I mean your mom just died, show some emotion. 

Overall though, this movie was entertaining. It had some nice actions scenes, some good dialogue (from the supporting cast), a fantastic supporting cast and YODA FIGHTING. Thats just cool."
"Aug 10, 2009",0.5,"Just when we thought things could not get worse in the Star Wars universe, we have the casting of Hayden Christensen, surely the worst actor the world has seen since the third Lassie. in the role of Anakin Skywalker. Dire! If you haven't seen it,please don't bother. You'll spent the entire time dodging whizzy robots and hunting for the plot, or the exit."
"Aug 10, 2009",3.5,"While the movie is a massive improvment from the ""Menace"" movie, I enjoyed this movie, not becasue of the action, but becasue of it's prolouge enginuity. Christionson could have done much better, but he didn't, so the movie almost fell apart becasue of him. But again the movie prefails thanks to Lee, and Mcgregor. It could have been much, much worse. Good movie, and Star Wars is awesome anyway."
"Aug 10, 2009",1.5,Brought shame to the saga.
"Aug 10, 2009",3.5,Much better than the first one. More fighting scenes and is generally more exciting. We can see Ani's character changing throughout the movie.
"Aug 09, 2009",2.5,"George Lucas relied too heavily on cgi and eye-candy in this one. At times I felt like I was watching that stupid Clone Wars cartoon because of all the politics, and the more they got into that the less I cared about the film. 

It started out pretty good I liked the chase in the beginning and the discovery of the hidden planet and clones were pretty interesting, even though it was so easily discovered. The romance between Anakin and Padme was rather, not romantic at all and I wasn't convinced of a connection between them, it seemed more like two people constantly wtf'ing at each other. 

There are a few 'wtfs' in this one. At first they're like, 'we didn't know or approve of these clones!' then later they're like, 'yo we must use the clones already,' then later when chasing Count Dooku, Padme falls off the skiff then after being found she says, 'we need to get to that hangar!' How did she know where he was going!? Also Anakin for some reason just isn't a lovable character, and later in the film it seems he didn't mind his arm getting chopped off.

All in all, if you want to see tons of eye candy this is certainly a film to watch. It's really hard to dismiss this film considering all the visual magic and imagination put into this rather boring film."
"Aug 09, 2009",4.5,"Excellent.  Anakin may be slightly emo in this, but his reaction to the Tusken Raider movie is a scene-stealer."
"Aug 09, 2009",4,the clone war scenes are some of the craziest star wars battles ever
"Aug 09, 2009",1,The worst of the star wars series!
"Aug 08, 2009",2,"Ugh... damn it George Lucas. The good points, the Sandpeople slaughter, the music (as always John Williams is a freaking genius), the army of Jedi was cool at the time, and the same with Yoda fighting.... That was it. I have debated to myself which of the New Star Wars movies (Excluding Episode III) I think is better and I would have to say this over Episode I mainly because there is no Jar Jar Binks."
"Aug 08, 2009",2.5,"this film was ok, but i am not a star wars nut."
"Aug 07, 2009",1.5,hayden christiansons brooding face thruout the 3 make him look perpetually constipated.
"Aug 07, 2009",3.5,better than episode 1 but not by much
"Aug 07, 2009",3.5,the only movie of the trilogy that i like most...
"Aug 07, 2009",1.5,eh. some good fights. hayden christiansen almost killed the entire  series.
"Aug 07, 2009",3.5,"A good movie. It was a liitle hard to follow though, I had to watch it several times before getting it."
"Aug 07, 2009",5,great!!! story great keeps me on my toes.
"Aug 06, 2009",3,"Getting there... but still, wasn't great"
"Aug 06, 2009",1.5,"ugh... absolutely awful. I dont know how this can be called a star wars movie, or even a movie in general. its so awful and boring from start to finish. probably the biggest complaint i have is the use of cgi in every single scene. im not kidding, even a suitcase in one scene is computer generated! are they that freaking lazy that they have to make a suit case of cgi?! the only thing that makes this movie worth watching is christopher lee as count dooku. everything else is awful, especially george lucs trying to make us believe that anakin and padme are in love. let me demonstatre what his idea of believeable relationships are."" Anakin: I'm-so-in-love-with-you, padme. padme: me to anakin i love you anakin: obi wans not treating me fairly so im going to complain. padme: i love you to anakin.""  its as bland and ridiculous as it sounds. everything is bad. and for someone who is a HUGE fan of the original star wars movies and owns the three on dvd, a(just recently watched all three, finished return of the jedi) i was very dissapointed with this abomination. BLECK"
"Aug 06, 2009",3,"Very interesting since we find out a bit about the origins of the GAR, but suffers due to poor dialogues, particularly between PadmÃ© and Anakin."
"Aug 06, 2009",2.5,Kinda like the TOS movies...the even numbered episodes were better than the odd numbered ones.
"Aug 06, 2009",1.5,"What happens when you mix bad acting, with a bad storyline and was probably written in one weekend for a cash out trilogy? You get the new Star Wars films. This is the most boring star wars with seemingly nothing happening till about 20 minutes left of the movie."
"Aug 06, 2009",5,I like it despite what people say about the romance angle.
"Aug 06, 2009",2.5,"This is great on DVD because you can skip the ""love story"" scenes."
"Aug 05, 2009",0.5,Worst Star Wars ever!
"Aug 05, 2009",3,I was happier with the soundtrack off the movie but it is a Star Wars movie therefore I like it.
"Aug 05, 2009",5,its one of my fav stars wars movies
"Aug 05, 2009",3,"Way better than The Phantom Menace, and slightly more Star Wars-y with the Clone Troopers. Even better special effects."
"Aug 05, 2009",4.5,Any Star Wars movie is awesome!
"Aug 04, 2009",4,and the plot thickens! liked it too!
"Aug 04, 2009",4,"This movie receives some extra points in this review simply for depicting Yoda in combat.  It was amazing.  The story-line was decent enough, but not up to par with George Lucas' abilities as a writer.  I believe he could have done much better.  Hayden Christensen is also a very stiff actor and probably was a poor choice to play Anakin."
"Aug 03, 2009",2,"I wanted to like it...really...it's just that some parts are sooo cheesy.  Some parts I did love, but disappointing."
"Aug 03, 2009",3.5,"The acting is silly, but has a lot more action."
"Aug 03, 2009",2.5,Who the hell gave Hayden Christensen the part!? The romance between him and Natalie is awful.
"Aug 02, 2009",0.5,Somehow managed to be worse than Episode I. Shocked the hell out of me. Even Ewan McGregor could not salvage this movie.
"Aug 02, 2009",0.5,"STAR WARS IS OVER RATED! There, I said it."
"Jul 31, 2009",2.5,"A second episode a little slow, a little cheesy, Lucas isn't really great at creating emotions &amp; emotional moments, the over use of CGI is giving the film a very cold look, actors seem frozen &amp; the whole film even though entertaining, lacks undoubtedly some soul."
"Jul 31, 2009",4,"This was one of my favorite out of the Star Wars Episodes, it had more love in the flim and gave you more of an insight of Anakin and Padme 's relationship."
"Jul 31, 2009",3,mejor que el episodio uno pero.. todavia no tan buena
"Jul 31, 2009",3.5,"Getting warmer after the pathetic Phantom Menace, but still ruined by Hayden Christensen's wooden acting."
"Jul 30, 2009",4,"Not my fave of the saga, but I'm HardCORE Star Wars, and I'm a softy for romance. Portman looks gorgeous, but why... terrible chemistry. Here's my biased review:"
"Jul 30, 2009",4,A good film but not as good as the others
"Jul 30, 2009",3,"While I could easily tolerate little kid Anakin, I abhor teen Anakin.  He's whiny, thinks he knows it all, and...wait, he just sounds like a typical teenager, in any galaxy.  Overall, better than 1, but not by much."
"Jul 29, 2009",2,no improvement over the first this is still a mess with badly written dialogue and plot development. george lucas needed someone else to at least proof read this
"Jul 29, 2009",3,Okay.. so after episode 1 i had to see episode 2! And this one is also great. perhaps I should watch them all!
"Jul 29, 2009",3.5,"I think they were trying to justify so many things in this movie that made it implausible in many ways. Anakin started having doubts, but those doubts were not strong enough to defeat love, but that insecurity can take Skywalker to other journeys I expect to see in Episode III."
"Jul 28, 2009",3,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones: 5.7/10
Not the best in the franchise, but it's an improvement over The Phantom Menace, and dude, it's Star Wars!"
"Jul 28, 2009",3,This is the weak Star Wars film.
"Jul 28, 2009",0.5,Garbage that is hot and wet.
"Jul 28, 2009",4.5,if freaking obiwan dead earlier ...
"Jul 28, 2009",2,Arguably the worst of the Star Wars films. Good action scenes - but I squirm whenever I see (hear) Anakin &amp; Padme's love scene dialog.
"Jul 27, 2009",0.5,Lucas seems to think that LOUD is an acceptable substitution for story. The editing was a hack-job. Hayden Christiansen cannot act. The best part of the movie (aside from the closing credits) is Ewan McGragor's protrayl of Obi-Wan (still my favorite character in the series). Definitely doesn't have the heart and soul of The Empire Strikes Back; nor the sheer fun of the very first film. The original films never let the technology overtake the story. I felt this film (and the other 2) were all about the special effects.
"Jul 26, 2009",0.5,i hate starwars!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 26, 2009",1.5,Worst dialogue ever...
"Jul 26, 2009",5,U KIDDING ME RIGHT ????
"Jul 25, 2009",2,"After watching The Phantom Menace i couldnt wait to see the next chapter of the Star Wars saga. When the time arrived and I saw Attack of the Clones instead of being excited and ended up been so dissapointed.

The movie starts really good, the story as it was shown, was the one I was looking for, but after some time, this episode starts to lose its touch, it gets boring, althought its great the first time we see our heroes, Obi Wan and Anakin.

The CGI was mind blowing, but it's not enough to save the flick.
The acting improved from the first one, except for Christensen one of the worst portrays of a character, why choosing an actor with so little talent? Why wreck Darth Vader's legendary persona with an actor that can't even act?
He was terrible.

I dont know why George Lucas made this kind of chapter for the most enyojable and one of the best sagas ever made. But redemption for this trilogy came when Episode III was released...

Score:
2/10"
"Jul 25, 2009",3,hayden christensen just cant play anakin... other than that it was ok. i deffinately liked the old ones better =D
"Jul 25, 2009",4,"Not as exciting as the very first one, but still some gripping scenes."
"Jul 25, 2009",0.5,I FRIGGING HATE STAR WARS!!!
"Jul 24, 2009",3.5,"Love Star Wars, but when I say that I am talking about the original series."
"Jul 24, 2009",3,"La lÃ­nea de ""I kill them all, women... children... I kill them all"" podrÃ­a haber tenido mayor inflecciÃ³n de tono si la decÃ­a Stallone. Hayden... Hayden... Hay! den... PodrÃ­as haber optado por una boy band, no?"
"Jul 24, 2009",4,My favourite of the 'new' episodes.
"Jul 24, 2009",3,Natalie in some nice outfits but that's about it until Yoda lets loose
"Jul 24, 2009",3,"my least favorite of the star wars movies.  And I LOVE star wars.  i mean... yeah... it kiiiiinda works, but it could've been a million times better.  I mean it's the clone wars!  The stuff old ben told luke about on tatooine! I don't know, i always imagined cooler stuff."
"Jul 24, 2009",3.5,"Had never seen any of the Star Wars movies until May of 2008. Had a 6 movie marathon, and found the story to be great."
"Jul 23, 2009",2.5,"I am a big Star Wars fan, but I found this to be rather disappointing."
"Jul 23, 2009",5,STAR WARS OMFG I LOOOOOOVE &lt;3333
"Jul 23, 2009",4,i love all the star wars movies..
"Jul 23, 2009",4,"I love a good Sci Fi, very colurful characters or aliens"
"Jul 23, 2009",5,"Duh, star wars.'nough said."
"Jul 22, 2009",4,Very good. I liked this movie very much.
"Jul 20, 2009",0.5,worst star wars movie of them all
"Jul 20, 2009",3,"Not as good as the first three movies (or is it last three movies?), but c'mon! IT'S STAR WARS!!!!  IF YOU DON'T LIKE STAR WARS YOU'RE A COMMIE!!!"
"Jul 20, 2009",3,This is the weakest of the Star Wars films for me. Too much CGI!
"Jul 20, 2009",4,"Although the romance doesn't quite work, the final action sequences are stunning"
"Jul 20, 2009",1,The film was doomed when Anakim and Padme began frolicking a meadow.
"Jul 20, 2009",3.5,Not a bad star wars. It's deffently better than Episode I. It doesn't compare to the original trilogy at all. I think it's better than Empire Strikes Back though. Nah. It's worse.
"Jul 20, 2009",5,"This is as good of stories as the original movies, it is just better effects set before the death star!"
"Jul 19, 2009",5,We get to see Yoda in a lightsaber duel with Count Dooku. It was one of the funnies things I ever saw I was laughing so hard. I highly enjoyed this movie.
"Jul 19, 2009",3,the first part was better...liked natalie
"Jul 19, 2009",2,"It has less yar yar then 1 therefore it is better. Still George, stop making Disney movies, Disney already does that."
"Jul 19, 2009",3.5,"3 stars for being Star Wars
1/2 star for sucking."
"Jul 18, 2009",3,"After seeing the mess which was episode I I wasn't expecting much from this film. So, I was quite impressed. There's nothing like seeing a green midget kick the arse of Christopher Lee with a shiny stick.

The film is pure cheese and it really doesn't need to bash you over the head with 'look Ani is evil... Dark Vader's shadow... hate...' bla bla. We get it!

It was alright though... and it has a lot less Jar Jar in it (which can only be a good thing)."
"Jul 18, 2009",5,My favorite movie.  Need I say more ?
"Jul 18, 2009",5,I'm a sucker for Star Wars.
"Jul 17, 2009",4.5,"I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan, and this movie wasn't bad. The acting could've been better. There are parts that are a bit over the top, but it's still a great film."
"Jul 17, 2009",3.5,I applaud this one. I imagine this one was tough. It had to bride episode one with three.
"Jul 17, 2009",4,liked as much as the rest :D:D
"Jul 17, 2009",4.5,"The movie was very well done, though the acting wasnt very believeable"
"Jul 17, 2009",4,"This one I found to be different then the others (more modern version as it were), but still well worth the look if you don't mind it."
"Jul 17, 2009",4.5,"One of the main reason I love this film is Natalie Portman! I just love her! Brains and beauty! And I'm also a sucker in love stories and this installment is more of a Titanic-type story, forbidden love. Plus the action-sequence is great too."
"Jul 16, 2009",2.5,I like the older Star Wars better
"Jul 16, 2009",4,Great movie but am I the only one that thinks it's weird that Anakin grew up but Amidala still looks exactly the same.
"Jul 16, 2009",5,"Amazing but revenge of the sith is the best one but this should have been PG-13 lots
Of violence but it was really cool"
"Jul 15, 2009",2.5,"Ouch. Romance's not your forte George. And thanks for turning Yoda vs Dooku into Pinball vs Flapper... WE REALLY NEEDED THAT.

Obi Vs Jango was kinda awesome though. I still dig Nat. Gargh, tis' a hard one to rate."
"Jul 15, 2009",4,This movie was great! Not as great as the first one. But still great.
"Jul 15, 2009",2,cocky padawan learner...
"Jul 14, 2009",2.5,my least favorite of the series
"Jul 14, 2009",2,"episode I,II,&amp; III all sucked"
"Jul 14, 2009",4.5,"more jedi action, i mean more council jedis in action. 1st to see mace windu's violet light saber at the battle in genosis. it shows the origins of the clones, the super battle droids and some droidikas in action. the 1st CG animation of yoda, because on the phantom menace he was a robo puppet. i like it, 4 1/2 stars."
"Jul 13, 2009",1.5,"Gives me a headache just thinking about it. Hayden Chirstensen shows perfectly right here, that he can't act...."
"Jul 13, 2009",2,"""worst episode ever"""
"Jul 13, 2009",3.5,"I really liked it, but I am a Star Wars fan big time."
"Jul 13, 2009",1,worst star wars film
"Jul 13, 2009",3.5,"This was probably the best Star Wars movie, out of all six. But then again, i'm really more of a Star Trek fan."
"Jul 12, 2009",3,"The worst Star Wars. Excessive blue screen in every scene topped by horrible acting and worse writing, yet still worth watching for its last thirty minutes alone."
"Jul 12, 2009",3.5,too epic. haha. if there is such a thing.
"Jul 12, 2009",2.5,"Attack of the Clones can boast some of the worst acting from top-tier performers since cinema began. The effects are the movie's selling point, but as good as they are, they are also disruptively obvious. Yet, this movie is a massive 2-and-a-half hours of absolute excitement. There are action sequences here worth clapping at. There are romantic moments well worth a hearty belly-laugh.

Attack of the Clones may be unbearably bad, but if you go with your gut and laugh when the sequence calls for it, or cheer when the fight brings your heart-rate up, then you will do just fine. Don't take the movie as seriously as it wants to take itself and you may just find a candied delight at its core."
"Jul 12, 2009",3,"Casi no me convencio la pelicula en mi opinion la mas deplorable de la saga completa sin contar los horribles spinoffs con mala escenas y falta de coherencia, pero tengo que admitir tiene buenos efectos y un final decente"
"Jul 12, 2009",3,This one has great fighting scenes
"Jul 12, 2009",3,"Some scenes make you want to vomit your brains out, they're so bad. But Yoda fighting with Count Dooku is classic, and I also love Obi-Wan doing detective work on Kamino, one of the coolest places in the whole saga. In the end, very uneven, but watchable, and it has far more to offer than Episode I."
"Jul 12, 2009",2,Just not much of a star wars fan...
"Jul 11, 2009",3,"Good movie, but how can you honestly feel good about Anakin when you know who he becomes"
"Jul 11, 2009",1.5,The worst Star Wars movie out of the main 6...
"Jul 11, 2009",2.5,Loved it because of Hayden. other wise it kinda sucked
"Jul 11, 2009",3,Best of the new three
"Jul 11, 2009",2,To say that there was no chemistry between Natalie and Hayden is putting it mildly.  This pic descended into a melodramatic heap of goop and I found myself wishing he'd become vader soon because at least he'd stop whining and be an interesting character that perhaps I'd then actually feel sorry for!
"Jul 11, 2009",3,Perhaps my rating is inflated simply because it was so much better than Phantom Menace before it.
"Jul 11, 2009",3.5,"""Your clones are very impressive.  You must be very proud."""
"Jul 10, 2009",4,"There's one big problem with this movie, and it's the incredibly forced love story between Anakin and Padme. Don't get me wrong, I know it's important to the overall story, but I think it could have been executed better. Maybe just hint at it with some subtlety, and not try to over dramatize every scene focused on it. Without that subplot, this movie would have ranked much higher for me, better even than A New Hope. As for the rest of the movie, I love it. I think the scenes on Tatooine give a great foreshadowing to what happens in the next movie, and I think the whole Clone Wars set up is executed great. It would have been great to see more of the Clone Wars in the movies, but I think the show more than makes up for that. As always John Williams does a great job, and on top of that, the sound design is top notch. I had the rare opportunity to see this movie in a theater set up by Lucasfilm themselves, which had an amazing sound system. I think this movie was a great one to show off on that, and it still shines on my own home 7.1 system. I think it sounds quite a lot better than the Star Wars movies released before it.

75%"
"Jul 10, 2009",5,go old star wars!!!!!!!!!
"Jul 10, 2009",3,"I'm sorry but this was with out a doubt the worst of the Star Wars.  The romance scenes between Portman and Christensen were cheesy.  Now you can't play it all on the actors for this, the writing for the movie just flat out sucked!!  And it's sad because I'm talking about legend George Lucas, creator of the entire Star Wars universe, but he just can't seem to capture those romance scenes, which no offense didn't fit into the whole star wars thing.  I mean it was just flat out boring during those parts.  Alright, I give Mcgregor some credit in terms of trying to replicate Sire Alec Guinness, but this bales in comparison to his wonderful performance in Moulin Rouge (which shows he has a very capable singing voice).  The one thing I do give credit to this film is the special effects which were tremendous and it is unfortunate that Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers came out the same year, with better acting, better story, better effects better everything.  And unfortunately Attack of the Clones lost to Two Towers for special effects, but once again Two Towers had better effects.  But to end on a happy note, I've liked both Count Dooku and Darth Maul, I like my bad boys!!  The magic of the original Star Wars does not seem to have cared on to the prequel which is sad."
"Jul 09, 2009",2.5,Only good because of Yoda at the end.
"Jul 09, 2009",4,Uhhh my boyfriend is into these movies
"Jul 09, 2009",4,"whilst i enjoyed ""the phantom menace"" i thought it had many weaknesses when stood next to the origional trilogy but this edition managed to close the gap a fair bit with much less boring stretches and some good light sabre battles especially the yoda vs"
"Jul 09, 2009",2.5,"Great action sequence, but spoiled by the lovey dovey part...."
"Jul 09, 2009",1.5,too much politics... ugh!!
"Jul 09, 2009",4,One of the better one's of the newer ones.
"Jul 08, 2009",2,"Again, good visuals and a great story. Still, no charector development and too much dialouge. A mediocre entry."
"Jul 08, 2009",5,"I like the battle when the Jedis try to defeat alone the Droids, before the Clones appear... I love the laser battles! xD"
"Jul 08, 2009",3,"It is my personal opinion, but I believe that this is undoubtedly the worst Star Wars movie in the entire franchise. I believe that everything in this movie is completely watered down. The acting is way too corny, the fighting looks a little awkward, and the whole look of the movie is ehh. What was good about this movie, was obviouslly it's soundtrack which was fairly brilliant. Some of the scenes I were watching were so overly cliche. They didn't have to be that ridiculous, and I feel the acting of Hayden Christensen in this movie ruined many scenes. For some reason I feel that through the prequels of Star Wars, Natalie Portman gets better and better in acting. This movie, she's alright, and that's it. McGregor again is fine, and Samuel L Jackson, is how he always is. As far as the story goes, wow. I think that this could be the worst plot ever in a Star Wars movie. Really it takes on way too much. The film has so many things going on at once that it starts to get dull, and annoying. The romantic subplot in my opinion is terrible. The acting is too bad for it to be taken seriouslly, and I felt we could have done without a lot of it. As far as the lightsaber fight goes, it's the worst in the series. Everything looks weird until Yoda. It also feels rushed. Their isn't really much else to say about this movie. What Lucas did well was assert characters into places where it makes sense for the original series. Overall this movie is not very good. Could have been WAY better, and the worst movie in the series."
"Jul 07, 2009",4.5,Me fascina la Historia completa. Gracias Lucas ! !
"Jul 07, 2009",5,I love this series of movies
"Jul 07, 2009",4.5,"The end of a great love......
AWESOME."
"Jul 07, 2009",2,Not as good as other episodes
"Jul 06, 2009",4.5,This star wars episode plays like fantasy more than the previous films but it redeeming quality is that it keeps delivering on the Star Wars promise and treats us to more of a background on Yoda and the future Boba Fett!
"Jul 06, 2009",3.5,"Yeah, the love scenes were quite cliche, but the special effects were amazing!"
"Jul 06, 2009",5,star wars will always be a great movie and way better then star trek
"Jul 06, 2009",1.5,just when I thought I couldn't hate George Lucas anymore...
"Jul 06, 2009",5,Why must I rate Star Wars?  Really??? ... They all get 5 stars ... It's truly THE best series I've seen put together ... George Lucas is a genius
"Jul 06, 2009",3,"Definite improvement from the jarjarbinksy first episode. Still, it really doesn't rise up even to the episode IV, let alone The Empire Strikes Back, which'll remain the best episode of Star Wars by far."
"Jul 06, 2009",3.5,Kept falling asleep. But eventually go through it and it was O.K.
"Jul 05, 2009",5,develops the story of anakin's path down to the dark side. more of an emotional movie than the others. and it still has great action sequences.
"Jul 05, 2009",0.5,has the most skewed Cost/Quality ration in the history of film.
"Jul 05, 2009",4,"One of the better movies in the series. Except for the stupid dialogues between Anakin and PadmÃ© and some bad acting performance (mostly by those 2).
The battle in the end is great but the light sabres look awfully flat and inserted."
"Jul 05, 2009",3,Too much boring yakking and not enough action
"Jul 05, 2009",3,better than Phantom Menance but thats not much of compliment.
"Jul 04, 2009",3.5,Not as bad as people make it out to be.
"Jul 03, 2009",3.5,Much better then The Phantom Menace. It has a lot of fun action scenes with improved effects. It's closer to the standards of the original series but not quite there.
"Jul 03, 2009",2,"ATTACK OF THE CLONES?! Seriously, you can do better for a movie title. And you can do a better movie too."
"Jul 03, 2009",5,"EXELENTE, LA MEJOR HISTORIA DE AMOR EN LAS GALAXIAS"
"Jul 03, 2009",4.5,"Great. 5 min of romance i would have taken out, besides that, great."
"Jul 03, 2009",4,"Anakin gets with Natalie Portman.

Now there's the power of the force."
"Jul 02, 2009",3.5,"Wow, I cannot believe its been so long since this movie was released.  I rather enjoyed this movie.  It was significantly better than the Phantom Menace, and I assure you, if you are new to Star Wars, and you make it through the first prequel, they keep getting better!  

All around, a fairly solid action packed sci-fi adventure with a little something for everyone."
"Jul 01, 2009",2,"I hope Greg won't divorce me for this harsh rating

--I guess it's not a problem - we rated it the same!"
"Jul 01, 2009",1.5,"Ugh. Better than ""Phantom Menace"". But sort of like saying being stabbed with a potato peeler is better than a dagger."
"Jul 01, 2009",3,":((( ils auraient du faire le 7,8,9 à place"
"Jul 01, 2009",2,"To be honest I can't even remember what this one was about, but I'll give it two for what it could have been"
"Jul 01, 2009",3,"One step forward, and one step back. The plot has definitly improved from the previous film, but once again the overuse of CGI, the mediocre acting, and dragging sequences don't help. It's neither better, nor worse than Episode I. On a side note, Christopher Lee + Lightsaber = Badass."
"Jul 01, 2009",3,"Better than Episode I, but not great. These new Star Wars leaves me wanting and not really caring about the characters as we did the original trilogy characters."
"Jul 01, 2009",3.5,"This film suffers just as much as the 1999 prequel, although it improves on many levels, it also disappoints to a similar degree. Hayden Christensen's non-existent charisma gives him little to no stage presence which damages the action and pace. As a result the promise of an epic-love story fizzles into something of a cliched mess. Back is the enjoyable banter between our loveable robots, and the actions scenes towards the end help to save the movie. Frank Oz has never before added such life into his little green hero, but the film does not quite have a commander in the vein of Liam Neeson. Thankfully the next film restores the franchise to its prime in a final bow."
"Jul 01, 2009",3,"Quite possibly the weakest out the entire Star Wars franchise, but forgivable none the less."
"Jun 30, 2009",2,"Possibly the weakest of all the live-action Star Wars films, primarily because it seems more like an extended trailer for Episode III than an actual film."
"Jun 30, 2009",3,"Better than the first one, but still lacking compared to the original trilogy."
"Jun 30, 2009",5,my Favorite out of all of the star wars
"Jun 30, 2009",1,The acting and dialogue could have  been so much better. Sad.
"Jun 30, 2009",2.5,Que desilusão. Mas é melhor que o episódio 1
"Jun 29, 2009",4,i don't care what you say i found this film entertaining
"Jun 29, 2009",1.5,"Similar to my thoughts on ""The Phantom Menace"", but worse. Man, a block of wood would've been better than Hayden."
"Jun 28, 2009",2.5,"I watched this and I felt like I was watching a highschool play. Good story, bad script, bad acting."
"Jun 28, 2009",3,Still a bigger fan of the original three. And the first one. Then they went all obsessive stalker is sexy and lost me.
"Jun 28, 2009",4,"I liked this movie, but there are some things about the script that I felt were stupid. Like why did the Jedi just abandon Anakin's mother on Tatooine? They could have and should have returned for her after Episode I. All it took was money, right? If they had, then Anakin may not have taken the path to the dark side."
"Jun 28, 2009",1,"no no no, these are not good films!"
"Jun 28, 2009",0.5,"Should be retitled the
""Attack of the Moans"".If possible 
this worse then the first one."
"Jun 28, 2009",2.5,Georeg Lucas shouldnt direct. Boring as hell until the lasty half hour where it becomes vaguely intresting. Should really be watched with kids.
"Jun 27, 2009",3,"The love dialogue makes you want to get a working lightsaber, and slice your ears off.  Beautiful imagery."
"Jun 27, 2009",3,A let down but a little better then the phantom menace
"Jun 26, 2009",2,"Sigh.... I will soon have 100 senatorial nerds stab me with a thousand deathblows... but this movie sucked.  George Lucas failed us all!

TERRIBLE acting, overdose on CGI rendered it simply cartoonish, and the title made me feel like I was walking into a B-movie... and I certainly walked out with my feelings confirmed.

He redeemed himself with Revenge of the Sith."
"Jun 26, 2009",5,"Needless to say, Star Wars: Episode II is just as great as the others. Exciting action scenes, great special effects, witty dialogue, angst-filled romance. Despite some of the negative reviews it had and despite some of the negative thoughts I had about this film, I liked it for what it is: A fun film that did not dissapoint me."
"Jun 26, 2009",2.5,"I was glad to see Lucas go back to his story telling style.  For a tweener movie it kept things together pretty well.... Though, how could any of the jedi council not realize how far wrong Anikin already was?"
"Jun 26, 2009",4,"I like all Star Wars movies, but I always get confused if I try to remember what happend in what movie. ^^"

"Jun 25, 2009",3,"And here we have Samuel L. Jackson, looking bored the entire movie."
"Jun 25, 2009",1.5,"Hayden Christensen, you ruin everything!!!"
"Jun 24, 2009",3,This movie was very poor movie.  Not want I wanted to see as this movie.  Was very disappointed.
"Jun 24, 2009",2.5,"mmmmm...i prefer 4,5,6..."
"Jun 24, 2009",2,"I still think the plot makes no sense, despite being quite intelligent and having seen it at least twice. Apart from that, the usual Lucas nonsense - occasionally pleasing to look at, and with a good score, but otherwise witless and charmless."
"Jun 24, 2009",1.5,"Dumma dumma Hayden! &gt;&lt; ""My crappy acting is ruining saga."""
"Jun 24, 2009",3.5,didn't really stand out to me... loved the story that leads up to the classics
"Jun 24, 2009",2,"I am a huge Star Wars fan. I mean massive! But what the hell is Lucus thinking making this pile of crap?!?
Some very poor acting form huge movie stars that should be at the top of there game. Personaly i wouldnt hae paied Ewan or Samuel for there parts as they clearly wasnt bothered when filming this. Its so sad that Lucas is tearing me Star Wars dream apart by making these first 3 movies, he should have just left it at Return of the Jedi."
"Jun 23, 2009",1,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
"Jun 23, 2009",1,Here was where George Lucas was starting to join the Dark side.
"Jun 23, 2009",2.5,Worst of the Star Wars films. Poor compared to the other Star Wars
"Jun 23, 2009",4,Star Wars what else can I say
"Jun 23, 2009",3,"Character study ends up being pretty bland, and the green screen is used far too much."
"Jun 23, 2009",2.5,"This film got better about half way through. The first half was awkward ans full of bad acting. But Christopher Lee was ace! He sure has the charisma and a great booming voice to play the evil lord bad guys.
It's nice that director Lucas finally offers the fans a good, long light saber fight, between Lee and some of the good guys, it must've been impressive to see -and hear!- in a dark movie theater.  But the romance were stiff and lacked chemistry. Natalie Portman is an amazingly Beautiful actress and the costumes department had created her a wardrobe to die for, but really the romance could've been written a lot better. And please, the way senator Amidala then gives into her feelings and gets hitched the moment the threat to her life seems to be over? What about her duties? And what about Anakin's career as a Jedi? I mean come on, at least a teeny bit of info on how this came to be would've been nice.
All in all, better than part one but not anywhere close to the Original Trilogy.
And minus half a star for JarJar Binks."
"Jun 22, 2009",1.5,"I don't get why this is rated higher than The Phantom Menace. I despise this movie. This is the slowest movie (very boring), where the only good part comes at the end. This is my least favorite Star Wars movie, and one of my least favorites ever."
"Jun 22, 2009",3,very good. 3rd is the best
"Jun 22, 2009",3,"A big letdown for me, this scifi film wasn't even near as great as the classic films and was the worst of the new three episodes. Special effects blast which attempted to give a sense of maturity by being approximately half full of talk and 'endless negotiations' between different characters, while managing to create a new generation of toy industry. There are also too many characters to keep track of efficiently while trying to enjoy the film - and thats just it, enjoying a movie shouldn't be such an effort. I still think the fully computer generated green little Yoda is the best character in this film. Too much talk, but well done special effects. The film could easiily be a third shorter, just take away most of the negotiations and boring conversations which make no sense to me still. Perhaps I sound harsh, but this was supposed to be a classic scifi-movie experience. Natalie Portman, pretty - the movie, hollow slow-paced toyshow."
"Jun 22, 2009",3,"THe ""old"" movies were better, no question about that but...it's ok"
"Jun 21, 2009",2,Worst of the saga by far
"Jun 21, 2009",3.5,"Attack of the Clones is decent, Hayden Christensen couldn't have been a better actor in this one."
"Jun 21, 2009",4,The middle of the three movies in this series. It is the weakest of the three and serves to develop the characters.
"Jun 21, 2009",1.5,Again too many holes compared to the first three movies!
"Jun 21, 2009",3,The second lamest Star Wars film.
"Jun 21, 2009",3.5,"Hmm, Anni whines less in this one than in Episode I..."
"Jun 20, 2009",4.5,"STar wars franchise, nuff said! I'm a sci-fi buff all the way!"
"Jun 20, 2009",3,"Creation of a clone army?  sweet!!!  Love story between Padme and Annakin... beyond lame. :(  Between the acting and the writing, there was nothing believable about that relationship (not to mention the age differential) and even the introduction of Jango Fett couldn't save this film.  Better than Episode I but nowhere near Episodes 4-6"
"Jun 20, 2009",1.5,"Lucas has unfortunately demostrated in his latter years, the incredible ability to personally destroy and utterly trash his own creations (see the 4th Indie for late-Lucasville absurd ideas!). The initial trilogy: excellent (though I don't tend to consider the 3rd of that installment as anywhere near as good as the first two); the last trilogy of films in his myth-stealing series, bloody dire - though the Clones might have been more watchable had it not been for Christensen's and Portman's ATROCIOUSLY BAD ACTING! (mind you with a script that was ATROCIOUSLY WRITTEN!)"
"Jun 20, 2009",3.5,"It's a bit of a shame about this one because I see so much more potential than what was unleashed.  Had it not been for some painfully bad writing (Lucas should never be allowed to pen romantic dialogue ever again.  Seriously.) and some cheesy moments involving C3P0, this could have been one of the best of the series.  Watching Palpatine's plan go into fruition is really excellent, and Obi Wan's investigation on Kamino is a very effective scene.  But most of all, the arena battle on Geonosis is absolutely golden."
"Jun 19, 2009",4,too cheesy. a disappointment.
"Jun 19, 2009",2,Too much in too little time.
"Jun 18, 2009",5,COME ON ITS STAR WARS
"Jun 18, 2009",2.5,"Sure, this movie has the lightsabers and characters that I grew up loving, but was it too much to ask for something that hit the Star Wars fan base a little harder? This feels like a cold Star Wars movie that in no way warms your heart like watching the Millennium Falcon save Luke's X-Wing keister in Episode IV. I mean, I'm not asking for Daniel Dany-Lewis in There Will Be Blood (Do they have milkshakes on Naboo?) but everything here just feels robotic..."
"Jun 18, 2009",1,is it bad that i fell asleep?
"Jun 18, 2009",4,I think this is the best one of Star Wars
"Jun 18, 2009",2.5,Should have been more Mace Windu
"Jun 18, 2009",0.5,dull dull dull. just seemed to be about natalie portman's costume changes. how did she get so many clothes into that tiny bag anyway?
"Jun 17, 2009",3,A bit boring. Anakin thinking of .... only.
"Jun 17, 2009",3.5,"I love star wars, but this one could've been better."
"Jun 17, 2009",5,Geourge Lucas makes the best movies!! seen every one of em
"Jun 17, 2009",5,"hayden is somethin-somethin, isn't he?"
"Jun 16, 2009",3.5,Despite Hayden Christensen's inability to act- pretty good!
"Jun 16, 2009",3,A awsome film that has some great fight scenes.
"Jun 16, 2009",1,What was he thinking?
"Jun 16, 2009",4,This movie was good but not that very exciting
"Jun 16, 2009",3,"I'm finding that more and more people are regarding the new Star Wars trilogy as a disgrace, but I think it's really nice to have a complimentary set of movies to give backstory to the trilogy that I grew up with. I personally just love the plot, with its political focal point and subtle romance. It's just the catalyst to the entire series in my opinion."
"Jun 16, 2009",4,"&lt;b&gt;Synopsis:&lt;/b&gt; Anakin Skywalker shares a forbidden romance with Padmé Amidala while his teacher, Obi-Wan Kenobi, makes an investigation of a separatist assassination attempt on Padmé which leads to the discovery of a secret Republican clone army."
"Jun 16, 2009",2.5,George Lucas has either gone crazy or his brain is just chillaxing in his neck fat.
"Jun 15, 2009",3.5,"He may be good looking, but Hayden Christensen acting is horrible, probably the worst actor ever.  Beyond that, the movie is good"
"Jun 15, 2009",5,"&lt;b&gt;Plot:&lt;/b&gt; Anakin Skywalker shares a forbidden romance with Padmé Amidala while his teacher, Obi-Wan Kenobi, makes an investigation of a separatist assassination attempt on Padmé which leads to the discovery of a secret Republican clone army. 
&lt;b&gt;Starring:&lt;/b&gt; Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, Kenny Baker, Ian McDiarmid, Temuera Morrison, Anthony Daniels

One Word: AWESOME!
I still like Episode 1 better, but there was more action in this! I heard a lot of people criticize about the dialogue, but it wasn't &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; bad. I've heard worse dialogue in movies.
I simply &lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt; the cast. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are one of the most awesome people in the planet (I'm huge fans of them). Hayden Christensen didn't act so well in this, but at least he tried.

I'm probably one of the few people who liked both Episode 1 and 2 and I simply don't care what people think about the new 'Star Wars' movies!

MUST-SEE!!!"
"Jun 15, 2009",4,A good second episode.
"Jun 15, 2009",5,All of them are great.
"Jun 15, 2009",4,Best story and action
"Jun 14, 2009",2,"I think that this movie had the potential to be the best in the modern series, but Lucas blew it again."
"Jun 14, 2009",4.5,Who could not love star wars!!!  Great Movie.Every one shoud see it
"Jun 14, 2009",5,i like this movie because i love anakin and padme
"Jun 14, 2009",5,This is the first Stars Wars Movie I ever saw.  It is the movie that made me want to see the others and Love them!
"Jun 14, 2009",3,was pretty cool too. more questions answered
"Jun 14, 2009",3,Good attempt at downer #2. Best of the prequals.
"Jun 14, 2009",5,As always...STAR WARS RULES!
"Jun 14, 2009",4,"Improvement on the first of the ""new trilogy"" certainly told some important facts for the entire Star Wars story."
"Jun 14, 2009",3.5,"Hehehe, gotta love the prequel trilogy. Anything that enrages Star Wars fanatics to the point of entertainment is fine by me! :-p"
"Jun 13, 2009",3,"Better than the 1st, or 4th, which ever way you want to see it. I really enjoyed the love story part of it. The effects were good too but the sci-fi really is a  bit much for me."
"Jun 13, 2009",4,"lol, although this one was more love story than star wars-y...  it was pretty good.  lol."
"Jun 13, 2009",0.5,Hayden Christensen cannot act!!!!!!
"Jun 13, 2009",4.5,Vast improvement over Ep 1! I loved AOTC. Awesome LS fight scenes!
"Jun 13, 2009",2.5,Good for one time watch.
"Jun 13, 2009",3.5,I wish Lucas would have just made this the first movie...*sigh*
"Jun 12, 2009",2.5,Even worse than Episode 1!
"Jun 12, 2009",2.5,if you cut out about 45 minutes (and we all know which ones they are) then you'd really have something.
"Jun 12, 2009",3,well... well... nothing is romantic anyway.. and i think hayden is a bad choice ^^
"Jun 12, 2009",4,"Lightsabers will forever be my favorite weapon in movie history. 

Anakin: Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is essential to a Jedi's life. So you might say, that we are encouraged to love."
"Jun 11, 2009",1,This was embarassing. And I have sexual fantasies about living in the Star Wars universe on a daily basis
"Jun 11, 2009",3,The cast for Anakin Skywalker's acting is BAD!!! Prefer Leonardo DiCaprio to take the cast.
"Jun 11, 2009",4,"Star Wars Episode 2 attack of the clones is the second installment into George Lucas's star wars prequels. Episode 2 has a very strange tone that moves slowly but establishes the movie.I liked that Mace Windu had a much larger role in episode 2. Windu did not do very much in episode 1. In this you see why Mace is one of the strongest Jedi Masters around. Episode 2 also establishes Anakins love with Padme. Through the movie anakin betrays his jedi training by falling in love with Padme, Anakin also uses his emotions and anger.Through episode 2 you can see how anakin is beginning to fall to the Dark Side. I also loved the character of Jango Fett, I always loved Boba Fett in the original Star Wars so you can imagine how I felt about Jango.

Episode 2 had some great action scenes such as the fight between the droids and clones on Geonosis. I liked the design of Geonosis the planet made the battles between clones and droids much more energetic and fun to watch. The movie also had some pretty good lightsaber duels. The duel between Count Dooku and Ob-Wan/anakin was very cool, Though Dooku just whooped Anakin and Obi-Wan. 

It was also great to finally see Yoda fight in a Star Wars movie, When he fought Dooku it was phenomenal This scene truly shows why Yoda is the strongest Jedi. Yoda would have eventually killed Dooku if Dooku wouldn't have tried to crush Obi-wan and anakin, but Yoda decided to save the two jedi's instead of killing Dooku. Another Great scene is when All of the Jedi face off against the droids, Plo Koon also was in this scene. I pretty much love Plo Koon. There was a game for the playstation called star wars Jedi Power Battles, which was based off of Episode 1 both Plo Koon and Mace Windu were playable characters, I chose Plo Koon. It was strange because on that game he had an orange Lightsaber In episode 2 he has a blue lightsaber. 


I wish Count Dooku was in the star wars movies more. I loved Christopher Lee in The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy and I kind of Wish dooku was in the movie a little more to show just how sinister he really is. Dooku is a great Sith Lord who is very powerful yet he meets his demise very early in episode 3. Also you see early plans of the death star on this movie. 

Episode 2 is a step up from Episode 1 The phantom menace though it still is not better than the three original star wars movies."
"Jun 11, 2009",2,"An extremely weak film that tries hard to find a connection between it's two leads when there is clearly no chemistry to be found. The action is sub-par, with the only real ""woop"" moment being provided in the final thirty minutes. Overlong, and overdone; a huge disappointment."
"Jun 11, 2009",1.5,it gets a rating because it's still a star wars movie.
"Jun 10, 2009",1.5,"I can't even remember what happens.  Worse than the first new one, but not as bad as the last new one."
"Jun 10, 2009",1.5,Did not fine this movie as great.
"Jun 09, 2009",2.5,Worst of the prequels by far.
"Jun 09, 2009",4.5,"my least favorite star wars movie, but it is still a great movie."
"Jun 08, 2009",2.5,This is one movie that focused so much on the visual effects that it was negetively distracting to the movie.
"Jun 08, 2009",3.5,Imaginative with a bolder story and grander visuals but one half of the film is flawed due to a mixture of poor casting (Hayden Christensen) and awful writing.
"Jun 08, 2009",5,that is my favorite of all the Star Wars movies!  :)
"Jun 07, 2009",2,Slightly less bad than Episode I.
"Jun 07, 2009",4,Ugg Hayden couldnt act his way out of a wet paper bag
"Jun 07, 2009",3.5,Good movie...but too much of a chic flick
"Jun 07, 2009",5,i love anakin and amidala's tandem..
"Jun 06, 2009",3,"Better then episode 1, but still nothing special."
"Jun 06, 2009",2.5,FUCK HAYDEN CHRISTIANSEN!
"Jun 06, 2009",2.5,"""Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace"" opened a whole new chapter in the Star Wars saga  introducing us to a young  9 year old Anakin Skywalker   during a time of moral conflict in the Galactic Republic. ""Star War Episode II- Attack of the Clones"" is set ten years after the events in the previous films and while it is more stunning and visually attractive than ""The Phantom Menace"". But as a continuation of the great Star Wars Saga ""The Attack of the Clones"" falls short of the glory of the franchise and film making in general.  It runs like a  bad T.V. movie something that you would see on the Sci-Fi channel, it  is hollow and bloated  it  squanders  the limitless imagination and potential it shows in favor  of being an  extravagant,  special effects action set piece.    



George Lucas'  "" Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is like I said visually spectacular and is emotional   gripping but it lacks direction and   care, it lacks the labor of love Lucas put into the original trilogy and doesn't strive to push itself. It feels like Lucas didn't care to make it to please only to make money and tell Anakin Skywalker's story, which if it had a better script, more upbeat and emotional acting and a clear sense of direction this second installment of the prequel trilogy could have lived up to it's expectations, instead it falls flat on it's face and for 2hrs. 22min it doesn't get back up. It's not a terrible movie per say but it's not a good one either it sits in between mediocre and god awful leaning more towards mediocre. ""Attacks of the Clones"" is nowhere near good but what it is a visual action spectacle that has some amazing set pieces and action but nothing.



Ewan McGregor is good  but not good enough  to help lead the charge in this film  McGregor falls flat  in every scene that he is in  ""The Phantom Menace"" he held his own very well  but here  the material, the direction and the script are not strong enough to  help him boost his performances. Instead he comes out stale, bland and emotionless but still amazingly is not an eyesore. Hayden Christensen is not an actor I would call a favorite of mine, in fact I don't really like him at all.  He's bland, emotionless, and lifeless and devoid of power in his acting he doesn't convince you at all that he is the character he embodies. In fact he does just the opposite he completely strips you of all belief that his character (Anakin Skywalker) is someone deserving of great character status.  Christensen is   incapable of drawing any feelings from the audience but   I will say this in his favor   he does try and that, in some minuscule way, is something. Natalie Portman is not good nor bad nor terrible but just plain alright in this, Portman has done better work and this film is not one of them. Portman exudes a certain charm, style and sophistication that mange to make her believable under overwhelming circumstances and even then she doesn't convince but she never lets you down and that is something I recognize and appreciate, Portman is one of the highlights of this film and also one of the heavy hitters.  The rest of the cast including Christopher Lee, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Temuera Morrison, Kenny Baker, Ian Diarmid and Samuel L. Jackson   all deliver fine supporting performances in what can easily be called the weakest if the Star Wars series.



""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" is nowhere near the greatness of the first three original films or the first film in the prequel trilogy, it has it's high points but sadly there only visual and not emotional and moving the actors try there best with the material there given but they just can't seem to make it work. It lacks energy and delight it makes you feels patronized and kiddish. It can't lift itself beyond its legacy   it tries to follow and for that it sinks under the weight of one of the most powerful series ever invented (The original trilogy). ""Attack of the Clones"" is not a Sci-Fi classic or a classic of any kind it?s only purpose is to serve as great rainy day entertainment when you have nothing else to do. Beyond that it?s only all style and no substance."
"Jun 06, 2009",4,"Lots of action, and a good progression towards episode 3."
"Jun 06, 2009",4,Jaws theme song before the big BITE-Episode III. Need I say more.
"Jun 06, 2009",3.5,"Thought this dragged on a little at times, but overall a well done installment."
"Jun 05, 2009",3.5,"I cannot even say how awesome Natalie is. Whether she plays a queen of England or a senator of space, she is revolutionary. Star Wars is the bomb."
"Jun 05, 2009",4,"A marked improvement on its predecessor. The action and special effects are top-notch as usual, while the storytelling is a little more polished this time around. Watching Yoda have his first lightsaber duel was awesome and is one of the defining moments in the entire series for me. Once again, I also thought the cast was competent. Writing is more of the problem than acting."
"Jun 05, 2009",2,My favorite of this pitiful excuse for a good series...
"Jun 05, 2009",3,"eeeh... Man, I really want to like this movie. And its OK for what its worth. The story has its strong points (and plenty of weak ones), the action sequences are cool enough and most importantly, THERE IS VERY LITTLE OF JAR JAR and his annoying ass. I really dug the colosseum scene at the end. But still, it doesn't hold the magic and depth of the first set if Star Wars films. A sympathetic vote from a long time devoted fan I guess."
"Jun 05, 2009",3.5,"attack of the clones certainly had more action than the phantom menace but nothing really stuck out as a memorable scene, there was a lot of cheesy puns at the start as well which got on my nerves, but there was a lot of character development espically between anakin and padme' (whos name i keep forgetting, maybe i just don't care) the scene when anakins mam' dies was a bit too hollywood, i mean why would she die at the precise moment he rescues her! but it did show anakin has some darkside in him when he needlessly killed the sand people (poor little guys) cool to see sammy j jackson kick some booty

fav quote - 'go away jar-jar'"
"Jun 05, 2009",2.5,the firdt one is always better...
"Jun 05, 2009",3.5,Boring but a important to the poitical part of the story.
"Jun 04, 2009",2.5,"Continuing saga of the origin of Vader; not bad, could have done without Jar Jar."
"Jun 04, 2009",1,There is almost nothing redeeming about this film. It is literally painful to watch.
"Jun 03, 2009",5,ni laa perang galaksi yg BAAAIIIkkK punyA!
"Jun 03, 2009",3.5,"The love story was lacking, but the clone war plot was most intriguing.  Obi-wan's struggle with being a mentor was definitely one of the highlights to watch."
"Jun 03, 2009",1,Heres a boring movie.
"Jun 03, 2009",1.5,Sorry... But was so bored for me... even I fallen sleep on theather...
"Jun 02, 2009",3,"It's better than Episode I, and it's great how they explained the clones and the bounty hunter, but you could tell it had some work to do. There was way too much time spent between Anakin and Padme."
"Jun 02, 2009",3,ohk really but not the best
"Jun 02, 2009",3.5,Hayden Christensen ruined this movie
"Jun 02, 2009",3,"Honestly I have problems remembering details of this one.  It's okay to watch just to finish the series, but I could live without watching it as much as 1, 4, 5, 6."
"Jun 01, 2009",4,"Po ""Imperium..."" - moja ulubiona czesc."
"Jun 01, 2009",0.5,"Even worse than Episode 1.  Instead of seeing Anakin and Obi-Wan in action, we get Anakin rolling around with Padme.  At least Obi-Wan had an adventure."
"Jun 01, 2009",2.5,this gets an extra two stars for Kiwi Boba fett. seriously. I saw this in NZ. that scene was epic
"Jun 01, 2009",4,"Without doubt, this is the weakest film in the series.  It's far too talky and not nearly exciting enough.  Still, it has its redeeming qualities:  beautifully realized CGI-crafted characters and planets, the origin of Boba Fett, and that kick-ass Yoda lightsaber fight."
"May 31, 2009",3.5,"Easily the worst int he series, but you really can't deny the quality of the Star Wars Sextilogy."
"May 31, 2009",4,I really think this movie gets a bad rap. I think Christensen was superb. Brilliant film.

"May 28, 2009",3,"ok ok the anakin guy not so good, the sameul and ewan great, i wish liam neeson didnt die lol"
"May 28, 2009",4,"I have to say, I honestly hadn't seen Episode II since its release 10 years ago, but upon watching it on blu ray, I have to say, its good. It's again not going to be the crown jewel in the six film saga, but it definitely improves on Episode One and has its own unique style, plus Christopher Lee's in it, that alone was worth another watch to me. This time along with Episode III, the computer effects compliment the film instead of the film relying on them like in Episode I. I also like the character development since the last film, although the romance scenes are very cheesy. We get a sense of the darkness the prequels would go in this film, such as the anger brewing inside Anakin, which is a great aspect to the film. Padme is pretty much useless to me, she's not the strong badass female leader her future daughter would become and she's just there to have continuity. The flaws of the film consists again of one of the villians (Jango Fett this time...) being undervalued, which is a shame since he's important to the plot yet, they don't use him very much other than a few fight scenes. At least Count Dooku is much more fleshed out, plus he gets a great scene with Yoda. Mostly the only other flaw I have with Episode II is it does take a long time to get going even with a car chase scene at the beginning it takes its time to run fast. Overall, now that the film is coming out in 3D, I hope people will give it a second chance."
