10h ago,2.5,"Better than Attack of the Clones, not as good as the Phantom Menace. A rushed end to the prequel trilogy, putting everybody into their original trilogy start positions."
18h ago,5,"A masterpiece, this installment is very key, it shows us the rise of the dark lord of the sith, as emperor and especially of anakin, his tragedy to become darth vader, the dark theme makes this movie perfect, the best of star wars, on par with the empire strikes back."
3d ago,5,Revenge of the sith of is really good 10/10 AAA movie really good music and memes came out of it and the youngling mass murder is hidden. but that's the ONLY ISSUE i have with it. unlike the trash bag that is the ENTIRE sequel trilogy. the prequel trilogy is amazing the original trilogy is good now. Revenge of the sith is about general grievous getting killed or arrested and stopping the clone wars and then well anakin loses a lot of midiclorins obi wan got offered death sticks and then made the offerer go home and then contemplate life but that was In attack of the clones.
"Apr 18, 2021",3,A considerable improvement over the two previous instalments in the trilogy.
"Apr 18, 2021",5,I really love this movie mainly because of anakins turn to the dark side was great. All the fights where impactful and the music really complemented the fights.
"Apr 17, 2021",5,"My personal favorite Star Wars movie and a major contender for the best one of the whole saga. The cinematography, the action, the acting is all top notch and the lightsaber fights are straight up a gift to mankind. An incredibly tragic story full of emotion and excitement. Truly a masterpiece."
"Apr 15, 2021",5,"Best Star Wars movie hands down! Acting, CGI, lightsaber fights, the love was a lot less corny, the action, even though you knew Vadar was going to turn to the dark side they did an amazing job showing that and putting you on edge. The best Star Wars movie and movie in general of all time!"
"Apr 15, 2021",4.5,"The perfect finale for a flawed trilogy.
This movies give us what we asked for in the prequels, the rise of the empire, the turning of the Anakin and one the best lightsaber fights in the saga."
"Apr 14, 2021",5,es una gran pelicula donde esta el inicio de darth vader
"Apr 10, 2021",5,Call me crazy but I love the prequels. A great conclusion (beginning?)
"Apr 09, 2021",1.5,"Better than all the preceding Star Wars films combined so it's worthy of about a three out of ten. Generally unwatchable, especially the first hour of the film. I found myself constantly distracted throughout waiting for the incredibly boring and incessant light sabre battles to end. There was a bit of plot development but really another episode of dross. Can't see myself ever enduring another of these films but who knows."
"Apr 08, 2021",5,"The greatest instalment in the Star Wars franchise to date. Full to the brim with emotion and outstanding action, it is the perfect conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. There are only really 6 films in the main Star Wars Story after all."
"Apr 07, 2021",5,"The final fights and ending of this movie are a work of art.  Easily the best Prequel, and a THOUSAND times better than any of the sequels."
"Apr 07, 2021",4.5,"Still better than anything disney put out 
(Except MAYBE rogue one)"
"Apr 06, 2021",5,This is where the fun begins
"Apr 03, 2021",5,This was the best Star Wars prequel EVER!
"Apr 01, 2021",4,"My favorite Star Wars movie, even if it's not objectively the best one."
"Apr 01, 2021",5,This whole movie is just objectively amazing! The fight scene between Anakin and Obi Wan is just great and it makes me cry every time Obi Wan says Anakin was his brother and he loved him. :(
"Mar 29, 2021",5,Absolute masterpiece
"Mar 28, 2021",4.5,"3rd best Star Wars movie there is!

SPOILERS AHEAD BTW!!!!!!!!!!!!

Everyone thought that the sith would die and the Republic would win, but the Republic lost and became the Empire. Everyone expected that Anakin should be the chosen one. He became the very thing he swore to destroy. 

My opinion 9/10"
"Mar 28, 2021",5,"god himself came to me in a vision, and told me to spread the word that this is the single greatest masterpiece ever created, and nothing will ever be able to top it. many have tried to deny it, but this is the truth. 

- prophet jeremy"
"Mar 26, 2021",5,"The only reason the audience has put the score to a 66% is for the memes which is fair, this movie is far better than what you see from a rating standpoint. It's a conclusion to the franchise that keeps you wondering what's going to happen and dreading the outcome. This is Star Wars at its peak, the world building to the heart break of brothers end this saga the right way and the ultimate vision George Lucas always wanted."
"Mar 26, 2021",5,"Second to Empire. Great film, some of the best lightsaber fights in Star Wars. Last act of the movie perfectly goes into episode 4. Seeing what pushed Anakin into Vader and the fall of the Jedi order. Masterpiece!"
"Mar 26, 2021",4.5,"An amazing tragedy, a poignant ending to the prequel trilogy, and probably my personal favourite Star Wars movie to date. The only real issue here is Anakin's fall to the dark side feeling a bit too rushed and inorganic, especially after watching Star Wars:The Clone Wars (2008-2020)."
"Mar 23, 2021",4,Best of the trilogy and has a great plot this has easily the best fights in the prequal trilogy. It is surprisingly emotional and Hadden's acting was pretty good as well and plus the Padme and Anakin scenes are a bit more serious and much more better other then a few scenes they had good drama. I love how Anakin wasn't didn't turn to the Darkside straight away it showed how loyal he is . And the order 66 scene was amazingly done .
"Mar 23, 2021",4,One of the best movies in my favorite franchise 9/10
"Mar 22, 2021",3,21.03.2021 ---------
"Mar 22, 2021",4,"Great movie, some brilliant scenes and the good outweighs the cringe scenes in the film. Very memeable. Very fun. Better than all the sequels combined. Great film!"
"Mar 21, 2021",5,I love this movie. I grew up with it so there will be some bias but it's one of my favorites.
"Mar 20, 2021",5,How you like me now that you’ve seen the last 3 episodes? Well??? In comparison this is so much better. 
"Mar 20, 2021",5,Best Star Wars movie.
"Mar 19, 2021",5,"Without a doubt the most entertaining Star Wars film. Still has its problems like Hayden Christensen but it really stems down to George's directing. It didn't need a lot of improvement but still it did. The visual effects team really made do with what they had and actually improved the visual effects quite a bit. As to be the largest setup for the original Star Wars trilogy, this film had many powerful moments. Anakin and Obi Wan as a dynamic duo was really amazing and t Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen nailed their friendship. Ewan McGregor is a phenomenal actor and I can't think of a single role he had that was bad. This is his best performance and he nails his critical scenes with Hayden. There are 5 lightsaber duels in this movie. FIVE. All of them are very entertaining and very different from one another and all important in very different ways. Anakin and Obi Wan's exchanges in the 3rd act, are some of the best in star wars, and their lightsaber duel is still seen by many as the best ever, including me. Initial reviews of this movie said that the Anakin and Obi Wan duel was too drawn out- it's the last lightsaber duel George Lucas was going to give us and it was the most important there ever was. It was fast paced, epic, visually stunning, perfect uses of dialogue, amazing landscapes, and just simply very entertaining even watching for the thousandth time. Some people say this movie is overrated in 2021 because of how many memes there are of this movie. Ignore the memes you still have an amazing movie. This movie is one of if not the best of Star Wars. Absolutely fantastic joyride"
"Mar 19, 2021",5,Revenge Of The Sith is equipped with some of the best action of any star wars movie as well as a powerful story and incredible score.
"Mar 19, 2021",5,"An absolute Masterpiece of a film. Combined with the great plot aspects , thrilling characters and and unique twists with some of the best Star wars scores this movie takes the place for the best Star Wars movie of all time . And also leads perfectly into the original trilogy."
"Mar 19, 2021",5,The best Star Wars movie period! Everyone's performance was through the roof as well as Hayden Christensen who put on a show for the ages! It was fantastic to see the story unfold and how Anakin became Vader.
"Mar 17, 2021",5,Speaks for itself. Work of art!
"Mar 17, 2021",5,"In my opinion the best Star Wars movie, Revenge of the Sith has action, drama, and some moments that are truly tear-drawing. It makes up for the many flaws of the first two prequels, and gives a smooth transition into A New Hope. Character development like no other Star Wars Movie."
"Mar 15, 2021",5,"La mejor película de la trilogía precuela, su historia, su ritmo, sus personajes, etc. Una buena película para terminar una trilogía."
"Mar 14, 2021",4,"The only good movie from the prequel trilogy, Hayden Christensen was much improved in Revenge of the Sith.

Anakin turning to the dark side was done brilliantly.

Great visuals during the Anakin vs Obi-Wan fight."
"Mar 11, 2021",5,"This is the ultimate star wars movie. The score and the fight scenes are perfect. The CGI is a major upgrade from the first two. The story about betrayel and loss is perfect.
This is one of the best star wars movies."
"Mar 10, 2021",5,"The best star wars film in my personal opinion. It has every Love, Tragedy, Betrayal, and amazing fight scenes. From the turning of Anakin into Vadar to his fight with Obi-Wan on Mustafar. An amazing movie better than anything Kathleen Kennedy could do."
"Mar 03, 2021",3,"Its not really that bad. It might be my 4th favourite movie out of star wars only worse than the original trilogy. The music is amazing and the action scenes are stunning ( especially the lightsaber ones ) for a 2005 movie. My problems are that it's dialogue still bugs me. Its very likeable and every peace of aspect and the flaws are only small flaws compared to movies that are actually terrible. Altought if you watched original trilogy first you will see the story as a bit predictable. After watching The Clone Wars tv show, i'd say tthe ending feels more emotional. If you like Star Wras this is a very satisfying film"
"Mar 01, 2021",5,By far better than any of the sequels and a great movie. There are a few faults but the movie is very enjoyable!
"Mar 01, 2021",5,"Masterpiece, great movie, fits very well wiyh the old ones"
"Feb 26, 2021",4.5,This one was the better of the trio of the origin movies. I liked the plot and how the directors made the film and it was just good over all.
"Feb 26, 2021",3.5,"Even though the dialogue is clunky and the motives of Anakin Skywalker are unexplainable (what is he so angry about?), the basic story is good, Ewan McGregor is great, and the visuals are spectacular. Hayden Christensen was great in Shattered Glass."
"Feb 25, 2021",4,An improvement on it's predessessor. An interesting watch to see a fall from grace and connect the prequels with the originals. John Williams score also make the film worth the watch.
"Feb 23, 2021",5,Anakin was amazing this movie made the original trilogy look like dog water
"Feb 23, 2021",4.5,Revenge of the Sith somehow manages the feat of keeping viewers guessing about what happens next in a prequel film.
"Feb 21, 2021",5,This is how you do a Star War trilogy outside of the perfect original. The amazing conclusion to the Star Wars prequels!
"Feb 21, 2021",5,"It was just really enjoyable to watch, it's as simple as that. Also memes"
"Feb 20, 2021",5,"Its an amazing movie and one of my all time favorties, while not as good as empire strikes back, its still amazing. Why is revenge of the sith so great? Heres why. the plot is great, we get to see anakin and how he turned to the dark side. The way palpatine was convincing anakin to join the sith was greatly executed and made for a great scene. Hayden christensen and natalie portmans performance here really improve they do a great, serious, emotionally gripping job with what they are given. Its really emotional with what hapens when padme dies it just tugs at your heartstrings, we want her to be alive, but when she cant, its extremely emotionally gripping. This time there is no jar jar and the cgi looks great. The dialouge is much better than the other 2 previous ones, while the dialouge in phantom menace was hit and miss and attack of the clones was good, this one really felt star wars. And general grievous is a good villian. He has a cool design, character and fight with obi wan. The reason why anakin became darth vader is great. You see he has lost his children and wife the people he cares about most and wants to prevent this from ever happening again. A really amazing movie, not as good as empire strikes back, but still really really great. Revenge of the sith 100% A+"
"Feb 20, 2021",5,Anakin's descent into evil is so well done in a few hours it does everything game of thrones season 8 should have done but better.  Even better if you've seen the cline wars cartoon
"Feb 15, 2021",5,"One of the greatest movies ever made! Revenge of The Sith is packed with nonstop action, betrayal and one of the most shocking plot twists in modern cinematic history. Definitely a must see for any hardcore Star Wars fan. If you grew up in the early 2000's like I did you will obviously have a much higher opinion about the movie if you are an original fan or a Zoomer who only saw the Disney films."
"Feb 15, 2021",5,greatest star wars movie of all time
"Feb 12, 2021",5,best star wars movie ever
"Feb 10, 2021",4,"I think it was amazing, the only finger i can put is the cringe between Anakin and Padme's love..."
"Feb 09, 2021",3.5,"Look, it's hard to make a whole prequel trilogy about the villain origin story of the first Star Wars trilogy, so credit is deserved, but only where it is due. I still enjoyed the build up to this film very much."
"Feb 07, 2021",5,I love this film about the transformation from Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. This is also a meme gold mine for some reason.
"Feb 07, 2021",3.5,I imagine if this film was the only film to come out after the original trilogy this series would be a solid tetrology. This is what we've been waiting for.
"Feb 06, 2021",5,My favourite movie of all time. Brilliantly written and acted. A must watch if you haven't already.
"Feb 06, 2021",5,"Obi Wan alone accounts for 5 stars, would make it at least 66 stars but 5 seems to be the cap."
"Feb 06, 2021",5,"This is the best Star Wars movie, it has great lightsabers duels, great characters with great developments, good dialogue, great CGI and is a really conclusion for a trilogy. Every second in the plot crashes in the perfect climax of the movie that would only make you think ""Don't do it Anakin""."
"Feb 05, 2021",5,I like the prequels more than the sequels.
"Feb 05, 2021",5,It was good movie to captivate a great series before the sequel trilogy ruined the canon
"Feb 03, 2021",3.5,"Still not perfect, but 'Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith' is such a more enjoyable entry in the prequel trilogy - which ends strongly.

I had a fun time with this. I do have a couple of (relatively minor) complaints, but first the positives. I'd say this is the best that this cast produced during this run of films. Hayden Christensen is excellent in his role, it's the most I've liked him in 'Star Wars' for sure. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman give more than solid performances as well.

The special effects look nice throughout, while the score is pleasant. I also found the pacing to be practically ideal, which is a marked improvement on its predecessors. The humour and dialogue still isn't great, yet is also bettered. Crucially, the plot is very good.

With all that noted, I do have two things I didn't love. The first being the event that includes Samuel L. Jackson's character. I completely get the intention and reasoning of what occurs, but how it is shown did feel kinda forced and poorly written.

Another is the end, which overruns ever so slightly. I know it's setting up the original trilogy, but there are a few too many scenes; could've/should've ended on you know who's first breath.

However, all in all, I got a positive amount of entertainment and would class this as a step above the preceding two films. I'm glad about that, as it makes the prequel productions way more meaningful and memorable than they were looking to be based on the 1999 &amp; 2002 releases."
"Jan 30, 2021",3,najbardziej memiczny film świata
"Jan 30, 2021",4,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is actually a good movie. Unlike the previous entries in the Prequel Trilogy, Revenge of the Sith stands out for the right reasons. The acting improves tenfold in this movie, the plot is actually good, the dialogue, while lacking in some areas has improved by a lot, the CGI is amazing and the performances are much better. The best parts of this movie are easily the music, Ian McDairmid's performance as Palpatine, Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan and the final battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin is very fun to watch. Overall, while still flawed in some areas, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is easily the best entry in the Prequel Trilogy by far."
"Jan 30, 2021",5,"One of my favourite, the best of the trilogy and the best of the saga. You must see it"
"Jan 29, 2021",3.5,"Star wars Episode 3 is the last instalment of the prequel trilogy of the space saga created by George Lucas. It was the first PG 13 rated SW movie and for good reason. Despite all the controversial flaws of the previous films which are here too, in this one George finally creates a compelling gut wrenching story that if it wants because of the mediocre flaws it would be much better than it is. In this one Anakin finally falls to the dark side and becomes iconic movie villain Darth Vader. The script weaves together a great story that is part space opera and part Shakespearean tragedy. Hayden Christensen acting improves over the mediocre and weak performance of the previous installment. But in here bad dialogue, flawed acting, and plot holes continue to be a problem. Ewan McGregor shines once again as Obi Wan but is Ian MacDiarmid's portrayal of Palpatine  that takes the gold as he gives it all in as a manipulative mischievous villain who is the actual menace behind the star wars universe. The visual effects are beautiful and the drama is potent and George savagely descends us into a very dark and violent story that ends the prequel trilogy with a bang despite its flawed beginnings."
"Jan 29, 2021",5,"Episodes 1 and 2 had many flaws, but in total, it was good star wars, but revenge of the sith is different.It's not just good star wars, it's one of the most epic and tragic movies ever produced.The acting is very good, the script is excellent, and the last 20 minutes contain some of my favorite scenes in film.Anakin's turn to the dark side is portrayed incredibly, now, there is room for improvement, and that's what the clone wars series is for, but I liked his turn a lot in the movie to.Order 66 is straight up tragic, and the lightsaber duels are perfectly choreographed and very enjoyable.There are some mediocre moments or scenes, but I don't think those moments effect the movie as a whole.Finally, this is one of my favorite movies, a great star wars episode."
"Jan 28, 2021",4,"It has a dark, serous tone to it. Not sure Hayden pulled that off well. Ewan McGregor saves the day with his acting. Seems like too little, too late to save this underwhelming trilogy. Probably the 4th best of them all. "
"Jan 27, 2021",5,This film is a masterpiece! Its my favorite film of all time! It perfectly shows the fall of Anakin Skywalker! George Lucas is amazing!
"Jan 26, 2021",4.5,While this movie has some weird scenes it also has some of the most emotional an exciting ones in the skywalker saga! It's the fourth best star wars movie after the og trilogy
"Jan 23, 2021",5,"Revenge of the Sith is my favorite movie from prequel trilogy. It's action-packed and there is little exposition. The story keeps moving forward. It's very well paced and there are lots of great lightsaber duel scenes. This movie came out in 2005 and you can tell. The technology for CGI has advanced significantly since Episode I. CGI looks great.

I even got emotional at the end. I really felt bad when I saw Anakin and Obi Wan fighting to the death. They were friends and they had known each other for a long time. Padme also had a very sad ending.

All in all, I liked the prequels. I plan on watching them again some time in future."
"Jan 23, 2021",3.5,"Revenge of the Sith is the best movie in the prequels. Hayden Christensen was much better in this movie than in episode 2. The pacing moves along a lot quicker which is good considering the first 2 episodes dragged at a horrible rate. Some of the best action sequences in the trilogy and of course Ewan McGregor is great. However, the writing still brings some cringe-worthy dialogue and jokes that just miss. A decent way to wrap up this trilogy with a climax that just makes you wish Qui Gon Jinn had never died and instead raised Anakin as his padawan. Grade 80% (B-)"
"Jan 23, 2021",4,"Let me just say- this movie is a MAJOR improvement from the other two films. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the dialogue, and the writing in general. Let me be clear, it's a good movie. Not great, but good. It holds up. It's an emotionally heavy movie filled with action and thrills. But it still suffers from bad dialogue. Any scene between Anakin and Padme makes me cringe. But the major reason this film is the saving grace for the prequels is because when put together with the originals, all the films match together like a beautiful poem. Great movie, OK trilogy."
"Jan 21, 2021",3.5,"The only good prequel, I genuinely would recommend anyone to watch it.  The acting at times isn't great, but the story is poignant and interesting."
"Jan 21, 2021",4.5,Definitely the strongest of the prequel trilogy and my second favorite of all Star Wars films; only beat out by the empire strikes back. Anakin was totally believable in his descent into the dark side and his fall to Darth Vader.  Even though I think his motives were suspect ; I believed he fell and could feel his anger and hate. Obi Wan and his loss was very tangible. The most emotional of all the episodes. The light saber combat was excellent and the fall of the Jedi was sad.
"Jan 19, 2021",4.5,"A great movie with some bad acting, but the lightsaber battle in the end is one of the best lightsaber battles in Star Wars."
"Jan 19, 2021",5,"Very intense, tragic and emotional. seen it multiple times. Best Star Wars of all time."
"Jan 17, 2021",4,"Best out of all of prequels in my opinion. Quite good visual effects and great ending of prequel story. Story-of-anakin the movie.

A-"
"Jan 12, 2021",4,Definitely the best movie of the prequel trilogy. From the best opening space battle I have ever seen to an epic light-sabre duel near the climax this movie is bursting with Star Wars magic. This movie is a must watch for any Star Wars fan.
"Jan 12, 2021",2.5,Overrated movie with great ideias  but it has the worst effects in all of star wars and bad dialogue
"Jan 11, 2021",4,"Revenge of the Sith is just a great movie, great acting throughout and is a deeply moving story of tragedy that ends moving toward a new hope.

Lots of people jumped on the bag wagon with the prequels mot being perfect, but this is just a glorious film."
"Jan 06, 2021",4.5,"It is positioned as one of my favorite Star Wars film so far, and obviously the best one out of the second trilogy. (Episode I - III, 1999 - 2005) What do I think about it? It is more emotional than Episodes I and II, it is definitely and remarkably much darker than the rest and it has mind-blowing action sequences, a common factor in Star Wars movies. In my opinion, some of the best and most memorable moments in the whole Skywalker Saga are shown in this film. I mean, we have General Grievous, a great opening scene with Count Dooku, awesome looks for both Anakin and Obi-Wan, the tragic and chilling Order 66, a fight between the Jedi's master and the Sith's master, the birth of Anakin's children, the legendary fight between Kenobi and his former Padawan and, of course, the legendary scene where we witness the birth of Darth Vader. This movie sure has some things to improve, it is not perfect, but it is a fun, entertaining and wild ride for Star Wars fans. Star Wars' Episode III opened up the path that connected and lead to the original movies of this great and beloved saga that we all know and love."
"Jan 06, 2021",4.5,Not technically the best Star Wars movie. But definitely my favourite star wars movie
"Dec 30, 2020",3.5,"The last of the pre-quel trilogy is the best. It does a good job setting up a dark somber mood, The downfall of the Jedi is well brought out and the climatic battle between Obi Wan and Anakin are done well. Jar Jar Binks and Padme's roles are reduced which is not a bad thing given the poor dialogue Portman was given. The third one gets right what the first two struggled to deliver."
"Dec 30, 2020",4.5,A great Star Wars movie and the only good prequel ahaha
"Dec 28, 2020",4,"This was a great movie. Although a couple scenes are still corny and overdone, this was an epic and expansive defining chapter of the Star Wars franchise."
"Dec 28, 2020",5,"The best Star Wars movie to ever exist. Combination of Memes, Amazing choreography, and a good sprinkle of OG with the Darth Vader suit. You just have to watch it."
"Dec 28, 2020",5,You underestimate my power
"Dec 27, 2020",5,This movie is absolutely amazing!!!
"Dec 27, 2020",3,"Even though it's not as great as any of installments in the original trilogy, Revenge of the Sith is a massive improvement from the blandness or mediocrity of the previous two Star Wars films. While some characters like Anakin and Padme are still written poorly, others such as Palpatine and Obi-Wan are given much more to do and a lot more personality than before."
"Dec 27, 2020",5,"Best star wars movie hands down.

Hayden's performance was the highest point. His portrayal of conflicting emotions is second to none. His scene in padme ruminations is literally the best scene in star wars. Anakin is so badass when in the light and dark side version. We get to see his brotherly relationship with obi won in the beginning which was awesome. Hayden and Natalie's chemistry is amazing and they really make you much more invested in the movie. Ian McDiarmid's scenes with Hayden are so good they leave your heart racing. This is the most emotionally invested I have ever been for a star wars movie. Also, hayden and ewan chemistry is unreal, they basically give us a clone wars episode at the beginning of the movie and it is the greatest start to a star wars movie. The lightsaber battles are just perfection especially anakin v obi best lightsaber fight in the saga."
"Dec 26, 2020",5,A absolut great Movie i mean we all know that
"Dec 26, 2020",5,Not certain what side to be on the Kenobi and Anakin arc reach new heights and lead to where the original saga began. The Phantom Menace is a little nicer though a new Kenobi does shine in this film. Just an opinion.
"Dec 26, 2020",5,"Good, political, love story and a heart breaking story of a boy who grew up as a slave and becomes a slave to the emperor. Great ending and entrance to the original trilogy"
"Dec 25, 2020",4.5,"even though acting and lines in the trilogy is just ridiculously bad, the story itself is saves the film and also make this film my favorite one in Star Wars movie universe."
"Dec 24, 2020",5,The opening scene is the best sci-fi blast em up ever put on film. For that reason and much more I like this Star Wars the best
"Dec 23, 2020",5,One of my favourite in the Star Wars series! Anakins story is complete!
"Dec 22, 2020",3.5,I especially enjoyed the last 45 minutes of this and found it a surprisingly satisfying prequel finale.
"Dec 22, 2020",5,"It is one of my favorite star wars movies even more than episode 5 but although I left the political issue and felt more about the fights you have some points you find how
1. The performance of Hayden christense
2 the rush to show the birth of empire
3. Padme's death for no reason
The rest is a great movie"
"Dec 18, 2020",5,It's amazing and tragic story as well. Everything is perfect beginning with a screenplay and finishing with VFX. Lightsaber duel still the greatest till nowdays. Thanks to George Lucas and all team of Lucas Film and ILM and other.
"Dec 15, 2020",5,"Brillante, simplemente una obra maestra para los fans"
"Dec 13, 2020",5,I cry everytime when I see Anakin crying in the Jedi Council chamber.
"Dec 09, 2020",5,"One of the most brilliant and satisfying ending to a story ever written. The choreography in the fighting was the best you will ever see in Star Wars. The emotion during Obi-Wan and Anakin‘s last scene was intense, I still cry watching it today. The movie was entertaining to watch from beginning to end and there barely seems to be any dullness in the movie which is great because all movies need to dial it down in some parts to avoid over doing the great action. The music was intense too. In my opinion this was top three Star Wars movies ever made and the most rewatchable one."
"Dec 07, 2020",5,It was crazy. The answer to so many question. We had everything that we wanted. Anakin turning to the dark side was awesome.
"Dec 07, 2020",3.5,"O desfecho foi legal, mas algumas cenas são apenas para aumentar o tempo de filme, apesar disso o filme é bom, o melhor dentre os 3 dessa fase."
"Dec 07, 2020",4,"The best of the prequel trilogy, providing the closure we needed while giving us the great lightsaber battle of all-time"
"Dec 04, 2020",5,easily the best Star Wars movie to date
"Dec 03, 2020",3.5,"this film is by far the best in this trilogy, it is impressive and very brave, I like the atmosphere of tension that I have in it."
"Dec 02, 2020",5,Revenge of the Sith is my favorite Star Wars movie. It's way better than the sequels. The sequels are the worst.
"Dec 01, 2020",4.5,Love the movie. Top story but the dialogue is bad.
"Nov 30, 2020",4,"Whereas the other prequels seem only to touch the themes they claim to explore, Revenge of the Sith goes all in the dramatic weight a story like this could have. concluding these messy, boring films with e something that, while rough around the edges, is still a pretty good movie"
"Nov 29, 2020",4.5,The first 20 minutes are very good. The next hour isn't anything special and is really just exposition and conversations. The last hour and a half is the savior of this movie though and is probably some of the best Star Wars ever.
"Nov 28, 2020",4,"Definitely the best of the Prequel Trilogy. It does carry some of the wooden dialogue and crappy CGI from the previous two prequel movies, but overall this movie is vastly entertaining."
"Nov 27, 2020",5,just amazing faviorte film of all time
"Nov 25, 2020",3.5,Easily the best prequel but still not great. A exciting finale to the trilogy with solid acting and some of the best action in the franchise.  Could have used a longer run time as Anakin's turn is not convincing and feels rushed like the rest of the movie.
"Nov 23, 2020",5,It does an amazing job leading into the ot. It is also extremely emotional and entertaining.
"Nov 23, 2020",5,"yes , yes , yes , It finally happened in the best possible way"
"Nov 18, 2020",0.5,This is terrible. :(
"Nov 15, 2020",4.5,Amazing movie that I absolutely loved watching
"Nov 15, 2020",5,"Best Star Wars movie ever!!!!!!!
Everything about this movie (except the dialogue) is perfect. The character development, the lightsaber fights, the score everything is absolutely perfect in a way many films could not possibly hope to achieve."
"Nov 13, 2020",4,The absolute best of the prequels 
"Nov 12, 2020",3.5,"As I've said for Episodes I and II: the battle scenes are fantastic, the special effects are on point, and there are ELEMENTS of a really outstanding plot.

But with those beautiful things comes a mob of gremlins which take the form of unbelievably bad dialogue, buckets of cheese, and a soap opera between the galaxy's biggest mommy's-boy and a cougar senator who couldn't close her legs."
"Nov 10, 2020",5,"This Is The Greatest Movie Of All Time, I Cry Everytime I Watch It, Its A Story About Love, Betrayal, War, And Sacrifice, Everything A Movie Needs To Be Amazing.
Like, Just Watch The Freakin Trailer People!!!, It Still Makes Me CRY!!!!!
Their Is Nothing, I Mean NOTHING, I Would Change In This Movie, Even If It Would Turn Me In The A Jedi Master, This Movie Is EXCEPTIONAL!!!!!!!!!!
STAR WARS EPISODE THREE: REVENGE OF THE SITH
PLEASE WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Nov 06, 2020",5,has some of the best battle sequences in all of Star Wars
"Nov 06, 2020",5,I enjoy it! It is a pretty amazing movie! Upvote of approval!
"Nov 05, 2020",5,Hot take...Greatest Star Wars movie....ever.
"Oct 31, 2020",4,This movie is the first time the prequels really click. The slow and mundane buildup from the first two episodes boils into something much more fast paced and fun in this installment. This movie is indeed a must watch for all.
"Oct 26, 2020",5,A thrilling and heartbreaking end to the Star Wars saga.
"Oct 25, 2020",4,A good conclusion to the prequel trilogy
"Oct 24, 2020",4,"Finally! George Lucas pulled it off. There was some clunky dialogue, some plot holes but revenge of the Sith was still entertaining! And l was glad to see Hayden Christensen really step up his acting skills."
"Oct 21, 2020",5,"REVENGE OF THE SITH is a truly fantastic film. From the dark tone to the score, everything about Episode III fits perfectly."
"Oct 20, 2020",5,The best of the prequel trilogy. It was dark and sad and ominous. Ewan Macgregor is perfect as obi-wan. The lightsaber fights were great. The score was great. A must-see for sure.
"Oct 15, 2020",5,"Best Star Wars by far.  Tragic tail of how everything comes together, so emotional."
"Oct 14, 2020",4.5,"I love all the star wars movies; This movie is when Darth Vader is created in this movie the Sith starts to win. Most of the Jedi masters die, this explains the older movies in star wars like who is Darth Vader (No Spoilers!) how he became so evil. This is a good movie it has better graphics in it so there is more violence then in the others, I think if your a star wars fan this is a ""mustwach""."
"Oct 11, 2020",5,"This is the most emotional, the most powerful, and the most epic Star Wars movie. The first two prequel films (while I still believe they are severely underrated) were not at the level of the original trilogy in any department. But this movie gets near that level of quality, and even surpasses the originals in some respects."
"Oct 11, 2020",4.5,"Revenge of the Sith introduces the single most important and interesting plot element into our beloved Star Wars through Order 66 and is back to back with scenes that feel full and offer exciting duels and visuals. Although Anakin's turn is a bit rushed, I do not stand with the common argument that it is completely unnatural and that Anakin never would have turned to the dark side."
"Oct 10, 2020",3.5,"It's a heck of a lot better than the first two, though still not fantastic. The action scenes are exciting and beautiful, though the story is weak and Darth Vader's transition is awkward, unnatural, and nonsensical. Watching without critiquing brings much enjoyment, but it's hard to not harshly pick this prequel trilogy apart."
"Oct 09, 2020",4.5,"Disfruté totalmente el cambio de Anakin a Vader, uno de los momentos más disfrutables de mi vida del cine fue haberlo visto ya convertido. Algo que tuvo está trilogía de malo fue el exceso de cgi pero parece que ya que no se tomó esto en serio en las primeras así que siguió la misma tónica."
"Oct 07, 2020",3.5,"This is a good Star Wars Movie. Much better than Attack of the Clones. Christiansen is better here than in Clones, and credit to him. No major complaints."
"Oct 05, 2020",5,"My personal favorite Star Wars film in the franchise! Not only is the CGI better than the last two prequels this film is the last piece in the puzzle of the Star Wars franchise and not only sets up a new hope but concludes Anakin's story-line in the perfect way. This is also a film that makes you feel such a range of emotions that will make you feel shocked that a movie is capable of doing so. The battle of hero's is easily my favorite and most well choreographed lightsaber duel in the franchise. In fact, that sequence is so well choreographed that at times it almost feels to perfect to be able to happen like that. On top of that, the Order 66 sequence was done perfectly and one of the most emotional parts of the film. The only problem that I have with this film, that I guess I should also say applies to Eps. I&amp;II is the dialogue. Although This film does a much better job at it than the previous two it still has some rocky moments. (More on Hayden Christensen's part than anyone else's though). But that aside this film is the perfect concluding story-line to the Star Wars universe! (Until the abomination of the sequels). 9/10 Film!"
"Oct 04, 2020",5,"The best movie made, maybe ever."
"Sep 30, 2020",4.5,"9.5/10. this should be one of the best star Wars films. every time I watch it I love it more and more. this film is almost perfect with there being all the villains are awesome, contains epic duals including the final showdown."
"Sep 29, 2020",4.5,"It has been three years since the Clone Wars began. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker rescue Chancellor Palpatine from General Grievous, the commander of the droid armies, but Grievous escapes. Suspicions are raised within the Jedi Council concerning Chancellor Palpatine, with whom Anakin has formed a bond. Asked to spy on the chancellor, and full of bitterness toward the Jedi Council, Anakin embraces the Dark Side. 
	Star Wars is one of if not the most popular sci-fi trilogy in the world. It describes the battle between light and dark, good and evil. The Jedi Knights fight for honor and justice while the Sith fight for power and malice. Through the span of the trilogy, the main protagonist Anakin Skywalker, played by Hayden Christiansen, goes through many heart-retching situations. 		In Attack of The Clones (II), Anakin Skywalker learns his mother is kidnapped by a group called Tuskin Raiders on Tatooine. With rage beginning to consume him, Anakin Skywalker leaves his post from protecting Princess Amadala to track the kidnappers. By the time he reaches their camp, his mother is already on the brink of death. In her final moments, she says, ""I…I…love…."" She dies in his arms. Fully enraged, Anakin Skywalker slaughters everyone in the camp. In my favorite quote, ""I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I HATE THEM."" The Sith use grief and anger to fully commit to the dark side of the force. Some Jedi Masters like Mace Windu can tap into the dark side to gain the upper hand in battle, however, they have to be a very powerful force user to not allow the dark side to completely take over their being. Another situation Anakin was juggling with was his love for Senator Amadala.								 Years Back, in The Phantom Menace(I), Qui Gon Jin and his apprentice young Obi-wan Kenobi land on the desert planet of Tatooine looking for repair parts for their ship. Along with them is a young Princess Amadala. While on the search for the parts they need, they run across a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker. Off the bat, Qui Gon Jin scenes a great power within young Skywalker. Anakin meets Amadala and he is already in love. He asks if she is an angle because of how beautiful she is. Later in the later films, their love grows more and more, but their secret relationship is always tested. In lore, Jedi are not allowed to have feelings or relationships with anyone. As Yoda said ""The fear of loss is the path to the dark side. Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those who around you transform into the force. Mourn them do not miss them do not. Train yourself to let go and everything you fear to lose."" At the end of the film, Qui Gon dies at the hand of Darth Maul, and Obi-Wan becomes the master of Anakin Skywalker. 
	In Revenge of The Sith (III), the clone war is coming to an end. Chancellor Palpatine gains a foothold on Anakin Skywalker. He achieved this by using his feelings against him. The possible loss of his wife, the death of his mother. He used these feelings to hook onto him and draw out his anger. All Palpatine had to say was these words to gain Anakin's full attention. ""He could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side; he can even keep the ones he cared about from dying."" Once he heard this, Anakin was up for being taught this power. After this confrontation, Anakin is with Amadala and states this. ""I feel lost. Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me. Something is happening, I am not the Jedi I should be. I want more, and I know I shouldn't. I found a way to save you from my nightmares. I won't lose you; I promise you."" In the last 20 minutes of the film, Anakin fully embraces the dark side and fights his master Obi-Wan on the dark planet of Mustafaar. Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader, apprentice to Darth Sidious, and Order 66 is given. Order 66 is an order that forces the clone army of the Republic to turn and execute their Jedi generals. Anakin Skywalker pledged himself to the dark side by thinking Sidious can teach him how to save Padma Amadala. But this is just a trick to get him on his side. 
	All in all, I love the Star Wars trilogy. The lightsaber duels, the clone vs droid fight scenes, pretty much I can say that the Star Wars movies are my favorite movies. Although they have their flaws. In the movies after 1999, they are more politically based. Meaning there is more talking scenes or thinking scenes than fight scenes. Now in the older movies, like A New Hope or Return of The Jedi, those movies do not have a political party involved. My favorite performance was by Hayden Christiansen. He poured so much emotion into his scenes. When he killed the Separatist leaders on Mustafaar, he turned towards the camera with his dark glowing yellow eyes and a tear was streaming down his cheek. He truly made the audience feel what emotions Anakin Skywalker was feeling. Rotten Tomatoes gave Revenge of The Sith an 80% like rate. The audience score was 66%. Richard Corliss stated, ""A grave and vigorous popular entertainment, a picture that regains and sustains the film Force [Lucas] dreamed up a long time ago, in a movie industry that seems far, far away.
The critics were all around the same ballpark with the rating this film. Many said 6 stars or higher. I would rate this movie a 7/10 only because I am an action junky and I do not quite like politics in movies all that much. The Star Wars trilogy is still being watched by thousands of fans even if the movies are almost 20-30 years old. Any age can enjoy the amazing sci-fi experience."
"Sep 28, 2020",5,"Does it have flaws? Definitely but damn this movie is what I imagine a perfect Star Wars to be! This easily has the best action sequences in the franchise with Anakin vs Obi-Wan, Yoda vs Sidious, Obi-Wan vs Grevious and the opening battle being massive standouts. These action aequences are creative, different and filled with many tense moments and brillaintly designed ships and they make perfect use of the envrionment. Anakin and Obi-Wan's relationship is much better here than AOTC, they feel much more like brothers so it's heartbreaking when Anakin turns to the dark side. This movie also has the best score out of any Star Wars movie (which is saying a lot) with Battle of the Heroes being my favorite. Ian McDiramid as Palpatine once again steals the show brilliantly and his plan is so brilliant and so flawlessely executed that you can't help but admire it and it does a great job leading to the original trilogy and damn this movie tugs at the heartstrings, especially the ending and the CGI is mostly phenomenal. This movie has obvious flaws but I can look past them as this movie has everything I wanted in a Star Wars movie and hence, it's my favourite"
"Sep 23, 2020",5,I love this movie. Hands down the best of the prequels but def in the top 3 for all Star Wars movies. Lucas does such a wonderful job with action and story telling. I hope he takes over or at least has the majority input on any further Disney movies. He really is a incredible story teller. 
"Sep 15, 2020",5,"Amazing, it's hard to believe that this masterpiece came after its 2 predecessors."
"Sep 15, 2020",5,"The best Star Wars movie ever, by a long shot. The story is tight. The acting is beautiful. There are some moments that just shock you by how amazing they are. I literally have full size ROTS movie poster in my room. I'm not even joking. Seriously, you have to watch this. It is amazing."
"Sep 14, 2020",5,"It is a masterpiece !!
It shows us the impressive fall of the republic, the Jedi order, and the most shocking, the fall of Anakin, thus greatly uniting the prequels with the original trilogy.
This movie is just perfect in all its aspects, from acting to directing, I think it's the best cinematographic work in the entire Star Wars saga."
"Sep 10, 2020",3,"Being a vast improvement from its more or less abhorrent predecessors is great and all, but that in itself doesn't qualify it as an incredible film. Revenge of the Sith is a thrill ride that successfully sets up A New Hope as it should have, but accomplishing this task successfully doesn't particularly mean that the movie is a success."
"Sep 08, 2020",4.5,Scary and hilarious at the same time!
"Sep 01, 2020",4.5,"To this day I still love this movie. I would've loved to see the longer version with Han Solo and with the reveal that the Emperor is Anakin's dad, but I'll take the movie I got.  The lightsaber fights are incredible and Anakin's turn to the dark side is done so well. Great movie."
"Aug 31, 2020",3.5,Anakin I told you to keep your hands off Padme.
"Aug 30, 2020",5,Arguably the best star wars film. Never a dull moment.
"Aug 29, 2020",5,"What an amazing reflection of our current times. The division and killings.
It's a perfect film."
"Aug 27, 2020",5,Growing up with the prequels this is one of my all time favorite star wars films
"Aug 26, 2020",5,"The best one of the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy. This was a great sequel and is a big improvement over the first two ""Star Wars"" prequels."
"Aug 22, 2020",3.5,"a decent film with one of John Williams' best scores, but the writing can edge towards ""laughably bad"". the film though is one of the better star wars flicks."
"Aug 19, 2020",5,It's over other movies..... Revenge of the Sith has the high ground!
"Aug 17, 2020",4.5,Against all odds manages to close the trilogy with satisfaction.
"Aug 15, 2020",5,BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.
"Aug 15, 2020",5,its the best star wars movie I've ever seen
"Aug 11, 2020",2.5,"Yes it is an improvement. Yes it has some pretty good parts in it. Yes it is the best movie out of all of the prequels. But just because it's an improvement DOES NOT MEAN IT'S A ""GOOD"" LET ALONE ""GREAT"" STAR WARS MOVIE. People seem to think that just because something is improved it means that it's a great and amazing movie. But that's not always the case. An example of an improvement that it actually GOOD is Bumblebee. Bumblebee is a cute and fun movie where the plot is simple and it doesn't feel like an overwhelming around the world adventure like the other Transformers movies do and that's what makes Bumblebee such a solid improvement. But in my eyes, Revenge of the Sith makes all the same mistakes that the other prequels made and still has the cringey writing and acting. The opening action sequence was great except for the Count Dooku part (because the movie expects you to care for Count Dooku's death as if it's Anakin's start to the dark side, as if he didn't murder an entire village on Tatooine in Episode II), but then the movie goes right back to being boring afterward. And then the movie suddenly splits up the main characters. We finally got to see them in action together and we have fun while watching it but then split up for really no reason. The General Grievous fight was alright (I didn't think it was anything cool because you can't see anything while they are fighting), but it just went on for too long after. And when you think about it, General Grievous wasn't really needed in this movie at all. All he did was separate Anakin and Obi-Wan and then was killed by Obi-Wan. Count Dooku could have been kept alive and added more to the story than just being a mustache twirling villain in Attack of the Clones and for a couple of minutes in Revenge of the Sith. But nope we just get more villains that aren't big threats because more merchandise equals more money. Another thing that wasn't really needed in the movie was the whole Chewbacca planet battle. If you think about it, that entire side-plot served literally no purpose other than to provide some fan-service. The other problem I have with this movie is Anakin's whole turning to the dark side scenes. Overall, it felt underwhelming and extremely predictable, not only because people already knew that he was going to turn to the dark side because his name is Anakin Skywalker, but because we've already seen him to evil crap in Episode II. And now that he has another reason to turn to the dark side we already know exactly what's going to happen. The movie doesn't try to shift your expectations or lead to one way and then suddenly change and take you by surprise. It's too predictable. My last problem with this movie is the final fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin. To sum it up as simply as possible... it's way too long. I thought that lightsaber fights are meant to be short and sweet and really exciting. But with this one it just drags on forever and worst of all, you don't feel anything while they are battling because throughout these movies, they haven't developed any personalities at all. I only saw bland and dry characters having a super long light saber duel to finally end the movie. However, despite all of these things that I didn't like in the movie, there was one thing that I thought they nailed. It was that one scene with Anakin and Padme doing nothing and yet still doing so much. Without any words, you could tell by their faces that Padme is concerned and worried for Anakin and the future of the Republic, and that Anakin is hesitating and deciding whether to turn to the dark side to save Padme. It's subtle, the music was on point, and I think that I finally felt something (other than boredom) for once while watching these movies. However, that one scene can't forgive this entire movie's mistakes, let alone all of the other prequel movies. In conclusion, this movie is an improvement, but not enough of an improvement to make it a ""good"" or ""great"" movie. Also it's overrated."
"Aug 06, 2020",3.5,"RoTS is probably the best of the prequels.  Yeah, some of the acting is bad, but Hayden is trying here, and he has his greasy unkept hair that says 'I am a bad dude'.  The scenes with Padme are not quite as torturous as episode 2.  It is maybe a little overly long, but that is because it is essentially 2 films.  The first film, Anakin is trying to be good but he is a bit of a whiney bitch.  But then, almost exactly 1/2 way in to this, the switch flips and he goes full on Dark Side and just light sabers anything and everything.  It isn't even subtle.  The first half has all the trappings of the prequels - Trade Federation, droids, Jedi masters poncing about yammering about politics, lots of washed out colors and daylight.   The second half goes dark - aside from the tone - there are lots of night scenes, there are more things you might recognize from the Original films like the blockade runner, and Anakin is now just plain evil.  The last half is truly what Star Wars fans want to see - how things end up the way Episode 4 starts out.  Scene after scene lays out what we are expecting to happen.  We even get to see the helmet!  Of course, ultimately you know what will happen - in a way it is like watching a movie like 'Titanic'.
All that said - there are some major logic holes in this film, and the prequels more broadly.  Some spoilers ahead - why did Obi Wan not finish off Vadar?  Easy, stick light saber in head, you know, just to be sure.  So Obi Wan failed to finish off Vadar, he failed to finish off Darth Maul (as we find out in future films), he TRAINED Vadar, he let Vadar kill him, he lied to Luke - are we SURE he isn't working for the Dark Side?  Why are Jedi always falling off high ledges?  If they can move things with their mind, can they not levitate?  It goes on, but you get the idea..."
"Aug 05, 2020",5,"George Lucas' ""Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith"" had high standards after the first two movies in what is known as the prequel trilogy which had let down fans everywhere. They also had the difficult challenge to make it surprising when fans already know what's going to happen thanks to the original trilogy. They accomplished this by not focusing on the main storylines as much, and instead trying to show what was going on inside the main character Annakin Skywalker's head and the pain and fear he was going through that led to the choices he made throughout the movie.
	Throughout the trilogy, Annakin has been separated from his mother, lost his first mentor, and held his mother as she died. This would take a toll on anyone, and in this film his emotions constantly take over his decision making. As Yoda explains in ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,"" ""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."" This film shows Annakin's transition through these phases until he ultimately is not strong enough mentally to resist the temptation of the dark side of the force and Lord Sidious.
	This leads to one of the most intense battles in the entire Star Wars series as Annakin takes on his former master and friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi, solidifying his change of allegiance from the Jedi to the Sith. Prior to the fight, Obi-Wan addresses this change as he says, ""You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind, until now…until now you've become the very thing you swore to destroy."" This method of presenting the story was fantastic as it didn't focus on the major plot points that had already been spoiled, and instead highlighted the struggles of mental health and the effect that it can have on a person."
"Aug 04, 2020",5,"This is an absolut awesome movie... By far the best star wars movie ever . The visuals, dialouge, story and the fighting are in point, although the fight scene between palpatine and mace windu are a little disapointing. The acting is great especially Ewan McGregor as Obi wan. The only real thing i can point a finger at, is that this movie, like the other prequal movies, suffer from kinda bad written dialouge, mainly annakins actually, this is sad becasue apart from that Hayden Christensen did a really solid job playing Anakin.
All in All i rate this movie 9/10
Anders Mortensen, Denmark"
"Jul 31, 2020",5,"By far the greatest of the star wars movies, possibly George Lucas's magnum opus."
"Jul 31, 2020",4.5,This is where everything makes sense in the saga.
"Jul 31, 2020",5,The ultimate Star Wars film and my favorite movie of all time.
"Jul 25, 2020",5,This one really bought home the making Vader nicely. I would have only given four stars but it deserves the extra one for not being The Last Jedi.
"Jul 23, 2020",4,"Far and away the best of the prequel trilogy, I actually do just kind of overall enjoy this one in the larger Star Wars pantheon.  Don't get me wrong though, it still has serious problems.  While the CGI is way better than Episode I or II, there's a lot of times when it's still awkward and obvious.  Obi-Wan on a giant lizard will never look cool, as much as I really want that series of words to be awesome.  Padme in this entry is absolutely useless.  At least in Episode I she was headstrong, and in Episode II she had some action hero in her.  Here, she's just reduced to a pathetic woman sitting on the sidelines while the boys figure crap out around her.  There are also major issues with the story as a whole.  The action scenes are kind of forced in, and Anakin's ultimate turn to the dark side happens jarringly fast.  There's also some things that I know are expanded in the larger universe but here just happen way too fast, like Order 66.  But there are still enough improvements to make it warranted.  Anakin is a little better here.  His dialogue is awful, and he still whines too much, but when he doesn't have to talk and just has to give that Dark Side glare he can actually be a little intimidating.  The directing and pacing actually feels a lot better.  There's some sequences, like the end with the parallel hospital imagery, that are definitely on the nose in symbolism but they still work.  The action is great too.  Did we need an army of Wookies?  No, but I still liked it.  And the final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan is still incredible.  What makes it so good too is the brutality of it.  The Darth Maul fight was sleek, two opposing sides who knew what they stood for.  Here, there's so much raw emotion and power between the two and you feel it.  I actually noticed this viewing you can see how Anakin is trying to kill, but Obi-Wan very much plays defensively most of the fight, and little touches like that make it all the more effective.  And yeah, even when scenes are a little forced or underinformed, they can still work.  The Order 66 sequence for example, even if it is abrupt, is still effective.  So overall, yeah, I actually like this one.  It's far from perfect, and its flaws stick out like a sore thumb, but I still enjoy it enough to have had a few viewings in the past and probably a few more in the future."
"Jul 23, 2020",4.5,"This in my opinion is the best star wars movie. I don't think it is objectively, but it is super fun to watch. I don't think there's any other movie I would watch as much as this one for that reason. The lightsaber battles are great, it has a cool opening, the ending is tragic.. and after watching The Clone Wars and seeing a lot of prequel memes, this movie is great. The reason I didn't rate it 5/5 stars is because it does have some weird dialogue occasionally. (Spoiler) Padme's death is kind of dumb, the whole dying of sadness thing. The medical droid shouldn't have said ""she has lost the will to live"" right after saying they're losing her for unknown reasons. Doesn't make sense. The other parts definitely make up for it though."
"Jul 22, 2020",3.5,"The diamond in the rough. With all the thrills expected, Revenge of the Sith offers fans a proper tragic end to the trilogy that again is nearly ruined by clunky writing and lazy direction."
"Jul 21, 2020",5,"if perfection was made into a movie, it's my favourite all time movie, I've seen it around 20 times already and I really recommend it"
"Jul 20, 2020",4,"Spoilers Ahead: Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is an incredible ending to a pretty poor trilogy before this point. The final battle between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker is extremely powerful and exciting to watch. Seeing Anakin turn into Darth Vader feels rewarding for fans of the original trilogy, and Padame's reaction to Anakin turning to the dark side is written and performed excellently. The only thing holding it back is that the films before it are very weak so you don't feel as much of a build up or an attachment to the characters as you should of."
"Jul 19, 2020",5,"Great movie. Drama,characters, VFX, soundtracks etc"
"Jul 17, 2020",3.5,It was good but it was sad that all of the Jedi  died but at the end of the movie It got dark
"Jul 17, 2020",5,BEST MOVIE EVER IN HISTORY OF MOVIES MUST SEE RIGHT NOW!!
"Jul 16, 2020",4,"Details details details.... man.     
Arc-170's are awesome, lightsabers are cool, Jedi are dumb and that's okay, sith are powerful and lie and THAT is okay too.... clone betrayal is... well you end up having more a connection to it if you watch the clone wars tv show but it's good.... kinda...    but we walk a path that takes us to Vader that sees the brotherhood of Obi and Anakin come face to face            

And they do it pretty well honestly.    It's a great movie.   Not amazing       Plenty of bad dialogue again but heck.... I can forgive it...  when you don't get up for refills even though you are out of popcorn and soda and refuse to miss a moment even with a full bladder.... you earn your 4 stars immediately."
"Jul 16, 2020",3.5,"Easily the best of the Star Wars prequels. A good and entertaining movie, but that's about it."
"Jul 16, 2020",5,Easily the  best star wars movie ever made if you watch the clone wars show then it will make this movie even 10x better
"Jul 16, 2020",5,"This movie is the definition of perfection. Great visuals, good emotion, dialogue is spotty but not terrible, lots of action,and the best movie opening ever."
"Jul 15, 2020",4.5,"Even if the conclusion to the Prequels fails in some departments, it is way more emotional and powerful then we have seen before in the Star Wars saga. The action is intense and the scale of the battles are huge., The ending is bittersweet and that left us to just go to rewatch the Originals again."
"Jul 13, 2020",4,"Much better than the first two movies of the prequel trilogy. Lots of emotion, fun action sequences, and it almost reaches the greatness of the original trilogy."
"Jul 13, 2020",4.5,"Great action packed scenes along with very powerful emotional moments with great character moments from Anakin (Hayden Christensen), obi wan(Ewan McGregor), Palpatine(Ian McDiarmid), and others and although it's obvious flaws, continuity errors, and inconsistencies just keeping it from being 5 stars, it's overall a great movie and would recommend it."
"Jul 11, 2020",5,Excellent movie very entertaining. Probably the best light saber battle of all time.
"Jul 11, 2020",5,Meiner Meinung nach der Beste aller Star Wars-Teile. Das epische Finale der Prequel-Trilogie mit tollen Raumschlachten und Lichtschwertkämpfen. Besonders das Ausführen der Order 66 und die damit verbundene Machtübernahme der Sith hebt den Film von den anderen Filmen ab.
"Jul 10, 2020",4.5,"It's thrilling and amazing to see Anakin Skywalker as he turns to the dark side. Full of great action, thrilling dialogue and emotional resonance. One of if not the best Star Wars film ever made."
"Jul 09, 2020",4.5,Desde su inicio hasta el final es emocionante. La mejor de la trilogía de precuelas.
"Jul 08, 2020",2.5,A huge disappointment coming off the hot heels of The Epic Micro Series.
"Jul 06, 2020",4.5,"The best film of the Prequels, Revenge of the Sith is action packed and exciting. With several amazing lightsaber battles, and well-done character developments, this film is a great watch."
"Jul 06, 2020",5,Anakin's dark deeds are hauntingly and beautifully portrayed.
"Jul 04, 2020",5,Amazing Star Wars movie and one of the greatest films of all time. Every part of this movie is just awesome. My 2nd favorite movie of all time. I love this saga.
"Jul 04, 2020",5,"A must see.
A classic forever."
"Jul 01, 2020",5,"An amazing conclusion to Darth Vader's character arc. We see each character evolve and grow within this movie, which adds great depth to the original Star Wars trilogy."
"Jun 28, 2020",4.5,"Esta película es mi favorita de la saga, tiene tantos momentos épicos como la batalla en mustafar, la banda Sonora, ver como anakin cae al lado oscuro y su transformación en Darth Vader, esta película no es la mejor de la saga pero si la más épica de todas."
"Jun 27, 2020",3,The best of the prequels but the dialog is still ridiculous.
"Jun 24, 2020",5,"Best movie in the franchise!
10/10 music 
20/10 light saber battles 
10/10 memes
10/10 entertainment 
10/10 lore"
"Jun 20, 2020",5,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is my favorite Star Wars film and movie in general. I admit that Revenge does have some clunky dialogue but improved tenfold over the previous two films. Its clear that Revenge of the Sith is what the other prequels should've been, this is the story George Lucas wanted to tell from the start. We can't forget the memes from this movie, every sentence of the film can somehow be funny and i love it. Revenge of the Sith serves as an amazing conclusion to the prequels and is the perfect bridge between the prequels and the original trilogy. I love Revenge of the Sith!"
"Jun 20, 2020",5,The best of the prequels. I really like this sequel a lot and is a big improvement over the first two movies.
"Jun 18, 2020",4,"I love this movie!
It was interesting to see Star Wars take a darker tone with ROTS. This is by far Ian McDiarmid's best performance as Palpatine. Ewan McGregor also had a stand-out performance as Obi Wan and Hayden Christiansen was vastly better as Anakin than he was in AOTC. 
Anakin's turn to the dark side felt rushed without further context in the Clone Wars, but once he turned, the movie stepped up a notch. the Order 66 sequence was emotional and heartbreaking to see beloved characters killed off, but the score by John Williams made it so much better. 
The duel between Skywalker and Kenobi is extremely entertaining and visually beautiful.
Great movie and some of the best that Star Wars has to offer."
"Jun 16, 2020",4,"Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith is as everyone says the best of George Lucas's prequel trilogy. The separatist trade federation, led by alien cyborg General Grievous and the sith is still at war with the old Republic and we follow Jedi knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in their battles alongside clones and fellow jedi against drones and the sith. In a captivating open battle scene, Anakin slays the sith lord count Dooku and rescues the captive Chancellor Palpatine, who is clandestinely the sith overlord Darth Sidious manipulating the jedi order. Back home on Coruscant Anakin discovers his beautiful wife, Senator Padme Amidala, is pregnant. He soon has premonitions of his wife dying in childbirth. Meanwhile, he is becoming distrustful of the jedi council and desires greater power all the while being manipulated by Palpatine. He confesses all of this to his wife who does little to ease his woes apart from trying to comfort him by hugging and kissing him. At the same time, Palpatine claims to Anakin than there was a sith lord in the past who could use his powers to keep people from dying.
Meanwhile, Obi-Wan hunts down General Grievous and defeats a drone army led by the separatist trade federation before slaying Grievous in a mesmerizing lightsaber duel (Grievous had been trained in the Jedi arts by Count Dooku). Anakin soon discovers the true nature of Palpatine and alerts Jedi master Mace Windu who instructs Anakin to stay home as he confronts the sith lord among a few fellow jedi. Palpatine makes easy work the jedi other than Windu in a brief lightsaber duel before becoming cornered by Windu. Anakin arrives, against Windu's orders, to find Windu about to execute Palpatine. Anakin rescues Palpatine killing Windu and immediately fully turns to the darkside, pledging himself to the chancellor. Palpatine then gives orders to Anakin to slay Jedi padawans and gives orders to clone troops to slaughter Jedi Knights. He then enacts martial law and declares himself emperor. He sends Anakin (now Darth Vader) to execute the remaining separatist leaders and end the Civil War. While on the lava planet after executing the separatist leaders Anakin is confronted by his wife Padme who pleads with him to accompany him home and raise their child together and leave behind the sith. Vader scoffs and instead he offers her to rule the galaxy alongside him and take Emperor Palpatine's place. He claims he has become more powerful than the emperor. This upsets Padme and she cries ""Obi Wan was right, you've changed. I don't believe what I'm hearing."" This angers Vader and he put her in a force cholk, Obi Wan then reveals himself from Padme's ship in a surprise and makes Anakin let her go. An epic lightsaber duel between former brothers Anakin and Obi Wan then ensues. Meanwhile, Master Yoda has confronted Emperor Palpatine at his palace and they engage in a cool force, lightsaber duel. Palpatine defeats Yoda, but Yoda escapes and Obi Wan defeats Vader and Vader is deformed by lava and gets his legs decapitated but is rescued after Obi Wan leaves by Palpatine who gives him his robotic get up and mask.
Overall, the movie is darker and moodier in general than the previous prequels. It also has better acting, a more riveting story, and the best visuals. Anakin's descent to the dark side is captivating and haunting and the movie leaves you on the edge of your seat on more than one occasion."
"Jun 15, 2020",3,Overall there is not to much wrong with the plot.  There definitely should have been a little bit more time between Anikan becoming Darth Vader and him killing children and they should have gotten a better reason for Padme to die but the rest of the story is really good.  However  like all of the prequels this movie falls victim to bad lines and cgi.  Though the battle between Anikan and Obi-wan at the end is one of the best lightsaber duels in the franchise due to their emotion and their excellent ability with a light saber.  Overall if Disney remade this exact story with better lines then it would crush any of the sequels in quality and story.
"Jun 14, 2020",5,"Incredible soundtrack, intense action sequences! Acting could be a little better, but it's still not bad. The movie is great and i highly recommend!"
"Jun 14, 2020",4,"Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the best installment of George Lucas's prequel trilogy. With improved dialogue, exciting action scenes, and emotionally packed moments, Revenge of the Sith is easily a top 4 Star Wars movie. Order 66 is one of the saddest and most emotional scenes of the entire Skywalker Saga and it is ""executed"" (no pun intended) very well. However, there is a major part of this movie I dislike, and that is Anakin's turn to the dark side. I feel that it is very forced and underdeveloped, as the movie shows no reason or final blow to his turn. Overall, Revenge of the Sith is the best prequel, and a very good movie, with one major issue."
"Jun 13, 2020",5,It's Over Rotten Tomatoes! We've Got the High Ground!
"Jun 13, 2020",4,"A great film overall, the story is consistent, Anakin's turn to the Darkside is one of the best arcs in the whole Star Wars franchise and it has some of the best duels ever. The story is exciting and heartbreaking at the end.
It misses that 5th star because of the dialogue. I have a hard time believing Anakin and Padme's relationship, sometimes the dialogue can come out as quite corny and unnecessary.
Overall I think this is not a dialogue-driven movie, you watch Star Wars for the story and the passion, the love for lightsabers and blasters, for the love, the Jedi, and the Sith. This is what the movie nails perfectly."
"Jun 11, 2020",4,"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Review: 8.5/10

Pros:

Anakin and Palpatine's relationship is compelling

AWESOME chemistry b/n Anakin and Obi-Wan

An excellent final duel, end, and music

Cons:

Some terrible love dialogue once again

Parts of this film are way too ""in your face"""
"Jun 07, 2020",3,This is the best movie compared to the other prequel movies. But I still had problems with it. I don't like Anakin's turn. If he did it to save Padme and Padme still dies I don't know why he would still follow Palpatine. There are some odd scenes like seeing Chewbacca. But there are some enjoyable scenes like the lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin. I just wish this trilogy was better.
"Jun 05, 2020",3,"Decently made and a good ending to the Prequels! This movie is by far the most intense movie out of the three prequels! Near the end of the movie, there is a disturbing violence that may freak young ones(it freaked me out, aright). This, I think, is a bit poorer than the 2nd movie(see the review for Attack of the Clones). I give this 70% Rotten Tomatoes!"
"Jun 05, 2020",5,The best movie out of the star wars saga - anakan!!
"Jun 03, 2020",5,"Though the acting still isn't exactly good, McGregor is perfect. The CGI still looks great to this day and the whole story and all of the scenes are fantastic. George was finally able to properly execute a prequel film. Though the film timeline in unbelievable and rushed, Skywalker's turn to the dark side is believable and it will make you emotional especially after watching The Clone Wars."
"Jun 03, 2020",5,"This is easily the best out of the prequel trilogy. I always bought into Anakin's turn to the dark side. I think that the fight scenes are also very good. Every single one of them. There is an actual storyline in this one. It also feels pretty real. In this one, the bad guys win. That happens in reality. The good guys don't always win. And that lifts this movie up for me. Order 66 was heartbreaking, Anakin killing younglings was heartbreaking and the scene Padme realizes he turned to the dark side was so sad. Overall a very good film."
"Jun 01, 2020",5,10x better then the ST
"May 30, 2020",5,"The fight choreography in this movie is beautiful. Some of the dialogue can be awkward and confusing, but the way that is shows the light and dark is fantastic. This movie is now a favorite of mine."
"May 30, 2020",5,"Ótimo filme, principalmente na questão do Anakin se voltando para o lado negro da força"
"May 30, 2020",5,It is maybe hte best star wars movie it has so great fight scenes and looked great i loved ewan mc gregor as obi wan so much
"May 29, 2020",3.5,"The best of a disappointing bunch, the third film from the prequel trilogy has some very memorable moments. The transformation of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader is effective (but perhaps would have been more effective with a different actor)."
"May 28, 2020",5,No doubt the best Star Wars Movie ! 
"May 28, 2020",5,"A great film and an incredible ending to the George Lucas series of films.  Many people clump all three prequels together and label hem as bad. They are wrong, while The Phantom Menace may be so bad as to be unwatchable, Episode II is really, really good — if you could just green screen Natalie Portman out of it. This film, Revenge of the Sith is a masterpiece.  Incredible characters, like General Grievous; great action pieces, and a complex coming together of plot points in a very compelling story of political unraveling — George Lucas' story of deception Is really one of his finest pieces of writing. Time will tell, if this film never earned the praise it deserved, my guess is families will be watching this movie with their children long after the Disney Star Wars films have been forgotten."
"May 27, 2020",3.5,"Es una buena película, con mucho CGI, pero con partes lentas y que solo sirven para explicar, sin embargo nos regala uno de los mejores momentos de la saga con un acompañamiento de John Williams deslumbrante"
"May 27, 2020",5,A classic tragedy where the anti-hero fulfills his worst fears while trying desperately to avoid them.  Lucas makes his mark with this one.  It makes you wonder why he was so reviled that he was completely removed from the creative process for the final trilogy.
"May 26, 2020",5,"i love it, B E C A U S E O F O B I W A N!"
"May 25, 2020",5,"Excellent soundtrack, paired with exciting lightsaber fights and emotional moments make this an extremely enjoyable experience."
"May 25, 2020",5,this is in my opinion the most emotionally impact-full of the star wars movies it have by far the best action and overall ties the prequels to the originals nicely.
"May 25, 2020",3.5,"Senza dubbio il migliore della trilogia dei prequel, garantisce un buon impatto visivo e grande coinvolgimento emotivo in un finale ricco di pathos. La caratterizzazione dei vari personaggi risulta ben riuscita, sia per i protagonisti che per i personaggi secondari, con una sceneggiatura che punta tutti gli sforzi nella giusta direzione. Nel complesso è un degno finale ad una trilogia altalenante che conferma ancora una volta le sue enormi e, parzialmente sprecate, potenzialità."
"May 25, 2020",5,Amazing best of starwars
"May 24, 2020",4.5,This movie is truly epic.
"May 23, 2020",5,"Best film of star wars, it connects the precuels with the originals and we can see the fall and born of the most iconic villian of all times"
"May 23, 2020",4,Easily the best of the prequels and the lightsaber fights incredible 
"May 23, 2020",5,amazing love the new characters and how it connects into the original trilogy

"May 21, 2020",5,"Some of the best Star Wars ever, John Williams set the score on fire, the action was entertaining, and I'm gonna be honest, I cry every time."
"May 21, 2020",5,Best meme quality in the galaxy.
"May 21, 2020",5,The best Star Wars movie. I have nothing to answer for.
"May 21, 2020",5,"The best movie in the Star Wars saga. Words will not bring it justice, only watching it will."
"May 21, 2020",5,"There's too many of them Master Skywalker, what are we going to do?"
"May 21, 2020",5,"Even though many people think of it as a meme. It is actually a tragedy of a man who has to choose between a corrupted order or the dark side. It may not be the best Star Wars movie, it is a great film."
"May 21, 2020",5,One of my favorite films in the franchise.
"May 21, 2020",5,Shoulda won over batman...
"May 21, 2020",5,It's not easy executing a movie when everybody already knows the end: Revenge of the Sith did it perfectly!
"May 21, 2020",5,"After watching the Clone Wars series, this movie has a whole new depth. Taken together, it is an epic accomplishment."
"May 21, 2020",5,"A truly wonderful masterpiece not just for not just the men, but the women, and children too!"
"May 21, 2020",5,It was great and is a must see.
"May 20, 2020",5,"This film is undoubtedly the best in the franchise. If you're ever wondering whether or not to see it, my advice is to just ""Dew it."""
"May 20, 2020",5,Good soldiers follow orders
"May 20, 2020",5,Best of the prequels by far.
"May 20, 2020",5,"Many prequel era movies are bashed, but Revenge of the Sith is overall a great movie with one of the most emotional endings in all of Star Wars. 10/10."
"May 20, 2020",5,"I had a huge review written up, and then I had to tab over to verify my email address. My phone ate it.

So, to summarize - Do yourself a favor and watch this movie in the context thatnit was always meant to be. Watch the first two movies, then watch The Clone Wars, then watch this.

It might just help you to see why all of the crazy Star Wars fans are so passionate about the Prequel era. The Prequels are more than just the movies, and to ignore the context that leads to this movie is to do yourself a massive disservice.

That being said, you're going to resubscribe to Disney Plus to watch the second season of The Mandalorean anyway, so you might as well get context for Ahsoka's appearance there, too."
"May 20, 2020",5,Best of the prequel trilogy. 100% would grant the rank of master.
"May 20, 2020",5,"The greatest story ever told, better than the bible!"
"May 20, 2020",5,"Truly a cinematic masterpiece. One that will, without doubt, go down in history as the best film of all time."
"May 20, 2020",5,"The movie that breaks your heart. Honestly ruined the rest of my day after watching this movie because you can't help but root for Anakin even though you know exactly how it will go. 

A fantastic movie."
"May 20, 2020",5,This is such an underrated movie. Sure some of the dialogue can get cheesy but it is still is sooo good and definitely worth watching a couple hundred times.
"May 20, 2020",5,Amazing. Beautiful. Truly breathtaking
"May 20, 2020",5,"My #1 favorite movie, endless re-watchability, everyone must see this at least once."
"May 20, 2020",5,This has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember. The story is amazing and complex. The emotion is intense especially when it comes time for brothers in arms to fight each other. The dialogue can be weird sometimes but everything about this film overshadows that you the point where I never notice bad dialogue. 6/5 stars
"May 20, 2020",5,Hello there. General Kenobi!
"May 20, 2020",5,"The movie is at the absolute PINNACLE of greatness. It' calming, funny, scary, gives you goosebumps. It's sad and yet satisfying."

"May 20, 2020",5,A good clone follows orders
"May 20, 2020",5,"Despite shortcomings of missing fanboys expectations of what they wanted to see at the time, this movie has proven to be the best in the entire Star Wars series. The script is an under appreciated masterpiece, tying up loose ends and ultimately leading towards the need for A New Hope."
"May 20, 2020",5,An absolute master piece. After watching my shingles were cured and I learnt to walk again. I was previously completely smooth but have since grown enough hair for people to mistake me for a brown bear. My only complaint is the large amounts of sand throughout the movie.
"May 20, 2020",5,"For the REPUBLIC!!

For the REPUBLIC!!
For the REPUBLIC!!"
"May 20, 2020",5,ROTS is strong and wise and I'm very proud of it!

"May 20, 2020",5,Best star wars movie in the whole franchise.
"May 20, 2020",5,"The perfect movie.  If you aren't watching this at least 8 times a day you're wasting your time doing whatever else.  I personally have it running on my TV, phone and laptop."
"May 20, 2020",5,"This movie is one of my favorites of all time. I have watched it multiple times and I never grow bored of it. This movie really serves the characters that appear in the Original Trilogy well and fleshes out their backstories. On top of that, the entire franchise is a staple of Americana at this point and this is one of the favorites of the generation that will carry the franchise into the future."
"May 20, 2020",5,Just plain old cinema greatness! It's one of the most quotable movies in cinema history and deserves its place at the golden throne!
"May 20, 2020",5,One of my favourite films of all time. The only Star Wars film I rate higher than Rogue One.
"May 20, 2020",5,"Oh, it's beautiful. One of the best movies I've seen. It's lore is deep but presentation is kept simple. This is where the fun begins"
"May 20, 2020",5,Underrated masterpiece
"May 20, 2020",5,One of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.
"May 20, 2020",5,This is the perfect movie. And only enhanced by clone wars
"May 20, 2020",5,"I watched this movie as a child and thought it was fantastic. I Re-Watched it recently and still enjoyed it tremendously. The acting was good, the CGI stands up even today, and the plot was top notch."
"May 20, 2020",5,Truly an under appreciated masterpiece by the masses. This film manages to tell a mature tale of betrayal and political scheming in an entertaining way for anyone to enjoy.
"May 20, 2020",5,An utter masterpiece.
"May 20, 2020",5,"In my opinion, this is the best star wars movie out there."
"May 20, 2020",5,A masterpiece that magnificently reflects the danger of the dark side of the Force.
"May 20, 2020",5,Good soldiers follow orders.
"May 20, 2020",5,The Dark Knight Rises is an awful film
"May 20, 2020",5,Amazing movie. The best of the prequel trilogy!
"May 20, 2020",5,Loved it. I must have seen it at least 20 times. It was my favorite movie growing up and still is my favorite star wars movie to date. Everyone should see it.
"May 20, 2020",5,"Great movie, open-ended, CGI is even more amazing, didn't expect that from Anakin oof. Good quotes and many memeable scenes, perfect (read as sad) end to the Clone Wars, makes you think about nowadays, as this saga has many stuff comparable to IRL (On the time of their release). 10/10"
"May 20, 2020",5,you underestimate my power
"May 20, 2020",5,Best movie ever made. Period
"May 20, 2020",5,Every single shot every moment was interesting best star wars movie by far every model made me curious
"May 20, 2020",5,Good soldier's follow orders
"May 20, 2020",5,For the Republic!!!!
"May 20, 2020",5,"Honestly, I though this movie was excellent before, especially given the problems Attack of the Clones left for it. BUT, having now watched The Clone Wars this movie has so much more emotion, feeling, and context. Plus, Hayden Christensen's acting is better than it first appears if you pay attention to the details. You can tell how tortured Anakin is through all of it and how much he's agonizing over everything internally."
"May 20, 2020",5,Best light saber fights ever.
"May 20, 2020",5,A fine addition to the saga.
"May 20, 2020",5,Best Starwars Movie Hands Down!
"May 20, 2020",5,The greatest Star Wars movie in all the aspects. CGI is not a problem for me.
"May 20, 2020",5,It was the best movie ever.
"May 20, 2020",5,Best film I've ever seen. I have the fondest memories of it from my childhood. The memes it spawned are just beautiful. Obiwan is just the best here. The best Star Wars film out there!
"May 20, 2020",5,Easily the best of the Prequel Trilogy.
"May 20, 2020",5,Empire Strikes Back may be the best Star Wars movie but this is by far the most fun. The lightsaber fights are amazing and the score is one of the best in the series. Ewan McGregor gives it his all in this and you can tell he's having so much fun.
"May 20, 2020",5,Why is this movie great?..... Because of Obi-wan
"May 20, 2020",5,Hello there. General Kenobi. You are a bold one
"May 20, 2020",5,"The epic, emotionally charged conclusion to the Clone Wars. Episode 3 was a hero, we just couldn't see it yet."
"May 20, 2020",5,amazing movie a must see
"May 20, 2020",4.5,"Truly one of the best Star Wars movies to date. The flaws are few and far between, while the amazing effort from the cast and crew really shows!

The prequels as a whole may have been mediocre, but it ended with a spectacular bang, from a man who clearly had a vision. Which can't be said the same for the sequel trilogy."
"May 20, 2020",5,"A masterpiece in filmmaking, with memorable quotes.  A great end to the Sequel Trilogy, and ties into the Original Trilogy with ease."
"May 20, 2020",5,"Wow, the best Star Wars of the prequels. Better than all of the Disney Sequel Trilogy."
"May 20, 2020",5,"This film is a cinematic masterpiece.  A tale of good vs evil, light vs dark, romance and betrayal it has it all.  A must see for any cinophile"
"May 20, 2020",5,"It's easily my favorite of the Prequels and of the entire Saga. You can watch it by itself and the story stands strong. You can watch it with the rest of the Prequels and it's a fantastic finale. You can skip the first 2 Prequels and watch this immediately after Empire Strikes Back and it still works fantastically without the extra context.

This movie is a testament to George Lucas' skill as a world builder, a character creator, and a story teller."
"May 20, 2020",5,This movie was an amazing conclusion to the prequel trilogy. It also works very well to set up the begining of the Original Trilogy. The emotionally charged ending is one of the best examples of emotional storytelling in cinema.
"May 20, 2020",5,"Absolutely amazing, the movie is the perfection of star wars"
"May 20, 2020",5,Gooooooooooooooooood
"May 20, 2020",5,"A perfect conclusion to this trilogy. This film's content does a precise job of redeeming the first two films, as well as setting the stage for the original trilogy. Aside from that, the film's score, cinematography, and costuming show that the crew worked very hard on this film as well, which pays off. A Star Wars movie everyone should see, and will enjoy."
"May 20, 2020",5,A fantastic film that shows Anakin's descent into the dark side as he struggles to understand the Jedi ways. I love the flow of this story to show how he becomes the infamous Darth Vader.
"May 20, 2020",4,"Great film and best of the prequels! The space battle, story, and music was all fantastic. Despite the fact everything that happened on screen happened within 5-10 days. Anakin's heel turn and betrayal of the Jedi order and killing younglings only happened within 1-2 days of learning Padme was pregnant."
"May 20, 2020",5,"Easily one of the most beautiful and emotionally profound movies out there. the raw emotion and grief at the ending is enough to make anyone cry. It's great how they also bothered to address moral issues in the movies as well, with showing how the war was pointless, how most politicians can be corrupted by power and greed and that ""The war represents a failure to listen."" The characters are all amazing, and the CGI is wonderful. Good soldiers follow orders."
"May 20, 2020",5,It was very good. One of the best SW movies.
"May 19, 2020",5,"Amazing movie! It is my fav Star Wars movie.Yes it has some dialogue issues and not that great cgi, however the plot was on point, respecting the lore and giving us amazing duels and moments that are still the first thing to remember  when you talk about Star Wars."
"May 19, 2020",3.5,"Another film I went to see as a young child and was my favourite but as time went on this film could have done alot more than it did , not the worst film in the saga but certainly not the best."
"May 19, 2020",5,Hands down has the best duels in the series.
"May 19, 2020",5,Greatest movie of not only the entire series but of all time!!!
"May 19, 2020",5,Truly the best Star Wars movie of all time. Clearly better than that one batmann movie no one ever cared about.
"May 19, 2020",5,Absolute Masterpiece
"May 19, 2020",5,Absolute masterpiece.
"May 19, 2020",5,Best movie in the OT.
"May 19, 2020",5,This is a thrilling movie with great action and great plot.
"May 19, 2020",5,"It has its ups and downs, but i mostly like the overarcing story of the prequels."
"May 19, 2020",5,bruh it was so spicy like that scene mmmmmmm nice
"May 19, 2020",1,"Revenge Of The Sith is the most watchable movie out of the prequel trilogy but it is far from being a good Star Wars movie and even further from being a good movie. Bad acting, awkward line delivery, boring choreography, characters contradicting themselves, characters acting out of character, fan service that makes lines from the original trilogy make no sense, scenes that overstay their welcome, its got the whole bad movie package and more. If for whatever reason you do decide to watch Revenge Of The Sith, watch it ironically with friends, it's a so bad it's laughable movie. If you're going to watch it unironically and take it seriously however, it isn't a guilty pleasure because you will feel no pleasure, only guilt. Revenge Of The Sith is everything you shouldn't do when making a movie. If you're looking for a good Star Wars movie, A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is your best bet because it's definitely not here."
"May 19, 2020",5,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Far better than the dark knight rises
"May 19, 2020",5,Best Star Wars Movie hands down.
"May 19, 2020",5,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the Midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic.
He could save others from death, but not himself."
"May 19, 2020",5,This movie gave so many emotions and tied in to the original very well
"May 19, 2020",5,It was a cinematic master piece and it is one of the best things ever also dont watxh the sequels they are trash
"May 19, 2020",5,"The movie is the greatest movie I have ever seen. It explains the fall of the republic and Jedi and the rise of the empire. It shows how we get some of our most iconic characters like Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leah."
"May 19, 2020",1,"RotS, while slightly better than the other prequels, is still filled with plot holes and bad acting."
"May 19, 2020",3,"Revenge of the Sith is arguably the best film in the prequel trilogy. The special effects are crazy and the film ties in very well with the original trilogy. The script, the story and the acting improve a lot compared to 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones' but the dialogues between Anakin and Padme are still lacking, the impression is that Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) has not received good indications on how to interpret the character. The film is still very epic and the duels with lightsabers are spectacular."
"May 19, 2020",5,"In my opinion as a non Star Wars fan, the best of them all."
"May 19, 2020",5,It's one of the prequels. What did you expect?
"May 19, 2020",5,The BEST star wars movie ever
"May 18, 2020",5,It's quite possibly the best movie ever
"May 18, 2020",5,so amazing. love it along with all of the memes it has brought.
"May 18, 2020",5,Love it! Actors did a great job!
"May 18, 2020",5,Best movie ever made. Creamed my pants every time obi wan spoke. If you don't like this movie you dont understand culture
"May 17, 2020",5,It was pretty frickin great ngl
"May 17, 2020",5,"amazing, a great conclusion to the era"
"May 17, 2020",4.5,"Revenge Of The Sith, where do I begin, the cast are way better than they were in Attack Of The Clones and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is way better in this one. The reasons on why he's better is due to him having better dialogue which works well and it's quite a small thing but his facial expressions when he's taking with other characters show him to be quite an angry and annoyed character, not really shown as the whiny brat he was in Episode 2. Also, the fight scenes here are very fun and engaging not like the ones in Attack Of Clones, we get to meet some new villains and witness some brilliant fight scenes with them. Honestly, my favourite fight scenes throughout this movie would have to be the one where it's General Grevious Vs Obi-Wan Kenobi and the final fight scene where it's Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) vs Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) those fight scenes are always amazing to watch. Finally, the Revenge Of The Sith has got an amazing plot with a brilliant ending which links up perfectly to A New Hope. Overall, I'd honestly say this is my favourite prequel and it might be one of my favourite Star Wars movies, it's honesty worth the watch."
"May 17, 2020",5,"Revenge of the Sith is my favorite Star Wars movie. There are some lines of dialogue that aren't very good but it is very enjoyable. I don't know how people can call this movie boring there is always some action and of course, that is a lot of fun."
"May 17, 2020",4.5,"Yes, we see the rise of Darth Vader and not just the fall of Anakin Skywalker, but the fall of the Jedi. The clones troopers (that were introduced into the Star Wars universe in Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones) betray the Jedi by an order given to them by Darth Sidious known as Execute Order 66. This was an order to kill all the Jedi. Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi were our only survivors. Also we see Anakin's fear of losing Padme due to child birth, so Anakin is desperate to learn a power that no other Jedi could learn. Therefore he joins Palpatine in order to try and save his wife. But really in the end nothing works out for both of them."
"May 17, 2020",5,That film was so good. I can´t wait to watch it again. The whole film was epic.
"May 17, 2020",5,"Clearly the end of Lucas' vision for star wars, a perfect twist to the beginning of a space-epoque."
"May 17, 2020",4.5,Love it but might be a little bit overrated
"May 16, 2020",5,"Exciting and emotional conclusion to the prequel trilogy, it manages to make up for most of the previous movies flaws."
"May 16, 2020",4,"TLDR a mediocre independent movie, but a crucial part to the entire Star Wars franchise.
The movie was kind of screwed from the start due to the ending, but it sorta worked out.
Fans (for the most part) like it, non-fans not so much. Probably because of the ridiculously amount of duels and how it wraps up the Clone Wars and a whole bunch of characters, which is emotional for people who followed it. 
For everybody else it's a warzone. It personally got better for me over time as I discovered little details about the plot (especially about the Emperor) and this support it gets from the outside makes the characters not necessarily well-written, but thoroughly written."
"May 16, 2020",5,It's a great movie it really shows the darkness of the sith it's amazing I really would suggest watching it with the clone wars show it really shows how much anakin betrayed and how good of a person he actually was
"May 14, 2020",4.5,"Revenge of the Sith delivers the best wrap up of a story that leads into the original trilogy. Despite knowing exactly what must happen for the storyline to keep its continuity, the film still excels in bringing jaw dropping sequences as well as beautiful writing. The tale of a long planned betrayal that swings the fate of the entire galaxy and brings about the end of a ultimately pointless war."
"May 14, 2020",3,these movies may not have been better than the originals but I do believe that this one sums up what episodes iv-vi are about
"May 13, 2020",4.5,"This is one of my favorite movies in the Star Wars trilogy. An extremely epic, yet devistating movie. Great actors as well."
"May 12, 2020",5,"It was like biting into a grilled cheese sandwich that you just made only to realize that the cheese was made of gold, the bread was zesty, and somehow, there was perfectly cooked bacon in between layers of Fresh Tomatoes and lettuce.
This movie perfectly demonstrated how an empire came to be, I found the political side to genuinely interesting, character motivations that were sound and legitimate, and the best action scenes I have ever seen in any movie.
Right away, the viewer is brought into a thrilling space battle where we get to learn about the protagonists and we see the humanity in Anakin. The film shows how Anakin is shifted to the dark side which helps us understand his humanity and how he had enough left to come back to the light side many years later. The sound design is fantastic and there is a lot of clever dialogue. There is so much emotion in this movie and it is greatly helped by the superb acting of the actors. Honestly, I could talk about this movie for a while but to me, the main thing is that when I watch this film I always seem to enjoy it and all of its aspects intertwine very nicely.
In my opinion it's a great movie."
"May 11, 2020",4,"By far the best movie of the Prequel trilogy. The film is not without it's flaws, but has a lot it tries to accomplish. It doesn't quite succeed on all counts, but it leaves the viewer with a tremendous appreciation for the imagination of George Lucas."
"May 10, 2020",5,WAY better than Disney
"May 07, 2020",3.5,"best of the prequels. Could be the fourth best film in the franchise. The pacing of the movie is pretty good compared to the previous 2. I feel as if the film doesn't hold up that well, when I watch it now. Only a few actors in the film seem like they know how to act. Being Sam Jackson and Ewan McGregor. The end fight scene is worth the watch alone. Simply a popcorn film for the family."
"May 07, 2020",4.5,"Supera por mucho las dos anteriores, vemos un Anakin con el que simpatizamos mas con 30 minutos de pelicula que en todo lo que mostró en el episodio anterior.
La pelicula está en constante movimiento de principio a fin, un Obi-Wan increible y un duelo final vs Anakin que a mi parecer es el mejor de toda la saga. De las mejores peliculas de Star Wars, sin duda."
"May 07, 2020",3.5,"Tied up the prequels well and linked the story to the original trilogy. Despite the movie being relatively lengthy, Anakin's turn to the dark side and the end of the Clone Wars with Grievous, seemed rushed and ill-explained. Visually, having been filmed mostly in front of a green screen, the film shows its age. The music is phenomenal, being some of the best in the entire Skywalker saga."
"May 05, 2020",4,"After two bad prequels, the series is good good again."
"May 05, 2020",4.5,This movie is my 3rd favorite in the franchise. Anakin hands down is the best character in Star Wars. The way you see Anakin slowly turn to the dark side is sad but also amazing how good Hayden Christensen did making you feel sad for the character. The fight scenes are amazing especially the Obi wan and Anakin fight and the opening fight scene. The dialogue can be a little bad at times but overall everyone kills and is a good movie
"May 05, 2020",5,It is a cinematic masterpiece and it's my favorite movie 11/10
"May 05, 2020",4,"I really like this one. While I do think it’s my bias toward Star Wars in general and the fact the the films enhanced by the Clone Wars CG show, I still like it. The effects are pretty good for the time. It’s pretty entertaining. The acting and writing is that good but I’ve come to except that from Lucas. I feel this is a guilty pleasure for me, second only to Con Air."
"May 05, 2020",5,"It is hard to express how amazing this film is. It is a flying success in all its areas. The acting is near perfect, with Hayden Christiensen giving his most convincing performance as Anakin, and Ewan McGregor delivering an outright iconic Obi-Wan Kenobi. Together they sell you the brotherhood of these two characters so well that by the end, you're throwing your money at them begging for more. The plot is so engaging, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat as the events unfold, even though we've known for over 40 years what would happen. It'll have you laughing with the casually witty banter in the opening scene, and crying at the heartbreaking climax between Anakin and Obi-Wan. At the same time, John Williams creates some of his most iconic music since the originals. The sadness you feel as the orchestra and choir swell during Order 66 is immense. Throughout the film, the music is immersive, and plays a truly important role in the flow of the film. Lastly, this is a visually stunning film. The ILM team attempts some of their most ambitious effects to date, and the execution is perfect. The effects are flawless and convincing. Overall this is a truly great film. It is emotional, beautiful, and a perfect end to the saga. I think is is vastly misunderstood. This film, as well as the other prequels, were never meant to be like the originals. They're more poetic, more dramatic, and this film is the pinnacle of George Lucas' intentions. I rank it 3rd in the entire eleven film canon behind only A New Hope and Empire (of course). Even outside of Star Wars it is one of my favourite films of all time, it deserves some serious respect. It is a fun, exciting, heartbreaking story, and seeing the title scroll onto the screen at the beginning of the film always makes me smile. I truly do enjoy watching this film. Isn't that what makes a movie great?"
"May 04, 2020",1.5,I remember this movie well. Some of the worst dialogue I've ever experienced in a movie. A missed opportunity. Avoid.
"May 04, 2020",4,"Impressive, it is incredible that this film can move despite one already knows its end from before. For those who are looking for a movie identical to the first ones with a luke and a han only because you are not going to enjoy it, this movie is great for its history, not for its resemblance to the originals, for that you better go see episode 7 .."
"May 04, 2020",3.5,"Favorite Star Wars of this series. Anakin has no enthusiasm, not a fan of his. Still a great ending and story."
"May 04, 2020",5,"Revenge of the Sith is one of, if not the best movie within the skywalker saga. It is a dramatic ending to the prequel trilogy. The effects still hold up and it has the best lightsaber duel in all of Star Wars. There are multiple moments when you think about it deeper you get to see the true meaning of Anakin's saga. I would highly recommend!"
"May 04, 2020",4,The best out of the prequels
"May 02, 2020",5,We need more movies like this
"May 02, 2020",4,"Better than the other two prequels, but not without its directorial shortcomings. I really like how this film sets up the originals. Definitely the darkest and most captivating of the prequels."
"Apr 29, 2020",5,"Just incredible. Action, choreography, cinematography, dialogue, plot, characters, music, special effects &amp; costume design at their best. My second favorite Star Wars movie, EVER."
"Apr 25, 2020",4,A tragic and dramatic story with unusually good acting compared to the previous prequels that almost redeems them.
"Apr 22, 2020",5,My favourite movie of all time!!
"Apr 22, 2020",3.5,"While Rise of Skywalker nearly ruined its own trilogy, Revenge of the Sith nearly save its own. Lucas still doesn't have a real good grasp on story tone or plot tempo (two fairly important things for a director to control), he manages to create a finale that is not only far-and-away the most inventive and fun of the prequels, it's actually just good old-fashioned escapism. Performances are better (even Christensen), &amp; the political thematics are gripping (""So this is how liberty dies…with thunderous applause."")"
"Apr 21, 2020",3,I mean... there was lots of good parts but just the same as the other prequels 
"Apr 20, 2020",4.5,"3538/5000
I will not make a real criticism but rather a counter argument against the haters. Let's start to say why I like this film: simply thanks to its good OST (at the same time John Williams) coupled with wonderful action scenes, a good representation of the conspiracies and political developments that there have been in course of our History (Republic [Roman, French, of Weimar] becomes Empire) and especially the great moments of emotions which begin little by little: Anakin does not want to drop Obi-Wan; Padmé reveals that she is pregnant; forgiveness of Anakin to Obi-Wan, Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader, Order 66, Obi-Wan discovers the massacre of the Padawans, Vader strangles his wife, the fight between the former master and apprentice, Vader burns under the gaze of 'Obi-Wan and finally the simultaneous sequences of the tapering of the armor and the birth of Padmé! Special mention to the reply that each child must repeat when playing Star Wars; I will comment on them later.
Small parenthesis. Before attacking what is annoying with this film, let us launch into the Prelogy. According to my personal tastes: III&gt; VI&gt; IV&gt; V&gt; I&gt; II with regard to the Star Wars saga. Although I'm indifferent to episode II and find episode I just ... cute, I have to defend the Prelogy. Admittedly, I do not believe that it would have been necessary to make a prequel but here it is: SW is a saga of film for child, whether you believe it or not. That explains the Ewoks, Jar Jar Binks, Yoda the puppet, a bearded old fool, robotic comics-reliefs, etcteri etctera. And at the end of episode I, instead of growing up with the public of the Trilogy (as Harry Potter would have done), this episode is very childish (not immature, attention), you just have to listen to the music to to notice. On the other hand, the Prélogie, it grew with its fans. Episode II is for teens. And episode III is more adult. TO fans wanted to feel the emotions
they had but Lucas's goal was to introduce the new SW generation. And I'm not against it! That explains why the old people like the Trilo and the younger ones the Prélo.

Now ROTS!

"Apr 20, 2020",5,"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, es una gran película, la mejor de las precuelas, me atrevo a decir la mejor de la saga, George ha hecho un trabajo memorable en su dirección, guión y producción, fortaleciendo sus aciertos y sus debilidades. Los efectos visuales y el maquillaje han envejecido muy bien a pesar de los 15 años del estreno, por allá en mayo del 2005. La banda sonora de Williams ha sido de lo mejor que he escuchado en años, las actuaciones y los diálogos han mejorado con respecto a sus antecesoras, además de su gran ritmo en la narrativa.
Al lado más personal, está película me ha marcado desde mi infancia hasta hoy, le tengo un gran cariño, es un film oscuro, trágico, triste, dramático y emocionante a la vez, con un desenlace que refleja que no todo está perdido, que siempre hay un lado de luz en un camino lleno de miedo, maldad y oscuridad, eso se llama Esperanza."
"Apr 19, 2020",3.5,The best episode among the prequel trilogy. Great to watch Anakin slowly succumbing to the dark side and ending up being Darth Vader.
"Apr 18, 2020",4.5,"Good, George Lucas, good. Watch it. Watch it now.
Dew it."
"Apr 18, 2020",5,Simply amazing. The best of the entire franchise and with epic and satisfying scenes.
"Apr 17, 2020",4.5,The perfect ending and closure for the prequels! A must see!
"Apr 17, 2020",4,"While the acting may be iffy at times and some of he effects look dated by today's standards, but the most Shakespearean of the Star Wars films is the darkest and most action packed or all the Star Wars films in existence, to its benefit."
"Apr 16, 2020",5,"My favorite Star Wars movie so far because, I just love the Sith they’re my absolute favorite and in my head I’d rather be Darth Vader than Anakin Skywalker"
"Apr 14, 2020",4,"Although still somewhat shaky, Revenge of the Sith is still LIGHTYEARS better than Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones thanks to it's gritty tone, performances, improved dialogue, and, as always, John WIlliams' score."
"Apr 11, 2020",3.5,The holy grail of prequel memes.
"Apr 10, 2020",5,"The best Star Wars movie by far, with skilled lightsaber combat, love relationship, and fear to the dark side, I give this movie 5 stars "
"Apr 10, 2020",5,O melhor desse trilogia pequela
"Apr 09, 2020",5,"This is the greatest Star Wars film of all time, EASILY!!!  So much is to be said about it.  It is the perfect conclusion to make the prequels better than they were before.  We have always wanted to know the story of how Anakin Skywalker became arguably the most powerful, recognizable, and feared Sith of all time: Darth Vader.  Everything from Anakin and Obi-Wan's friendship going into a downward spiral, to Anakin's emotion taking control, to the persuasion of Palpatine, to the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise is masterful and poetic.  But this movie has also inspired one thing that will forever dominate this film: the memes.  I mean ""Hello There,"" ""High Ground,"" ""Dew it,"" ""Fine Addition to My Collection,"" ""Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?""... I mean EVERYTHING is perfectly awesome.  And it ends with probably the BEST fight scene in the history of cinema on Mustafar.

HOLY CRAP GO WATCH THIS MOVIE OR YOU ARE WASTING YOUR LIFE!!!"
"Apr 09, 2020",5,"One of the greatest ever! Perfectly concludes the Prequel Trilogy while laying out the backstories of Vader, Obi-Wan and Palpatine."
"Apr 08, 2020",4,8.5/10 I think this is so underrated. The fight scenes are cool. The scenes where they execute order 66 are cool. I don’t get the hate. 
"Apr 07, 2020",3.5,"I think Lucas does a pretty good job tying up his story to the original trilogy, despite being uneven at times. It's entertaining and certainly a step up from Episodes I and II."
"Apr 06, 2020",4,"Time has been kind to the Prequels. Following the Disneysasters, the forgiveness of Lucas has been justly accelerated. 
Revenge of the Sith was always the most beloved of the prequels, both for its story content and for its final referencing of the OT aesthetic.
Rewatching the films in chronological order, RotS truly becomes the linchpin of not merely the prequels, but the entire saga. It is the film that turns the little boy of two movies past irrevocably into the villain.  It is the film that justifies the shadowy Vader's 2 dimensionality for most of the OT.

Revenge of the Sith may be the favorite of only a few (but growing) fans, but it deserves such reverence."
"Apr 05, 2020",5,Not only the best of the prequels but the best of the sequels extremely emotional but if you want to get the full weight of this movie watch the clone wars first
"Apr 05, 2020",4,"This is the best performance for this movie in this prequel.George Lucas really captures his imagination in reality even though its a 2005 film but the CGI is better than the previous I hope Lucas will capture this story of how Anakin becomes Darth Vader.The moments with the clones, droids and systems of how the republic works.One of my problems in the movie was of how weak is the dialog for Anakins responses to others and the movie shown how weak was General Grevious even thought he is known to be the Jedi killer in the republic"
"Apr 01, 2020",4,"The best of the prequel trilogy has the answer to how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Anakin's struggles with the dark side on full display, this is the most emotionally gripping film of the prequel trilogy. Too bad it took three movies to get it right."
"Mar 31, 2020",5,A visual masterpiece with a strong storyline that saves the prequels from mediocrity
"Mar 29, 2020",0.5,"Tragic incompetence. Terrible actor for ""Anakin"", deaf and blind casting, boring Regisseur."
"Mar 27, 2020",5,One of my favorite movies and favorite Star Wars movie 
"Mar 27, 2020",4,A great ending to the maligned but misunderstood prequel trilogy
"Mar 26, 2020",2,"This Star Wars prequel was just ok. Hayden Christianson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and the rest of the cast did a decent job in this movie. The plot to the movie was alright, but it should've been better. The special effects and the action scenes were pretty cool. In my opinion, Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and this one were the worst Star Wars movies of them all. I wouldn't recommend them."
"Mar 26, 2020",2,The best of the prequels.
"Mar 25, 2020",5,"This is the best Star Wars movie I've ever seen. I don't think that I would like another Star Wars movie better than this one. I love every movie, but this one is my favorite. It really shows how Anakin becomes evil and turns in Darth Vader. I think it's very important to watch in the Star Wars Saga. It's probably the most important film of the main story IMO. Also, there's lots of action going on in this movie which is really fun to watch. There's so many lightsaber duels in it."
"Mar 24, 2020",5,This film is grossly underappreciated and I honestly think it's  as good as the original trilogy the Anakin's character is handled a lot better in this movie an I really like his interaction between Anakin and obi wan you really get a feeling that they've become close friends over the course of the war which makes the conclusion of the duel on mustafar all the more emotional Anakin's fall to the dark side is also very well done as you actually understand him and even feel bad for him I think this movie is really good and it even makes the originals better
"Mar 24, 2020",5,Best out of the Saga.
"Mar 24, 2020",4,Top 3 star Wars movies &amp; Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker is top 2 Characters in the entire movie franchise for me
"Mar 24, 2020",5,"I can't lie, nostalgia brings this from four stars to five. But I think this is the star wars movie with the best story to tell, and although there are problems with the execution, that says a lot for this nearly 50 year old franchise."
"Mar 23, 2020",5,esta estuvo bastante chula y ver al final al darth vader molo bastante
"Mar 23, 2020",5,"This movie is amazing. It shows a perfect ending for the prequel trilogy.
It's a shame that they didn't show dark Anakin fighting other jedi."
"Mar 22, 2020",4,lucas wasn't afraid to go dark however the dialouge is weird
"Mar 22, 2020",3.5,"Revenge of the Sith is a satisfying albeit flawed conclusion to the Star Wars prequel trilogy, with bombastic action, interesting narrative choices and solid acting despite the irregular dialogue prominent in the prequels."
"Mar 21, 2020",2,Lucas’s vision comes full circle here... but I haven’t cared enough to this point and ultimately leads where you’d expect 
"Mar 19, 2020",4,"This one is a guilty pleasure of mine. Yes, it can be dumb. Yes, it can be cringey. But overlying all of that is rich emotion and gripping action. Also, GRIEVOUS! 89%."
"Mar 18, 2020",5,One ofmthe bests of Star Wars. Spectacular from start to end
"Mar 17, 2020",5,Such an underrated movie. Best fight scenes in cinema
"Mar 16, 2020",5,"This one is a MUST see if you ever watched the first original trilogy. Watching the Prequel Trilogy will show what happened before Luke and Leia were born, before showing us how it ends. The ending was pretty sad, but it was still great! Some of them were funny as well from C-3PO and R2-D2."
"Mar 16, 2020",5,Absolutely fabulous aside from some of hayden christensens performance
"Mar 15, 2020",4,really dark film in the star wars world up there with the best
"Mar 13, 2020",4.5,"E uno dei film più riusciti della saga, se non il migliore. Spettacolare visivamente, e accattivante, appassionante, riflessivo profondamente."
"Mar 12, 2020",4,Hands down the darkest Star Wars film and the best movie in the prequel trilogy. This may not be the prettiest Star Wars movie to look at but it does have an amazing plot. Revenge of the Sith does a awesome job at showing Anakin Skywalker turning into Darth Vader.
"Mar 12, 2020",4,"Dark, Fun, Amazing, and watchable is what Revenge of the Sith is compared to the other prequels."
"Mar 11, 2020",5,"This film is exelent, this film does´t have a single and the sountrack is vary famous and is estremaly fine. The special effects are amazing for 1990."
"Mar 10, 2020",4.5,Anakin's fall to the dark side felt rushed and extreme but overall this is an excellent Star Wars film and a redeeming end to the prequel trilogy whose first two films were pretty poor. 
"Mar 09, 2020",5,My absolute favorite movie of all time
"Mar 09, 2020",4,"Regardless of its flaws, the Revenge of the Sith is a pretty fun and exciting addition to the ever-growing Star Wars franchise."
"Mar 08, 2020",5,"Incredible movie, incredible Star Wars movie, my personal favorite. A must see. Rounds out the prequel trilogy with precision and drama in the style of a Shakespearean tragedy."
"Mar 08, 2020",4,"The prequels, in general, get too much hate. This is the best of them. Anakin's story of transformation into Darth Vader is a great one. The acting and some of the dialogue is a bit cringey, as is the case throughout the prequel series, but it's still an exciting, interesting movie."
"Mar 08, 2020",5,o melhor filme das prequels
"Mar 05, 2020",3.5,"Definitely the best of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, even though it suffers from bad writing and dialogue. This is the only Star Wars prequel that actually has one moment where the characters show how they feel without just outright saying it and moving along the plot in a lazy and robotic way."
"Mar 04, 2020",3.5,"After finding the stumbling blocks early on, Revenge of the Sith manages to hit plenty of high notes, even if it still insisted on adding in a ton of flips to the lightsaber battles. Pour one out for Plo Koon, boys. (3.5/5)"
"Mar 03, 2020",3.5,"this movie gave life to millions of memes, it's not perfect but still incredibly fun to watch even if it has without any doubts its problems. the final duel on mustafar is to this day the best lightsaber fight ever portrayed on screen."
"Mar 02, 2020",0.5,Bored by lazy over use of lifeless green-screens and the millions of overly long Lightsaber fights and
"Feb 29, 2020",3,"I regret seeing it in a Florida theater with family. Mr. Lucas produced a semi-favorable, action-packed space drama. Samuel Jackson as a chief Jedi were among the best performances, but there was not enough of him. 
    The Revenge of the Sith isn't a fulfilling closure of George Lucas pre-sequel series. I actually wanted to leave mid-way and wait in the lobby for my family to finish enduring it.
    Most of the characters seemed underwritten without knockout performances. The film becomes violent and depressing with scenes that might be too unbelievable for space fantasies, including the birth of Lela and Luke. It became the end of my Star Wars era. I didn't followed up watching the recent Disney sequels."
"Feb 28, 2020",5,Second best star wars movie
"Feb 27, 2020",5,Best of the Prequel Trilogy!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 26, 2020",3.5,"Best of the prequels ... that pretty much sums it up. Still lacking in terms of good writing, but the actings good, the actions good, the plot is great, and the finale is fantastic."
"Feb 24, 2020",5,You'd underestimate its power.
"Feb 22, 2020",4.5,"Revenge of The Sith took what many complained about and fixed it, and gave Star Wars fans a proper ending to the Prequel Trilogy and made the Originals look even better."
"Feb 20, 2020",4,"Say what you want, but I actually enjoyed this one out of the prequels.

The action constant from beginning to end and enough time is spent on storytelling. A lot of the boring council scenes were cut out and the clones weren't portrayed as incompetent buffoons.

Of course, the action is all surface-level as we all know how the original trilogy ends. But that gives us enough reason to turn off our brains and enjoy a good flashy show.

4/5. I debated on a 3.5 but decided to give George Lucas a benefit of a doubt. Doesn't make my all-time favorite list, though."
"Feb 20, 2020",5,"This is definitely my favourite Star Wars movie. There isn't a dull moment, it's action packed with room to breathe and we get to see the fall of a Anakin skywalker. This film is a must see!"
"Feb 20, 2020",0.5,alright bust terrible at the same time
"Feb 20, 2020",0.5,GARBAGEEEEEEEEEEE LIKE EVERY STARWARS MOVIE
"Feb 19, 2020",0.5,"FUCK THIS SHITTY ASS MOVIE, I'M OUT!"
"Feb 18, 2020",4.5,"Even better than the episode 1 and 2 and I liked both those movies.  While at times I felt some of the acting was a little high school drama it didn't take away from the transformation we see in Anakin and how he is easily being pulled to the Darkside.  We see him struggle with Love over Power and lose to power.  In an epic final battle sequence, we watch the Empire and the Sith destroy the Jedi and Rebellion.  Obi-wan and Anakin have one of the best battles in the Star Wars movies and yet at times I still really love the Episode 1 final fight between Qui-gon Jinn and Obi-wan vs Darth Maul.  But not to be left out in episode 3 we see Mace Windu vs Emperor Palpatine in a brilliant battle scene.  And Yet while the jedi battle scenes are far better in these origin story movies all three fall just short of the original trilogy BUT a must watch for any Star Wars fan.  Episodes 1 - 6 are the best watch the new Episodes 7 thru 9 will greatly disappoint and make you hate Disney for killing Stars Wars for every.  A glimmer of Hope with the Solo film and Rogue one, both solid movies with room for growth in the new Solo Franchise."
"Feb 17, 2020",5,"Begining is awesome,middle is still pretty good and the ending is perfect!
And Jesus,the fight coreography is the best from the franchise.
Only problem was Anakin becomming Darth Vader,it was a bit squeezed in..."
"Feb 17, 2020",5,"This movie is amazing, I love it. A thousand times better than the tragedy that is The Last Jedi. If you haven't watched it, please do yourself a favor and watch it."
"Feb 17, 2020",5,"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"
"Feb 16, 2020",4,Finally the prequels are able to reach their full potential on this thrilling conclusion to the prequel trilogy.
"Feb 15, 2020",3.5,"Star Wars Episode III is by far the movie in the Star Wars Saga that has divided the fanbase the most, some think it is good, while others think it is bad, now lets get to my opinion, personally I think its a great movie that is worth rewatching and I would definitely recommend it to others, there are more pros than there are cons, Some of the pros include the Camera work, It is simply amazing, the battle between Anakin and Obi Wan, and near the end where Padme gives birth to Luke and Leia, now lets talk about the cons.. First Of All. the story is overlooked due to the battles and deaths, Order 66, etc, and It also goes on for quite too long, as a conclusion I would give Star Wars Episode III 84/100, It's a great movie worth rewatching, but there are better Star Wars Movies Out There."
"Feb 14, 2020",4,"It still has some of the downfalls of the previous films, but it is definitely a huge step up.  Lots of fun all around, and possibly the best lightsaber battle in the saga."
"Feb 14, 2020",5,"Despite the poor dialogue, this movie makes up for it with some pretty awesome fight scenes. George did a great job to show Star Wars fans how Anakin Skywalker, once a poor slave boy on Tatooine, became the evil Darth Vader. To imagine that a hero like Anakin could become evil in such a short matter of time is amazing and pretty saddening too. The ""You were the Chosen One!"" scene always makes me cry. After watching the Original Trilogy and then this movie it's really sad to think of what Ben Kenobi was thinking when Luke asks ""How did my father die?"". And to top it all off, the wonderful score by John Williams and the LSO. Just a remarkable piece in the Skywalker Saga."
"Feb 13, 2020",5,As the long awaited masterstroke of Lucasarts it is what it is; a worthy explaination of things and in the Star Wars Universe. Solid acting performances and a great story make this film really well worth seeing.
"Feb 13, 2020",3.5,"It's decent. Doesn't make the mistakes that the previous two films make. The writing is not as bad. The lightsaber battles are really entertaining. I love the Order 66 sequence. The negatives for this film include a couple of clunky dialogue moments, bad CGI and Anakin is still annoying. Overall good movie."
"Feb 11, 2020",5,"The hate is silly, this is my favourite star wars movie ever!"
"Feb 08, 2020",2.5,"I don't get people who say it's the best Star Wars movie, ok, ok - maybe it's not that bad but it's not good either."
"Feb 07, 2020",4,"Amazing ending to the prequel trilogy, only bad thing was Christian's acting!"
"Feb 06, 2020",5,Best Star Wars Film!!
"Feb 05, 2020",4.5,"It's not a perfect movie, still has its awkward moments, but it's the best of the Prequels, one of the best in the saga and has one of the if not the greatest Lightsaber fight ever."
"Feb 05, 2020",4,"Known as the good prequel, Revenge of the Sith is a satisfying conclusion to the prequels and offers good action and a decent story. It does take itself a bit too seriously but it makes up for it in not terrible dialogue."
"Feb 04, 2020",4,"The film we've been waiting for! We finally see the transformation of Darth Vader
! The visuals are perfectly balanced with the action and the darkness heightens the fun. Hayden still needed to step up his game though."
"Feb 03, 2020",5, Best Star Wars ever
"Feb 02, 2020",3,"This is an example of the actual story is better than the actors, the director and even the script.
( Sounds a little confusing )"
"Feb 02, 2020",5,"This is truly special to me, as a hardcore Star Wars fan. It is also easily the best of the prequels from a critical perspective and culminates in truly dramatic fashion. The film contains epic battles, terrible tragedy, and offers a satisfying link to the original trilogy (now made even better by Rogue One). It's faults are primarily the weak romance scenes, though there is one great one. This film offers much and considering it's scale, it deserves a watch from most moviegoers."
"Feb 01, 2020",4.5,"The first &amp; best Star wars history!! Really glad of this film, all the film was excellent, true sorrow of the ending but also great joy, a true Star Wars film. The clone wars, the importance of the story, Anakin turn to the dark side, the love story, the epic duels of Lightsabers, the great epic musics of SW universe, the good special effects, greatest characters  &amp; most of all : the Darth Vader's birth! The connection of the original films was so excellent . The prequel trilogy is not perfect but is better than the others SW movies and thanks to Revenge of the Sith! Thank you George Lucas for this films!"
"Jan 31, 2020",4.5,"The best of the three prequels, full of emotion and awesome lightsaber action!"
"Jan 31, 2020",4,"Coming off the disappointment of the first two movies of the Prequel Trilogy Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith feels like a comfortable return to the feel of the Original Trilogy. Of course, ROTS has its flaws, it is still ultimately a prequel movie and it shares many sins with its predecessors, but I would argue that it succeeds much more often than it fails. The story that we had been promised ever since George Lucas put a IV on the title crawl of the original Star Wars was finally being told, the seduction of Anakin Skywalker to the Dark Side and the Rise of the Empire and Darth Vader. Ultimately the parts of this movie that do best deal with these plot points. The Characters and the plot have a major upgrade from the last few films, you care about these characters here. You feel their emotions and conflict. ROTS has some of the most emotional scenes of any Star Wars movie, it was the first one I ever cried at and still consistently gives me the most feelings. It's a beautiful movie and accompanied by what I usually consider to be John William's best work. The action and landscapes are some of the best of the entire series, and the Climactic Duel between Master and Apprentice that is hinted at back in 1977 is a work of art. It is my #1 favorite lightsaber duel of all time, no contest. While there are some scenes that go nowhere and plot points that make me want to tear my hair out. (SHE LOST THE WILL TO LIVE?!?!) Ultimately, I place this movie very high on my list of favorite Star Wars movies, and it deserves every bit of it. -Rhenn"
"Jan 31, 2020",4.5,"Out of the prequels, the best, out of all the Star Wars movies, definitely Top 3 for me. That's controversial definitely and many would disagree but the sheer enjoyment I get out of watching this movie is unrivalled to any other Star Wars movie. This is the film I grew up with, so it'll always have a place in my heart. After watching episode 2, you kind of already know where the films heading but it's such an enjoyable watch. It's leaps in bounds above the previous 2 films in terms of special effects/CGI, a massive improvement and one which definitely benefits the film. Due to the improved visual aspect it holds up compared to modern standards which Episode 1 + 2 fail to do. The thing I loved most about this film is the lightsaber combat, it's significantly better than its predecessors. The choreography is excellent and watching it gives off an amazing sense of enjoyment when watching the Jedi perform these new moves with the lightsaber. This advancement is one I hoped for since it wasn't the greatest in Episode 1 or 2. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan will go down as my favourite character from Star Wars because of this film alone, he's amazing and manages to make what is some poor writing at times seem not as bad. This is a film I will keep coming back to for years to come, whether it's due to it having so many iconic moments, or whether it's to see a action packed film, it'll probably as my favourite Star Wars movie forever"
"Jan 29, 2020",5,"One of my favorite movies. It had amazing lightsaber duels, amazing battles and it is worth watching."
"Jan 28, 2020",4.5,"For some reason, I have always loved this film. Maybe the disappointment from the other prequels made this stand out, but I love this film. With the best fight scenes in the entire franchise, impressive visuals, excellent character arc for Anakin Skywalker, and little focus on complicated stories and characters. This is a great Star Wars film. It feels like A New Hope with its simple story ideas, memorable characters, and dark tone and atmosphere. While some will not like this film, I highly recommend this to all Star Wars fans."
"Jan 27, 2020",4.5,"Revenge of the Sith is my favourite of the Star Wars movies, although I can admit that it is not anywhere near perfect like the first two are. This is mainly because of how blandly many of the lines are delivered, particularly by Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala. Although Hayden Christiansen has been criticized for this, I actually don't mind his performance as Anakin Skywalker. By the end of the movie he became Darth Vader - a cold tyrant who ruled over an entire galaxy with a (literal) iron fist, so I feel as though his emotionless delivery was intentional and brilliant, especially since his emotions only really come out when he's angry and giving into the dark side. Besides, Revenge of the Sith has plenty of action sequences and emotional moments worth an 11/10 that make up for the 7/10 delivery."
"Jan 26, 2020",1.5,It was fine. Cool concept and action I guess. Bad action though. I like the darker tone.
"Jan 23, 2020",5,Best prequel.  And best lightsaber battle ever
"Jan 22, 2020",4,"The third, and final installment to the prequel trilogy is an epic comeback for the franchise. ""Revenge of the Sith"" features more cohesive action sequences and is often poignant enough to overwhelm the once again cringe-worthy romance between Anakin and Padmè. There are many iconic characters brought to life, and the final battle is a spectacle, still not as good as the original, but far better than its two immediate predecessors.

80/100"
"Jan 22, 2020",5,"Amazing, colorful and full of inovation movie that undoubtly gets the high ground on all of star wars trilogies and eventhoigh the dialogue is not that good, it's memeable so 5/5"
"Jan 21, 2020",4.5,The best of the prequels and maybe number two on my favorite Star Wars list after Empire Strikes Back! I'm not too crazy about their choice for Anakin (he's sounds to whiny) and I expected the character to be a more powerful looking man. The story was okay not the direction I would have chosen but it didn't bore me. The action was all that and what I expect for Star Wars. I would have given it five stars but Anakin knocks it down a peg.
"Jan 21, 2020",5,This is the best star wars movie ever &lt;3
"Jan 20, 2020",5,One of my favorite films of all time and by far the best film in the skywalker saga!
"Jan 20, 2020",5,Easily the best Story of any of the Star wars films even if ESB is still better as a film overall!
"Jan 20, 2020",5,"Apart from some cringy dialogue lines given to the actors, Revenge of the Sith caps off the tragic story of Anakin Skywalker and his transition into Darth Vader (his rise and fall).  The film is packed with many of the best action scenes and visuals in ALL of Star Wars.  Hayden Christensen plays Anakin's transition well, and brings us some of the most memorable fights and visuals as a newly transformed Darth Vader.  The soundtrack is as amazing as ever.  Even after watching this film countless times, it manages to remain as a very emotional film, more so than any other Star Wars film, as we witness the fall of the republic and the many characters we loved."
"Jan 19, 2020",5,This is one of the most good examples of a GREAT MOVIE  🎥 A LENGENDARY ONE ☝️. This is one of my favorite one of Star Wars maybe the 2nd one
"Jan 19, 2020",2.5,Only the last hour is good. Still terrible acting and dialogue throughout the movie.
"Jan 19, 2020",3,It was the best of this trilogy :)
"Jan 19, 2020",4,Underrated film. The prequel trilogy is better than the Disney sequel trilogy.
"Jan 18, 2020",5,La venganza de los Siths es una gran película que nos relata el ascenso de los Sith y del imperio
"Jan 18, 2020",2,"The least terrible of the Star Wars prequels, if for no other reason than things happen in it.  Revenge of the Sith still suffers from the same problems as its two predecessors, but it's alleviated somewhat by Ian McDiarmid wonderfully hamming it up as the Emperor.  McDiarmid's performance is, without question, the one saving grace of this trilogy."
"Jan 17, 2020",5,"Hello There,





General Kenobi"
"Jan 16, 2020",3.5,"Pros: I think that this is easily the best out of the prequel trilogy. They fix the dialogue for the most part because there were some lines I didn't like. I think this movie had the best cinematography before the force awakens came out. This movie has the action of any star wars movie. The fast pacing works and the movie never slows down.  I like that Goerge Lucas wasn't afraid to make this movie dark and the dark tone works. I think that Obi-Wan and Yoda are great and the best they have been in the prequel trilogy. I think that they fixed Anakin until the end.  Jar Jar doesn't speak at all. The opening scene was great because it felt like the originals again. I like the rematch against Count Dooku because the choreography was so much better. General Grevious is great and I like the music for General Grievous a lot and the score is the second-best in the entire saga. I like the way that Palpatine is revealed and the way Anakin came to the fark side was well done. I like the mythos that Palpatine tells Anakin. The lightsaber fight was at the best that StarWars besides for one fight. The general Grevious fight is great. Order 66 was handled very well and the emotion hit me when all those Jedi died. The emotion hits you in this movie. I like how Yoda sensed it and killed his stormtroopers and Chewbacca's return was great and I like everything on the Wookie planet.  You could really feel the emotion when Obi-Wan found out Anakin turned to the dark side. The lightsaber fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is the best lightsaber fight in any Starwars movie. You can feel the emotion and this is the best Choreographed fight in all of StarWars. Especially when Obi-Wan lets Anakin burn. The fight between Yoda and Palpatine was great.  This is probably one of the most rewatchable StarWars movies. It is tied with the Return of the Jedi in quality and rewatchabillity. The only good part of the end was Yoda saying Qui Gon Jinn could teach Obi-Wan more about becoming one with the force and the villains winning.

Cons: They didn't fix all the dialogue because there was the occasional bad dialogue and for some reason towards the end some of Hayden Christian's line delivery was awful. The lightsaber fight between for Jedi and Palpatine was pretty bad because three out of four of the Jedi were just standing there. Padme had a horribly acted death and her dying of a broken heart was stupid. Darth Vader in the suit was disappointing because him saying Noooooooooooooo was so bad. The ending was so bad that it takes you of the film. I feel like General  Grievous should have killed a Jedi because he is known as this Jedi killer and he wasn't quite as intimidating and Anakin should have killed more Jedi. I think that they needed just a tiny bit more in this film.

Despite its flaws, the movie is still pretty awesome. This movie is a come back from the last two movies and the best since the original trilogy. This is the most underrated Starwars movie and I think people don't appreciate it because they assume it is like the other two prequel films. This was my favorite Starwars movie as a kid but it is overshadowed by 3 other films.  
It is very entertaining and rewatchable.
This is truly the story that George Lucas wanted to tell and I'm gonna give this movie a (B)"
"Jan 16, 2020",5,Greatest star wars film of all time for me. Loved all of it.
"Jan 15, 2020",4,The best among the prequels
"Jan 15, 2020",3,"This could have been a classic with better casting and less CGI. Hayden C is too fresh faced, too whiney and too boy band, to be the Annakin. Someone else, perhaps a bit older and with a strong presence would have made such a difference to this film. The CGI is very dated and it was shame real locations, real models and real people were not used more. Palpatine was outstanding and the overall story solid (even if Annakin went from good guy to bad guy in one scene, WWE style). If only this were made in the 80s it would have looked better!!"
"Jan 15, 2020",5,the best star wars movie
"Jan 15, 2020",4,Perhaps the the best prequel Star Wars film is Revenge Of The Sith. It will leave you absolutley stunned with its dramatic story and ending.
"Jan 14, 2020",5,Best star wars movie. 
"Jan 14, 2020",5,"emocionante, denso, personagens bem desenvolvidos, lutas de sabre fenomenais."
"Jan 14, 2020",4,"Though there is a lot to criticize in the prequels, RotS is really fun to watch. The sword fights are great though Grievous sword fighting style looks silly.

The end of the movie is amazing. The fights are great, the feels are strong. The dialogues feel natural.

I loved it when I was a kid and still love it today"
"Jan 13, 2020",3.5,"I wish this movie was 20 minutes shorter. There's some stuff in the middle that makes it long winded. The arena fight took too long. However, it was a lot better than the episode II."
"Jan 13, 2020",0.5,"Good grief it just keeps on going as one of the worst decisions to have ever been made by a franchise owner. If Lucas admitted this was made for no other reason besides outright unapologetic greed then I might be willing to accept its existence. 100% of the casting is dead on wrong. It's way too serious. It's a documentary on a total buffoon fumbling about in menace trying to cry his way out of living up to the standards of one of the darkest overlords in cinema. And it completely fails. There isn't a single redeeming second of this insult to the eyes. It even provides a sound clip that was overlaid in the remake of Return of the Jedi that totally trashes the epicness of the final scenes! It absolutely could not have been more damaging to the saga unless it was episode 1 or 2 which are astonishingly WORSE than this one! It would take serious effort for any living director to have made a worse set of prequels. It simply cannot be done except in a dark corner of the twilight zone where the prequels are just a re-release of the holiday special - a torturous blight on cinema I would rather watch a thousand times before admitting these prequels exist. Some day I promise I will hold a funeral service just for Star Wars. All due to the ruin these prequels have done to the saga and the remasterings of the originals. Lucas' failure, like Obi-Wan's is now complete."
"Jan 12, 2020",4,"This film is arguably the best of prequels, and easily top 3 out of the 9 films that make up the Skywalker Saga. Revenge of the Sith carries the spirit of Star Wars quite well. Ewan McGregor was born for his role as Obi Wan Kenobi, and the visuals are still great even 15 years later."
"Jan 12, 2020",5,best star wars movie just awesome plain and simply awesome
"Jan 12, 2020",4.5,"Epic, dark, intense and dramatic, with the story we have been seeing for years, Revenge Of The Sith provides a great closure to the prequels and makes us understand the total arc of Anakin Skywalker's passage to Darth Vader."
"Jan 12, 2020",5,The best of the prequels
"Jan 11, 2020",4,"In the greater context of star wars properties this movie holds up better, than individually as a film. The experienced is greatly enhanced by the Clone wars animated series from 2008-"
"Jan 11, 2020",3.5,No word for it.It is absolutly amazing with some logical mistake!!!
"Jan 09, 2020",5,A great conclusion to a great trilogy I'd say it's better than Empire Strikes Back
"Jan 09, 2020",3.5,The opening battle has that retro Star Wars feel and its dark story is enough to draw you into the movie. Definitely the best of the prequel trilogy and worthy of canon.
"Jan 09, 2020",5,Personal favorite Star Wars movie 
"Jan 09, 2020",4,The best prequel out of the 3. Also has probably the best lightsaber battle of all the Star Wars movies
"Jan 09, 2020",4,The best of the middle trilogy by far. not as good as the first trilogy though. A great transition between the two.
"Jan 08, 2020",5,"Best Star Wars movie ever, evrything is great - story, charaters, visuals and music and finally emotional impact of Anakin's fall to the dark side."
"Jan 08, 2020",5,"This is my favorite of the saga! The problem with this movie is you need to not care or acknowledge certain points of the story, instead just realize the entertainment is already there"
"Jan 08, 2020",3.5,"Listen, Im a big OG star wars fan! and i hate star wars episode 1 and 2, But this movie i actually liked! pretty good acting and action sequences!
i like it 7/10"
"Jan 08, 2020",5,"Muito bom, melancolico, nos mostra com maestria a queda de Anakin Skywalker para o lado sombrio e sua transformação em Darth Vader."
"Jan 07, 2020",5,This is the best Star Wars movie. Change my mind
"Jan 07, 2020",3.5,"While it still suffers from many of the same problems that the other prequels had, it manages to bring some entertainment to the table and was interesting to watch."
"Jan 06, 2020",5,Great clone wars action on Utapu.
"Jan 05, 2020",5,The best of the frisa trilogy
"Jan 05, 2020",5,Greatest Star Wars movie of all time. So emotional and has such a big climax. 
"Jan 05, 2020",4,I have no idea why this movie is hated
"Jan 05, 2020",5,Best Star Wars movie ever. The character arc is just perfect. PREQUELS ARE THE BEST
"Jan 05, 2020",5,"A must see, not perfect but the best of the prequel trilogy. This is WHY we all love the first Trilogy with Luke and Han. This tells the story we all wanted to know for years, just HOW Anakin Skywalker fell from grace to become Darth Vader and how Palpatine took over control of the Republic. Some did not like aspects of the trilogy such as Jar Jar or Hayden's acting, but those are small things IMO. Over all story line and arcs are good."
"Jan 05, 2020",3,great storyline but poor rendition.
"Jan 04, 2020",5,"As someone who sees Star Wars as the story of Anakin Skywalker, this movie gives me everything I want. From the large scale battles if the clone wars to the tragic fall of the chosen one"
"Jan 04, 2020",5,This is the Star Wars we've been waiting in terms of the prequels!  Story ties it altogether 👍
"Jan 04, 2020",5,Absolutely breathtaking movie that everybody must see.
"Jan 04, 2020",4,Excellent ending for the prequel trilogy which brings more meaning to the fall and eventual redemption of Darth Vader.
"Jan 04, 2020",4.5,"One of my favorite SW films, and by far the best SW prequel film."
"Jan 03, 2020",3.5,"7/10. Alas, though George Lucas failed to reach the thrilling heights of his original sci-fi saga, at least he concluded his involvement with Star Wars with a somewhat-redeeming final effort. What elevates this final chapter above other entries in the prequel saga is how it ties together the old and the new; the final act of this film bridges two eras in a bittersweet, narratively plausible way. Watching Anakin's descent into the dark side would have been far more worthwhile had they cast a better actor than Hayden Christensen in the role. Ewan McGregor was good, and Ian McDiarmid puts on a spotlight performance, completing the transformation of suspicious Senator Palatine into the fearsome Darth Sidius. As to be expected, the special effects were jaw-dropping, just as the writing was mediocre at best (and cringe inducing at worst). It is the best movie of the prequels, but still might not stand up with Return of the Jedi, the worst of the original series."
"Jan 02, 2020",0.5,"This movie is just horrible especially when you compare it the actually enjoyable original Star Wars movies. Revenge of the Sith is filled with clunky dialogue, boring and bland characters we're forced to watch for ninety minutes and it just hops from appealing action scene to appealing action scene. All in all this movie has no redeeming qualities about it and you shouldn't waste your time with it."
"Jan 02, 2020",3,"Way better than 1 and at times better than 2, but wow did Hayden Christensen portray Anakin Skywalker as whiney.  Managed to make the ultimate movie villian into a cry baby.  Gotta mostly blame Lucas for this.  I've been watching the Clone Wars animated series and I gotta say that they portray Anakin Skywalker much, much better."
"Jan 02, 2020",5,Best Star Wars movie ever!
"Jan 02, 2020",4.5,Awesome film now I finally figure out where Darth Vader came from the order 66 scene is very shocking when I first saw it.
"Jan 01, 2020",3.5,I like the lightsaber battles
"Jan 01, 2020",5,Best Star Wars movie. Iconic. Perfectly Made. Most quoted movie of all time.
"Jan 01, 2020",5,É um filme fantastico o melhor da segunda trilogia (priquel) e o terceiro melhor filme da saga Star Wars na minha opinião
"Jan 01, 2020",3.5,"In 2005, Star Wars was vastly popular.  This film helped to establish a backstory for several games, books, fan ideas, and other tie-ins.  The film itself is a bit over reliant on CGI, too hammy with the love scenes, has one too many political schemes, and is often disappointing. (like Kit Fisto's death scene!)  But, it being an exercise in world building fantasy, the supplemental material, and being a George Lucas made Star Wars film (which usually means a new interesting technical idea) makes it a little easier to suspend disbelief."
"Dec 31, 2019",4,"Good Stuff: Feel's a lot like an OT star wars movie, The long take beginning, The lightsaber duels, The action, the music, the casting, another really good ending.

Bad Stuff: Anakin's dark side fall feels slightly rushed, and again Yoda isn't used very well, and neither is grevious. ( A good example of both of these characters used well is clonewars)"
"Dec 31, 2019",4.5,"Awesome! Fun story, great visuals and the freakin birth of Lord Vader."
"Dec 31, 2019",5,Amazing I love this film &lt;3
"Dec 31, 2019",4.5,"One of the best star wars movies and always enjoyable to watch. Some people will never forgive the prequels, but this one tones down the cringey love dialogue (though I concede it still can hurt once in a while) and other campy features. I never get bored with this one"
"Dec 31, 2019",5,This is when Star Wars was good
"Dec 31, 2019",5,The best of the 3 prequels for sure....watching Anakin give in to the dark side is heartbreaking even though you know it's coming and it has been coming for three movies.
"Dec 31, 2019",4,"Yes, the prequels are still shit but Revenge of the Sith is probably the most emotional and heart-breaking movie of the entire saga. Everyone knows Anakin will become Darth Vader yet it's still extremely thrilling to watch. Largely due to incredible performances by Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid and the ever so moving soundtrack of John Williams."
"Dec 30, 2019",4,"Revenge of the Sith was the incredible culmination of two medium films with slow development. Even though we know the outcome of the story, viewers and left heart-broken to see the fall of the Jedi Order and the ascension of Darth Vader. Unlike its predecessors, the movie is exhilarating. Lightsaber fights and combat scenes were amazing. Hayden's Christensen acting even got [a little] better. By the end, you understand that it was the prequels have long been thought of by their creator, who unfortunately should have surrounded himself better to write and direct these films."
"Dec 30, 2019",5,GREAT FILM GEORGE LUCAS
"Dec 30, 2019",5,Incredible movie. I grew up with this film and love the answers to all questions as to how everyone falls into their respective places in Star Wars A New Hope.
"Dec 30, 2019",4.5,Best of prequels and right up there with all the originals.
"Dec 30, 2019",5,Best of the prequels. Despite wooden dialogue the movie is fairly solid.
"Dec 30, 2019",2.5,"Truly the best of the bad Star Wars movies, Revenge of the Sith doesn't make a whole lot of sense, both when viewed as self-contained, and when seen as a part of the Star Wars whole, but at least Lucas bothered to put a whole movie in here."
"Dec 30, 2019",4,"Es Una Película Larga Pero Tiene Muchas Escenas De Acción Con Sables De Luz Que Son Excelentes, La Trama Es Muy Buena Y Ágil Pero Si No Eres Fanático Posiblemente Tengas Escenas Aburridas, Los Personajes Son Excelentes Junto Con Los Efectos Especiales"
"Dec 29, 2019",3.5,"I thought it was good, it sometimes was a bit boring, but most of the time you were very exited to find out what happens next."
"Dec 29, 2019",5,Best star wars movie to date. Very dark and doesn't hold back. Captures the fall of the jedi very well and the rise of darkness in the galaxy. The relationship between Obi  Wan and Anakin is very well done and the casting choice is amazing. The dialogue could use some work but for the rest a classic wonderful movie.
"Dec 29, 2019",5,Ian Mcdiarmid and Ewan Mcgregor help redeem this movie with its incredible acting. Lightsaber duels in this movie are fantastic
"Dec 29, 2019",5,Emocionalmente intensa. La mejor de toda la saga.
"Dec 29, 2019",5,This movie is an absolute blast. It basically says who cares let's just have fun. It is action packed and the best Star Wars movie of them all.
"Dec 28, 2019",5,"Best Star Wars Movie.
Dark. Cool. Sad."
"Dec 28, 2019",4,Revenge of the Sith brings this convoluted era of Star Wars to an emotionally satisfying conclusion.
"Dec 28, 2019",5,"The best Star Wars movie since 1980, and even better than the new ones."
"Dec 28, 2019",4.5,"It's disappointing to see the audience score at 66% for this film. This is not only the best of the prequels but one of the best in the entire series. Putting the cheesy love story to one side, the rest of the film is fantastic! The story is suitably dark the light sabre action is great. We see the transformation of Anakin, The end of Dooku and Windu and the emergence of Palpatine. What more could you want? I admit that when the prequels first hit the big screen I wasn't sure how I felt about them because nothing could top the original trilogy for me but as the years tick by and after watching Disney's trilogy I appreciate just how good George Lucas is at developing a story. I so wish he kept the rights to Starwars and produced episodes 7/8/9."
"Dec 28, 2019",4.5,"Honestly, amazing. One or two dumb things, like including Chewbacca working with Yoda. But an amazing way to end the trilogy and bring everything together"
"Dec 28, 2019",4,By far the best out of the prequels it was fun and exciting and I thought it was very cool seeing the making of earth Vader and personally the best appearances of obi wan and yoda.
"Dec 28, 2019",3,To me still meh. But compared to the others before it.....this is amazing. After having to rewatch the phantom menace and attack of the clones .....this seemed like such a good movie....until compared to the others. But just because it went away from the rest of the movie a little...eh....I will give it at least 3 stars.
"Dec 28, 2019",4.5,"Other than the Lucas's dialogue which ended Christianson's career, a solid Star Wars film"
"Dec 27, 2019",5,"Great movie, closes the chapter on Vader's origin"
"Dec 27, 2019",5,Arguably the best movie in the saga and one of the best movies of this decade
"Dec 27, 2019",4,great action sequences! no jar jar lines! mace windu is not lame this time!
"Dec 27, 2019",4,"The best of the prequel trilogy. Anikan and Obi-Wan's relationship is the best part of this movie, and Palpatine is an absolute standout. It has without a doubt the best lightsaber action of all the Star Wars films, and it impressively ties the original trilogy and prequel trilogy together. Dialog and over-use of CGI might be the only issues this film has. This film saved the prequel trilogy in my opinion."
"Dec 27, 2019",5,"After watching Disney rubbish movie. This is really a damm good movie. At least the lightsaber fight was damn good. At least the story make sense. At least Obiwan was really convincing. At least the space fight is really good. At least the storm trooper die. At least Anikin Skywalker can be defeated. At least Jedi(s) are powerful but they still die. And all Jedi(s) has their strength and weakness, they each have different roles and is very clearly shown in the movie. Disney's Star Wars is... plotless, illogical, breaks all physics, no continuity from previous 6 movies (plus Rogue One). No idea why Rey Space Jesus was ever needed to go through 3 movies when she could single handedly just destroy the entire Universe in the first 5 mins of the film. She can literally do anything. Teleport, heal people, bring dead people back to life, do Jedi mind trick, lift entire mountain range basically just do everything and anything she wants. Disney Star Wars is... just wasting people's time, it's rubbish. Its not inspiring and its almost just illogical (poor) action. Even the action sequence is BAD... REALLY BAD. I give George Lucas  STAR WARS 10 out of 5 stars. For being logical, consistent and good fight sequence."
"Dec 27, 2019",5,"Lots of saber duels, lots more of action and nicely rounded off Anakin's turn to Vader"
"Dec 27, 2019",5,"Superb! Outstanding! Mind-blowing! Epic! 
I ♥️ Star Wars ♥️"
"Dec 26, 2019",5,This movie has a perfect mix of emotional and thrilling moments and it has everything you want to see in Star Wars film. My personal favorite Star Wars movie.
"Dec 26, 2019",4,"Though it was sometimes a bit bland, ROTS is the greatest prequel, and I enjoyed the vast battle scenes, seeing order 66 play out was tragic, and it only continues to wrench the hearts of viewers of the clone wars."
"Dec 26, 2019",4,"In my opinion this is the best Star Wars movie, and not by a slim margin."
"Dec 26, 2019",5,"An amazing, thrilling movie full of stunning action and dazzling visuals. One of the best Star Wars movies."
"Dec 26, 2019",5,Love this movie so much
"Dec 26, 2019",4.5,"Terrible Script, but the best memes and Lightsaber choreography came from this movie."
"Dec 26, 2019",3.5,"Intriguing, perhaps slightly so, climax to the Anakin Skywalker fall from grace from the ""light side"" to the ""dark side"" (or falling into his shadow side and it takes over him). Sometimes a bit weak, but an emotional ending to the trilogy."
"Dec 26, 2019",3.5,"The best episode in the prequel series by far in which it seems that George has taken all the criticism levied against the previous films and rectified them in this entry. From the action to the music to even the story, the film improves on every aspect of the previous entries and quite wonderfully concludes the trilogy which fits in smoothly into the original films. This is what star wars is about"
"Dec 26, 2019",4,Best of the new trilogy 
"Dec 26, 2019",5,"This is my second favourite Star Wars film. It is just perfect in anyway, but I still like New Hope more"
"Dec 25, 2019",5,"Really good,amazing movie."
"Dec 25, 2019",3.5,It was good and I loved the plot and suspense of the movie best of the prequels
"Dec 25, 2019",5,"Apart from The Phantom Menace, this had the best Lightsaber battle. A great ending to a great trilogy. Bittersweet to be sure."
"Dec 25, 2019",4,Good round of to the prequels. Obi Wan vs Vader. Yoda vs Sidious. Windy death. Really good movie.
"Dec 25, 2019",5,"I guess this review might be a bit biased since i prefer recent movies to old ones  and that I was really young when I watched it, but no matter what, the plot of this movie is absolutely out of this world. I loved the lightsaber duels and all the action sequences. I never really care much for acting, so I didn't really have a problem with it. But it never lets you get bored. Palpatine and the clone wars is what I love from the movie the  best, but there are too many thing to like about it and that's why it gets the all-out rating from me."
"Dec 25, 2019",4,"It's Darth Vader's origin, the moment he falls to the dark side an important event in a movie that has it problems but shows how change befell the galaxy far far away. I like it especially Kenobis shines bright in the prequel triology and Hayden really brings it home after a rocky start in the triology."
"Dec 25, 2019",2.5,"It's a storyline that follows a weak one from its predecessor. Coupled with a horrible ending, this movie disappoints. Ewan McGregor is stellar and some lightsaber scenes are cool. But prepare for an arsenal of disappointments, i.e., Yoda, Padme, Anakin, Mace Windu, Darth Sidious, and finally Darth Vader - all major disappointments."
"Dec 25, 2019",4,4/5... best of prequel triology
"Dec 25, 2019",5,Best Star Wars movie!
"Dec 24, 2019",4.5,"The best of the prequel trilogy by far. However, it is still cheesy at times. I feel this is okay, because what Star Wars movie isn't, and because it can be looked past if someone knows it coming."
"Dec 24, 2019",5,best of the prequels 
"Dec 24, 2019",5,One of the best Star Wars Movies I have ever seen.
"Dec 24, 2019",3.5,"The best in the trilogy with some great lightsaber duels, unfortunately this one still feels a little flat"
"Dec 24, 2019",5,"Everythings was absolutely superb - cinematography, lighting and sound were all the best. The plot was fantastic and provided a wonderful climax to the prequels."
"Dec 24, 2019",4.5,"The story of Palpatine becoming Emperor and the formation of the Empire, the Fall of the Jedi, and the rise of Darth Vader.  It answers many of the questions that the original trilogy created!"
"Dec 23, 2019",5,Best one in Star Wars history
"Dec 23, 2019",5,Best star wars movie!!!
"Dec 23, 2019",5,One of the best star wars films
"Dec 23, 2019",4,"Cheesy love story built in but a fantastic look into Anikan and his frustrations. However, potentially the worst 10 seconds in any movie ever to close the trilogy. "
"Dec 23, 2019",3.5,"The only prequel I can tolerate, but its actually pretty good too. Better than anything Disney is trying to do with star wars."
"Dec 23, 2019",4,"Overall, the best movie in the prequel trilogy. An amazing movie for the Star Wars franchise that manages to rise above the other two prequels. The story is very rich, and it sets the stage for A New Hope (technically Rogue One)."
"Dec 23, 2019",5,"Best movie of the saga! Action all the way. We can really see why Anakin went to the dark side, and it is thrilling. Palpatine the best villain of all time."
"Dec 23, 2019",5,I can describe this movie with a single word flawless
"Dec 23, 2019",4,"The dialogue is painfully bad at times, but this is a kinetic, fast-paced, and gleefully bombastic space adventure with some genuinely dark scenes."
"Dec 23, 2019",5,"I don't know how that's possible, but after two terrible prequels, George Lucas delivered the franchise's best film since episode five. Graphics have reached a level where you stop being distracted by it, editors have gone into a break with the effects of PowerPoint on a large scale, the intensity of passions does not let go until the very end, and Hayden Christensen suddenly learned to act. Revealed chic secondary characters, enough attention was paid to the most interesting antagonist of the franchise Darth Sidious, the choreography of battle scenes has become even more spectacular. I don't think we deserved such a good movie, especially from old Lucas."
"Dec 23, 2019",5,It's the epic climax of the saga that complete star wars in the best trilogy ending possible.
"Dec 23, 2019",4,Best of the Prequels! only Empire from Original does better!
"Dec 23, 2019",4,This was definitely the best of the prequel trilogy despite the corny Nooooooooooo at the end.
"Dec 22, 2019",3.5,"What many people consider to be the best of the prequel trilogy, this conclusion shows us the great action once again with surprisingly good acting from Hayden Christensen, Ewan Mcgregor and Ian McDiarmid as well as memorable fight sequences from the beginning battle on Coruscant to the final battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin on Mustafar. Defiantly the best out of the prequel trilogy~"
"Dec 22, 2019",5,"the best part of the whole series, if you don't think so you ain't a star wars fan"
"Dec 22, 2019",5,"The best movie in the entire Star Wars universe. Hands down. If you don't like this movie, you probably just don't like George Lucas/Star Wars"
"Dec 22, 2019",1.5,"Could be good story. Too much poor animations, influence to everything, wont fit to atmosphere. Settings are unconvicing. Characters... coughing droid.."
"Dec 22, 2019",5,"THE TRULY BEST EPISODE OF THE STAR WARS SAGA. Majestic, epic, tragic, poetic, romantic, sad, POWEFULL."
"Dec 22, 2019",5,one of the best star wars movies and the most underrated
"Dec 22, 2019",5,"There is nothing about this movie not to love!  The story, the acting, the soundtrack!  It's all wonderful!  Bunch that in with the tie in novelsy (EU novels of course) and it's an unmatched experience as the rest of the true Star Wars saga (1-6) is :)

Nothing short of a full recommendation from me!"
"Dec 22, 2019",5,"The dialogue could use some touching up, but the plot and acting are fantastic. An absolute must see"
"Dec 22, 2019",4.5,"Great movie, definitely the best one out of the prequels in my opinion. The movie has a good pace and the visuals are spectacular. All the actors and actresses are great in this film, I personally loved this movie"
"Dec 22, 2019",5,Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?
"Dec 22, 2019",5,Absolutely stunning. A truly emotional end to the prequel trilogy and possibly the perfect movie.
"Dec 22, 2019",5,Best episode of  the prélogy
"Dec 22, 2019",4,Best Star Wars Episode
"Dec 22, 2019",5,My favourite film of the prequels. It's full of the best lightsaber battles and emotion to the transformation of lord vader. Astonishingly good
"Dec 22, 2019",4,fantastic. if you love star wars you will enjoy this.
"Dec 22, 2019",5,"Best movie from the prequel, a great climax and the greatest soundtrack that John Williams could have made"
"Dec 22, 2019",5,Revenge of the sith brings fresh elements to the Star Wars mythology that had not been nor in the others prequels or the original trilogy. Also it feels satisfactorily connected to them.
"Dec 22, 2019",2.5,Great elements but Hayden Christianson. Nuff said.
"Dec 22, 2019",3.5,"This movie gives me mixed feelings. First getting into the positive things and elements that keep bringing me back to this movie; The opening scene immediately draws you in with action and suspense that the other two prequel installments failed to do. The acting performances are immediately a step up from the previous two movies, but still are sometimes stiff. The light saber duels and choreography are really fun to watch and pull you in. This movie however, is brought down by its blatant flaws. The romance between Anakin and Padme is stiff and flat out cringe. The way that the plot moves feels out of nowhere and rushed. This is by far the best prequel but still has its flaws that bring it down from the Star Wars name."
"Dec 22, 2019",2.5,"Has some cool moments, but is still really a pile of Sith."
"Dec 21, 2019",5,Top 3-4 in the saga!! The best lightsaber duel
"Dec 21, 2019",5,"I love this, it's my all time favorite Star Wars movie. It doesn't have this political discussions and the edgy love story like in the 2 before. Last but not least, the transformation from Anakin into Vader was just sad and epic."
"Dec 21, 2019",4,"Star Wars Episode III is one of the best films of the prequel trilogy. I am so happy that George Lucas had done something right with this film. I love the actions sequences, the key dialogue like the Opera House scene, and the dark tone of what would eventually be the rise of the Galactic Empire. Although there are some missteps like some parts of the screenplay and Hayden Christensen's overacted performance. Overall, Star Wars III finally put the previous prequel films in shame."
"Dec 21, 2019",5,"Best star wars movie! Extremely thrilling, action-packed &amp; nostalgic! A must for every star wars fan"
"Dec 21, 2019",5,This is my favorite Star Wars movie ever!
"Dec 21, 2019",5,Obi wan Kenobi plz respond to my DMs
"Dec 21, 2019",3,"An ok ending to a mediocre trilogy. Great visuals, some thoughtful moments, lots of plot holes, and a wonderful score."
"Dec 21, 2019",5,"I loved this movie, I thought it explains things well."
"Dec 21, 2019",4,The conflict between Anakin and Obi-wan is one that can't be missed.
"Dec 21, 2019",5,Best of the whole franchise... the high ground of film
"Dec 21, 2019",3.5,"Considering the general awfulness of the first two prequel STAR WARS films, THE REVENGE OF THE SITH is deeply satisfying. It's formulaic and    cheesy - not to mention incredibly dark at times -  but has the most riveting, emotional ending out of all the STAR WARS movies."
"Dec 21, 2019",3.5,Iconic. Some of Star Wars' best mixed with it's worst.
"Dec 21, 2019",5,My favorite prequel 
"Dec 21, 2019",5,"Fantastic, tragic ending to the prequel trilogy."
"Dec 21, 2019",5,"As  The conclusion of the biggest WAR in the Star Wars series; it mirrors other historical moments; the Fall of the Roman Republic through Ronald Syme's point of view.  So yeah I'm a snob and I think this was the best of all 9 Star Wars movies. For one, its ALL ACTION.  The amount of Star Warfare is mindboggling.  The best lightsaber duels are in this one. Yoda vs Palpatine for crissakes.   The effects were amazing.   Capital Ship to Capital Ship broadsides.  Star Fighters and Capital ships. 
    The story of the fall of a Republic, through victorious War, is soooo common in human history. Napoleon and Augustus are the most famous; It could have happened in USA so many times, but an army indoctrinated in freedom, who always held elections in wartime even under the most cataclysmic eras, is doubtful to follow orders on the suspension of elections."
"Dec 21, 2019",4,4 stars just for the last 3 mins of the movie
"Dec 21, 2019",5,My favorite Star Wars film
"Dec 21, 2019",5,Best movie in the skywalker saga. Perfect ending to the trilogy. 1-6 and rogue one were good movies.
"Dec 21, 2019",4.5,"Its not the best Star wars movie, but I liked it."
"Dec 21, 2019",5,One of the Best Star Wars movies in entire franchise definitely. I can watch it several times and never get bored.
"Dec 21, 2019",5,Revenge of the Sith is a classic! This movie is definitely worth the watch.
"Dec 21, 2019",4,a bit to much emo in the end with the death of padme and the switch of anakin could have been done better. Loved the creation of VADER
"Dec 21, 2019",4.5,Such an amazing and emotionally thrilling film. I felt the actors did a brilliant job in portraying their given characters and overall I believe this is one of the best Star Wars films ever!
"Dec 21, 2019",5,Best Star Wars movie made.
"Dec 21, 2019",4,A great revival from the last 2 prequels. The pacing is steady and very engaging.
"Dec 21, 2019",5,Best Star Wars movie
"Dec 21, 2019",3,Not that good but would watch it again in the background.
"Dec 21, 2019",5,Best movie of the prequels. Ewan McGregor as Obi wan is fantastic.
"Dec 21, 2019",5,Best star wars movie!
"Dec 21, 2019",5,Just the best Star Wars film oat innit
"Dec 21, 2019",5,favourite star wars movie of all time. period.
"Dec 20, 2019",4.5,"This is not one of the Originals, but it is a great film. While it certainly lacks in some aspects, the action and story of Anakin's fall is an engaging and tumultuous one. The fight scenes are superb, best in the franchise, and the tensions ring high even when you know the outcome due to the Originals. A must-see for Star Wars fans."
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,"Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will"
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"I grew up with the prequels so this film is an absolute favorite of mine. The continuously battles and intense moments of the movie keeps your eyes glued to the screen at all times. The transforming of Anakin Skywalker turning into Darth Vader shows why he turned to the dark side and at moments you have empathy for him. Emperor Palpatine is the manipulator mastermind and you can feel it. The plot of the film is always at a turning point and while most know the ending, it is still stunning to see on screen. General Grievous is one of the coolest Star Wars characters of all time and his battles with Obi-Wan were great to see. The ending is emotional, intense, and makes you want to be in the Star Wars Universe."
"Dec 20, 2019",1,"Growing up with the original trilogy, and watching this trilogy was a resounding disappointment. This was the beginning of the downfall of Lucas. The special effects looked bubbly and cartoonish. It completely lacked the feel of the original movies. The vehicles looked more advanced/elegant that the original movies, and that doesn't make any sense because they were prequels. The acting was some of the worst I'd ever seen in a major motion picture. Surely technology advanced. The one saving grace for this trilogy was the incredible acting for the famous character Obi-Wan. Sam Neeson was incredible throughout.

The last of the trilogy was the best by far, and this is in no small part to two things; Jar Jar Binks saw less screen time, and the film started to feel dark and gritty around the edges - finally."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,One of my favourites
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Though it isn't the best of them. It is definitely the most fun watching.
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,A great ending to the prequels
"Dec 20, 2019",5,The BEST...Simply a masterpiece in the 2000s era
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Epic final for the prequels
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Best Star Wars movie ever created.
"Dec 20, 2019",5,My favourite movie of all time
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Best Star Wars Movie Ever
"Dec 20, 2019",4.5,"One of the best Star Wars films. My favorite one. Seeing Anakin be persuaded by the Dark Side was well done. Order 66 was an emotional scene. From the get go we knew the Jedi would lose, but they way they should was still shocking and gut griping. The fight scene between Anakin and Obi Wan was devastating and emotional."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"One of my favourite Star Wars movies. A fine conclusion to the prequel trilogy, that its share of good &amp; bad moments up to this point. Great cinematography, great action, emotional plot. Thank you George for finishing the new trilogy on a high note."
"Dec 20, 2019",4.5,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa nostaliga
"Dec 20, 2019",4,"Well, finally, a good game of actors ...... A game of actors?"
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"Easily the best movie in the Saga. Anakin's fall is tragic and makes you want to cry. The dynamic between Anakin and Obi wan is amazing and heartbreaking to see them fall apart in the end. By far the best lightsaber duel in the entire saga. The music, again, is the best in the saga and very memorable."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,this is by far the 2nd best movie in the trilogy...7 light saber battles. What is not to like.
"Dec 20, 2019",4.5,So good!!! Hayden Christiansen 🥰
"Dec 20, 2019",4.5,"While some may be dissatisfied, this movie provides emotional, action-packed sequences that are unforgettable and make the rise of Darth Vader live up to what it deserves to be. While sad and devastating, it is one of the highlights of my childhood."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,The best that Star Wars has to offer!
"Dec 20, 2019",5,A Well written and directed prequel! A few things could of been better but overall just a great movie
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Best movie of all time.
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"Best prequel, the fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is amazing"
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,I think this is the best movie of the trilogy and the end lightsaber fight was incredible
"Dec 20, 2019",1.5,This is my personal least favorite star wars movie because of its horrible explanations for just about everything except the emperor resulting in plot holes in the original trilogy that didn't even used to exist
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"This movie ROCKS. Anakin becomes the evil Darth Vader. I don't even need to say anymore. As good as the original, in my opinion."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Perfection. Wouldnt change a thing.
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Best of the prequels
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Great movie with a lot of action. Its a very dark and emotional movie. The lightsaber battles are great. I love everything about this movie and its my favorite Star Wars movie.
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Loved almost all of it.
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,"Anakin vs. Obi Wan, Order 66, That opening... Do I need to say anyting else?"
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,"Frequently called the best of the prequels, it earns that title gracefully.
Here, George Lucas has finally decided to put some effort into his direction. And the results are powerful. While Attack of the Clones forced you to focus on it's poor writing, Revenge of the Sith's utterly gorgeous visuals distract from any nagging logical questions.

Anakin vs Obi-Wan. The birth of Darth Vader, Luke and Leia. The death of the Republic, the rise of The Empire. All these moments happen so fast and in sequence... and yet they still resonate powerfully. 

George still obviously has trouble directing actors, but the level of talent on display here is impressive. Hayden Christianson unfairly was criticized for his performance, but time has validated him- and this film."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,My favorite Star Wars film.
"Dec 20, 2019",4,"Great opening, great finale, the middle varies in quality but the when action, score and special effects all come together the film becomes one of the greatest sci fi movies of all time"
"Dec 20, 2019",2.5,"I liked the third act, that's it. There are many boss battles, it feels like a video game going from battle to battle."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,It my most favorite movie ever made and I love it especially the opening fight scene and the battle of mustafar
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Perfect ending to the Star Wars Saga.
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"Probably viewed as the best movie out of the prequel saga, and personally my second favorite out of the prequels and original trilogy. Dark, lots of action, and a good conclusion to the prequels."
"Dec 20, 2019",4.5,"Revenge of the Sith was a really good movie. A dark plot, Obi-Wan's famous line, and a great story that concludes the Prequel Trilogy."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"A masterpiece. This movie is definitely the strongest instalment of the entire Star Wars saga. It ties every movie so stunningly with a completely hole-less plot. The emotion brought in during the mustafar duel makes for a beautiful ending, and in my opinion, is the best Star Wars duel. It truly shows what two jedi in their peak look like when fighting for their life."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"It was as one of the best prequel movies, showing Anakin's shift to become Vader and it portrayed well how quickly the Galactic Empire rise to power. It ties the prequels right into the original trilogy and later into Rogue One and Solo. It showed the emotional struggle of Anakin as he was pulled to the dark under the influence of Darth Sidious (Sheev Plapatine.) The movie also showed the conclusion of the Clone Wars and the corruption and imbalance of the Jedi. It featured some very emotional and deep scenes as well as amazing lightsaber duels. The movie had a beautiful opening scene that instantly immerses you into the initial space battle over Coruscant. It is one of my all time favorites."
"Dec 19, 2019",4.5,This film always gets me emotional. It gets too much hate but this film is beautifully done.
"Dec 19, 2019",4.5,Probably an unpopular opinion but Revenge of the Sith is in my top 3 favorite movies from the Star Wars saga.
"Dec 19, 2019",5,Best installment of the best Star Wars trilogy.
"Dec 19, 2019",3,The best of the prequels.
"Dec 19, 2019",4,"The best of the prequel films. It's pacing is very fast, considering where we start of and where we finish after two hours. The film demonstrates why we should have really gotten more of this, particularly the character interactions between Anakin and Obi-Wan throughout the previous two installments that would have made for a far better storytelling experience. But as it stands, this film manages to tie together the prequel and original trilogies in a neat bow."
"Dec 19, 2019",5,Grew up with it. I love it
"Dec 19, 2019",5,"Brilliant end to the trilogy. Dialogue can be rough at times, although the emotional weight carries the movie throughout. Revenge of the sith is pure star wars from start to finish"
"Dec 19, 2019",5,Best Star Wars movie ever.
"Dec 19, 2019",5,Awesome story that properly transitions the golden days of the republic into the Evil Galactic Empire.
"Dec 19, 2019",5,My favorite of the entire saga!
"Dec 19, 2019",5,The best prequel. A great ending to Anakins story.
"Dec 19, 2019",2,"Poor acting, terrible dialogue. Why did they decide politics was the missing part to the saga. George Lucas can't do this shit by himself, he needs to be pulled up and told he's wrong. And why was their a chain of people from the emperor to stupid robot worms trying to kill padme"
"Dec 19, 2019",5,"Impressive the best movie in the Star wars saga, and the best for me in the history of cinema."
"Dec 19, 2019",5,"The best movie in the saga, no comparison!"
"Dec 19, 2019",5,"Mi película favorita de todas (solo por un poco por encima del episodio 5), desde el día de su estreno no he podido dejar de verla"
"Dec 19, 2019",5,"I loved this film, laser fights were fantastic!"
"Dec 19, 2019",4,Clearly the best film of the Prequel trilogy. I enjoyed most all the interactions between Anakin and Palpatine.
"Dec 18, 2019",4,"Apart from some non sense dialog and screenplay, This movie is jam packed with action and emotion. It made me cheer, cry, and laugh. Overall dark and a good lead up to a New Hope."
"Dec 18, 2019",4,Revenge Of The Sith is very good. It is definitely the best in the prequel trilogy. But not only that it is one of the best in the Saga! it has a pretty good story and yes Hayden Christenson still can't act but it is still good. And that last lightsaber fight is probably the best in the Saga.
"Dec 18, 2019",4.5,Can we please get more Anakin and Obi-wan?
"Dec 18, 2019",3.5,"The best of the prequel trilogy. If that is saying much. This movie had a huge potential and it almost fulfills it with finesse and perfection. The visual effect are stunning again, that lightsaber battle is still the best we've seen on the big screen, but this time it is combined with a broodingly epic atmosphere of impending doom leading to a satisfying end.
 
It has an issue with overexplanation and shows us some things that I firmly believe we did not need to see. But Lucas closed it off nicely enough. Overall a worthy addition to the Star Wars franchise."
"Dec 18, 2019",4,"The most underated Star Wars movie ! top 3 star wars movie, no doubts"
"Dec 18, 2019",5,Лучшая часть киновселенной!
"Dec 18, 2019",5,"When I first watched, and over viewing it again, I think the same thing: this movie excites me, it gets me caring about what happens (even though, even in the first watch, I pretty much knew what would happen). For me, that's very rare in a movie that isn't drama. I usually don't expect much from sci-fi magic movies, it's not really my thing, but after this movie I went and learnt more about Star Wars, which I wouldn't probably have done without this movie and how it made me care, in this genre which isn't usually my thing. I don't think it adds much to the original trilogy, or to the two previous movies, I think it's a movie you can watch on its own."
"Dec 18, 2019",3.5,"This is my fourth favorite Star Wars film, being Empire, Force Awakens, and Return of the Jedi. 

Unlike Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, most of the effects in this film still hold up, which is saying something for a 15-year-old movie. 

There are many elements in this film that make it one of the better Star Wars films despite some bad dialogue. All of the duels in this film are amazing, the battle scene that starts the film is one of the best ways any Star Wars film opens, Ewan McGregor nails the role of Obi-Wan, and it does a good job of wrapping up the trilogy and showing how Anakin became Vader.

My Review: B+"
"Dec 18, 2019",5,Continues to get better over time. Belongs in everybody's top half of star wars films.
"Dec 18, 2019",4.5,Some dialogue could be fixed but a great end the the prequel trilogy. Iconic moments in this movie.
"Dec 18, 2019",4.5,"A unique movie that creates a classic tragedy within itself. Dialogue in the movie could've been better. The movie is dark compared to any other Star Wars movies, the more you analyze the movie the more dark you realize it is. A dark premise is what was expected as we knew George Lucas was making these prequels to explain the story of how Darth Vader came to be."
"Dec 17, 2019",4.5,4th revenge of the sith 3rd best a new hope 2nd return of the jedi 1st the empire strikes back
"Dec 17, 2019",4,Definitely best of the prequel trilogy.
"Dec 17, 2019",4.5,Precuels Best! Anakin vs ObiWan
"Dec 17, 2019",4.5,Star Wars Revenge Of The Sith was an fun epic trilogy to the skywalker saga. Get your tissues ready.
"Dec 17, 2019",5,"I loved this movie, it was by far the darkest Star Wars movie"
"Dec 16, 2019",4,"The relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan is the crown jewel of this film. A tragic story, we all already know how it ends, and yet still very moving performances. 

Some over the top moments that come off as cheesy, but still gotta give it a high score. Visually beautiful. Though these first 3 are quite complicated plats, this one is the simplest excellent telling of the fall of Anakin Skywalker. 

Also, in comparison to episodes 7-9, this along with episode I, are way under appreciated. Episode II is still kinda horrible with bad villains and terrible dialogue."
"Dec 16, 2019",3.5,"Ok, George Lucas finally got over the hump with this one. Much better than Episodes 1 and 2. I still hate Anakin but I appreciate the clone wars TV show showing us what he could have been like so I'll get over it. Lightsaber scenes are by far the best part. Better CGI but still has a long way to go."
"Dec 15, 2019",1.5,"Darth Vader was a bad ass, this makes him seem like an Emo kid."
"Dec 15, 2019",5,the second best star wars movie
"Dec 15, 2019",5,Second best star wars movies ever.
"Dec 15, 2019",5,absolutely bloody amazing
"Dec 15, 2019",4,"I think this is the best movie of George Lucas's newer trilogy.  I find the transformation of Anakin Skywalker to the evil and infamous Darth Vader to be remarkable.  The scene where he loses his legs and burns up from lava is the most poignant moment of the whole movie.  I enjoyed the Hayden Christensen's performance as the brooding Jedi gone Sith.  Ewan McGregor was a perfect choice to play the young Obi Wan.  I can't help but feel that Natalie Portman was an annoying light weight in this, and that Samuel Jackson was so out of place that it was absurd.  The character of Yoda could have been done much better.  The production of Yoda frankly just stunk compared to the puppetry of the character in Lucas's first series.  It could have brought this movie to a new level if that character had been produced better.  One might say that this was all overly computerized.  Stylistically, I think it could have been a great deal better to blend the style of the original classic films with these new ones so that the six movies flow more believably together.   This is the only one of the three George Lucas new trilogy movies that I'll watch.  I just purchased this on iTunes for $9.99.  A bargain IMO.  I'm glad to have it in my collection and I'm sure that I'll revisit it again some day.  Not a perfect masterpiece, but it does justice to the story of Luke Skywalker's father turned to the dark side."
"Dec 15, 2019",4.5,the best of the saga
"Dec 14, 2019",1,"This depiction almost destroys an otherwise perfectly fine storyline. If mediocrity was the goal, it is a shining follow-up to the horrible ""Phantom Menace"". I have no idea where most of the critics' heads were at when they gave these two movies higher marks than ""Attack of the Clones"", but I can guess. There are some great effects and scenery in all three prequels, but the acting, dialogue, and worse yet, delivery of the dialogue in the prequels gags me. They would be just GREAT if they'd been made in the 1950's, because that's what they sound like. But the absolute WORST thing about this movie is the burning ""birth"" of Darth Vader. The fight scene over the lava looks like it came from an early '70's made-for-TV movie, or worse, a mid-1990's SCI-FI Channel movie - almost as if the effects budget ran out just in time for the climactic scene. Really, I might have to go back and watch it again to see if I was seeing what I think I saw; maybe it will earn another half a star!"
"Dec 13, 2019",0.5,All three of these new prequels sucked.  What a disappointment.
"Dec 12, 2019",5,Definetly my favorite Star Wars movie
"Dec 12, 2019",4.5,From the prequels this is the best
"Dec 12, 2019",4.5,"The most powerful, most emotional, and the better written film in the prequel trilogy. ROTS dives more into the turn of Anakin Skywalker from good to bad. There is less of the cringe dialogue between Anakin and Padme in this than in EP II, they have more chemistry in this film. The CGI is way better than the previous two films. The beginning of the film shows a rescue mission in space and the effects looks very good in it. Hayden Christian performance is much better, there is less of the wooden acting from him, and that might have been down to George Lucas. It is the most powerful in the prequels because you've got the order 66 screen which is powerful on it's own but it has the music from John Williams which is some of his best in the Star Wars franchise, but that's not his best in the film as that belongs to the music that plays over Anakin and Obi-Wan fight at the end of the film, the choreography throughout the prequels is fantastic and it is shown in the final fight between them. It is also fantastic to watch it as a experience. The movie also goes at a quick pace throughout the film, it doesn't really slow down for much. But the only big criticism I've have on this movie is that the whole (Spoliers) Padme dying of a broken heart doesn't really have the emotional effects that Lucas wanted to show and the whole Darth Vader saying NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! Isn't the best thing to hear coming from Vader."
"Dec 12, 2019",3.5,This movie redeems the Prequel Trilogy and avoided some (not all) of the cringe-worthy aspects of the first two movies.
"Dec 11, 2019",4.5,A great plot makes for what is easily the best prequel.
"Dec 11, 2019",4.5,"The way George Lucas pleases the fans in this final episode of the new trilogy, is astonishing, giving them what they wanted and even more, closing characters stories, and giving us some answers that we all had before this trilogy."
"Dec 10, 2019",4,"Episode III concludes the prequels well but not great, the story is good and to see a child turn into such an infamous villain is great to watch and is heart-wrenching. What this movie suffers is more with the directing and the monotone pieces of the script, Ewan saves this movie but there are still weekpoints. Overall love it alot and gives me a nostalgia for better times."
"Dec 10, 2019",3.5,The Fall of Anakin is amazing. The deeper you look the better it gets.
"Dec 09, 2019",3.5,It has not aged well like The Phantom Menace in my opinion. Although the movie does a masterful job on playing on character emotions and the last 3rd of the film is done perfectly.
"Dec 09, 2019",3.5,A relatively satisfying cap to the prequel saga with good character moments and set pieces.
"Dec 09, 2019",5,Great film. Dark and well written. Couple of flaws but mostly perfect. Must watch Star Wars film.
"Dec 04, 2019",5,"Movie got too much hate when it first came out, but turned into an all time classic. One of the best star wars movies ever made. Perfectly balanced with emotion and grit, with the prequel duels."
"Dec 02, 2019",4.5,Way better then any disney one
"Dec 02, 2019",5,Top 3 Star Wars films ever released! And this is by far the best prequel
"Dec 01, 2019",4.5,"The origin story of Darth Vader and prequel to the 1977 Star Wars film, A New Hope!"
"Dec 01, 2019",5,As the final piece of the Skywalker saga for all time to come George did a near perfect job of rounding out the story and does so in his signature style.
"Nov 29, 2019",3.5,This movie was by far the best from the prequel trilogy. There were still some flaws but this movie was the reason why we watched the prequels to begin with. Better CGI and this movie were really dark at the end. It had a good introduction to cinema's most loved space villains. There are things that don't make sense in this film but at least it well in the end.
"Nov 28, 2019",2.5,"More like Revenge of the Sh*t. Episode III still features terrible dialogue and terrible acting from Christensen. Out of the three it’s the least painful to watch but that’s not saying much considering how awful Episode II was, and how terrible Episode I was. "
"Nov 25, 2019",4,By default the best of the prequels.
"Nov 24, 2019",3.5,"Much better than I remember it being! The film does a good job of why people were so willing to ditch the Jedi and Republic in favor of the Empire. The Jedi really did everything the Palpatine accused them of including trying to overthrow him and take over the Senate. Still suffers from a lot Prequel/Lucas-isms including a plot that centers around politics and clunky dialogue. I also refuse to believe that Anakin is a tragic hero. Independent of prior knowledge, it's clear that he's turning evil the entire movie. He wears black leather (in contrast to brown cloth), has a menacing scar and consistently shows that he is arrogant and hateful."
"Nov 24, 2019",4,A good Star Wars movie.
"Nov 21, 2019",5,One of the greatest movies ever made!
"Nov 21, 2019",3.5,"Easily the best of the prequels. There are still issues, like how quickly the turn for Anakin was, the way Padme dies, and some of the acting. But there are some great special effects and action sequences here. The final fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is arguably the best in series history. A very enjoyable entry."
"Nov 20, 2019",5,"My all-time favourite Star Wars movie, and indeed my favourite movie of all time!  A perfectly plotted and executed end of the prequel trilogy and set up for the original trilogy, this is THE movie Star Wars fans waited for for almost 30 years!  It is easily THE most thrilling and exhilarating Star Wars movie, becoming a non-stop thrill ride for most of its running time.  It features THE two greatest lightsaber duels of all time (Palpatine-Yoda and Anakin-Obi-Wan).  The special effects were the greatest at that point in time (and in many ways still rival those of the sequel trilogy &amp; Anthology).  Cast is great, with Ian McDiarmid in particular providing his best performance yet.  Also easily the darkest Star Wars, yet benefits immensely from it."
"Nov 19, 2019",5,REALLY picks up the threads left dangling by the other two. Excellent all around.
"Nov 18, 2019",4,"The final installment of the prequel trilogy is the best film among the three- which isn't saying much at all. Revenge of the Sith is a dark movie and even its few lighthearted moments come under a cloud of grim expectations. Although Revenge of the Sith is the third volume of the prequel trilogy, its quality places it alongside A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back as the best Star Wars has to offer. Its flaws are easily forgiven; it offers the same successful blend of high energy sci-fi melodrama, epic tragedy, and satisfying storytelling provided by Episodes IV and V. In many ways, Revenge of the Sith is the most important chapter of the first six episodes and, until its release, the Star Wars saga remained incomplete. Revenge of the Sith exists not only as a fine chapter in its own right but its existence improves the other five segments, adding context and depth not only to the two other prequels but to all three members of the original trilogy."
"Nov 17, 2019",3.5,"Finally, they're getting better."
"Nov 16, 2019",3.5,"I think the movie is almost entirely held up by the end, as the end has great soundtrack, fights, and dialogue. A great movie for the prequels."
"Nov 16, 2019",3,"Revenge of the Sith is the best of the Star Wars prequels, mainly because the plot gets to the good stuff, with Palpatine finally making his grab for power and the rise of Darth Vader. Sadly, Anakin's turn to the Dark Side and the reveal of the Emperor's true face are fumbled badly, in scenes more likely to illicit giggles than gasps. There's no question that Lucas is a visionary, it's just a shame he didn't see fit to collaborate with other scriptwriters and directors, as this could all have been so much better."
"Nov 16, 2019",3.5,Some underwhelming parts but an overall fitting end
"Nov 16, 2019",5,"For sure the best movie of the prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith shows us the birth of the greatest villain in cinema, with an outstanding performance of all actors, incredible."
"Nov 14, 2019",5,"Best Star Wars, best film"
"Nov 12, 2019",4,"Quite good, better that the previous two prequels and worth of the original Trilogy."
"Nov 12, 2019",4,"It has its flaws. However, there are many redeeming qualities. The story of Emperor Palpatine's rise to power is one of the best story lines to come out of the prequels and to see its climax is quite something. The choreography is near flawless, using real guards and techniques a proper swordsman would use which adds another layer of depth to each fight scene. I would highly recommend this to any and all star wars fans, becoming a must see for those who have watched the clone wars cartoons as it adds even more depth to each character and story arc."
"Nov 12, 2019",3.5,81% || The best of the prequel trillogy. Perfectly ending off Anakin's origin.
"Nov 04, 2019",5,O melhor de todos comparado com ação!
"Nov 03, 2019",4.5,"Revenge of the Sith is certainly a flawed movie, but I defy any Star Wars fan not to enjoy it.

In spite of the gratuitious use of CGI, the storyline of Obi-Wan, Anakin, Padme, and Palpatine is actually an incredibly interesting tale. Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid are absolutely peerless in their embodiment of their characters: the noble Obi-Wan and the sinister Palpatine.

Hayden Christensen, while given some scenes of atrocious dialogue, actually does Anakin justice in several notable scenes. The stoic fear he displays in the scene where he discusses his nightmares with Padme. His anger and frustration when being given a secret spy mission from Obi-Wan. He massively improved from his performance in Attack of the Clones.

The final fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is the most emotionally charged in the franchise's history. While Luke and Vader were father and son, the two hardly knew each other. Anakin and Obi-Wan grew up together and have saved each other's lives countless times. The fight choreography is the best in the series, as well, by far."
"Nov 02, 2019",4,"Finally, out of the prequel series, this is one that I can recommend. It hints at being corny, but I think the overall mood of the series which led up to episode IV brings it to a satisfied conclusion. Some things were high in regard to the storyline. But still, we get this sense of humor that's not needed. Winks and nods to characters in the story seem reliable and it ends in a bad note, but it needed it. It is worthwhile. Still get a kick out of it. I recommend you see it."
"Nov 01, 2019",5,"for me personaly, i think this is the best star wars movie there is.
i loved it the first time i saw it and i still do!
i remember when it came to cinema and the hype serounding it. it was a great time!"
"Oct 31, 2019",5,"really good movie, still gets the prequel hate.
Well these people should start watch the sequels and rate them to get to know what is a bad star wars movie"
"Oct 31, 2019",4.5,"A great finale to its respective trilogy, ""Revenge of the Sith"" has a much darker tone with many thrills and emotions in a movie filled with so much great action and much better acting with a more developed plot, 9/10."
"Oct 31, 2019",4.5,"By all the Prequels, Revenge of the Sith aged the best and is arguably the best of the Prequels"
"Oct 31, 2019",4.5,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith was amazing. I love it.
"Oct 29, 2019",5,My opinion of this film is it is the greatest thing to ever happen to star wars. I love this movie wholeheartedly and believe this film is a must see for anyone.
"Oct 29, 2019",4.5,"Revenge of the sith is an emotionally rich, epic action packed film and necessary addition to the star wars saga, and the savior of the prequels"
"Oct 27, 2019",5,Best movie in the franchise for me.
"Oct 26, 2019",5,very good. The connection and love shown from Ewan Mcgregor (as Obi-Wan) towards Anakin is sublime. A must-see for any star wars fanatic
"Oct 24, 2019",5,This is where the fun begins
"Oct 24, 2019",5,Best star wars movie ever
"Oct 22, 2019",2,Save yourself some time and skip to the last hour. The birth of Darth Vader did not need to be stretched out over 3 bad movies.
"Oct 22, 2019",3.5,Actually kind of enjoyed this film
"Oct 14, 2019",5,amazing so much to love the not just the best prequel its the best star wars movie so much to love it has ever thing action Darth Vader emperor Plapitine and so much much more.
"Oct 11, 2019",4,"Nice ending to the Anakin trilogy, bittersweet and good fights. It shows how an heroic and compassionate religion can work for and help create a great evil."
"Oct 10, 2019",0.5,Too much walking and talking
"Oct 09, 2019",5,"I loved the stunts. By far some of the best fighting, and the soundtrack was amazing too. I wish we'd go back to this style instead of what we got."
"Oct 09, 2019",4.5,"I love this movie but like every other film it has some minor bad parts, but overall it is enjoyable to watch."
"Oct 07, 2019",4,"The climax of the prequel trilogy, Star Wars Revenge of the Sith brings balance to the force by closing all loose ends between the two trilogies, portraying Anakin's fall to the Dark Side and the rise of Darth Vader. A satisfying conclusion, ROTS has four of the best duels in the saga, with expert swordmsanship from Ewan Mcgregor and Hayden Christensen. It also introduces fan favourites to the saga such as General Grievous, a four-armed cyborg with asthma, and clones such as Commander Cody, who were destined to become iconic through the Clone Wars television series. Despite some incredible special effects for its time, the movie suffers from poor scripts and dialogue, resulting in lines such as ""From my point of view the Jedi are evil"", and ""You're shorter than I expected"". John Williams delivered an impeccable score however, superbly supporting scenes such as Order 66 with themes of tragedy and sadness. George Lucas's final Star Wars film provided the emotional height of the saga, the tragic betrayal of the Jedi setting up the original trilogy's feeling of hope and desperation well."
"Oct 06, 2019",5,amazing dont listen to the haters
"Oct 06, 2019",5,As much as I'd hate to say it it's my favorite Star Wars movie. Although far from perfect it has a certain charm to it with very fun and exciting action scenes. I just love this mo
"Oct 06, 2019",4,"Great story, plot, and effects. 
Unfortunately, some of the execution is just not there. Scenes that should have had some better progression (ie: Anakins decent to madness) were rushed. It lacked some depth with showing the other members of the council being taken down by storm troopers and missed a huge opportunity for an action sequence. Nonetheless, it tied up the prequel trilogy nice in terms of storyline. "
"Oct 02, 2019",5,The movie is full of memes. Enough said. All is the best of Prequels
"Sep 30, 2019",5,Revenge of the Sith deserves more credit than it gets. It's always been my favorite of the prequel trilogy and in my opinion has the best choreography and scoring in the series
"Sep 28, 2019",4,"Really a well made film. Best prequel by far. Excellent plot, action was epic, acting was good, cinematography was beautiful, and some of the best music ever. Really an Integral part of the Star Wars experience."
"Sep 28, 2019",5,Literally the best Star Wars movie ever made. Also the most underrated Star Wars ever made. The reviews don't give this film enough justice. The storyline is phenomenal and Ian McDiarmid as emperor Palpatine is one of the best performances of all time. 
"Sep 28, 2019",5,Best Star Wars film 
"Sep 28, 2019",4,The final pre-queal of the Star Wars saga we've been waiting so far.
"Sep 23, 2019",5,"One of the best Star Wars film to date. Amazing scenery, great story telling, and a great end to a trilogy. Couldn't be happier with the movie."
"Sep 23, 2019",4.5,"While this movie has its very noticable flaws, the general consensus around this movie is in my opinion wrong and Revenge Of The Sith is a good way to end off the Prequel trilogy."
"Sep 21, 2019",0.5,I wish they had left the original trilogy alone! I appreciate that these three films were planned to come out first but really?!? I thought the effects of the original films were actually more realistic. I thought Ewan McGregor was the poorest choice for Obi Wan. But who could replace Alec Guinness? This truly was an awful film. 
"Sep 18, 2019",4,"The best film of the prequels.  This film has great special effects and story writing.  It feels a little convoluted at times, but in essence, it IS a Star Wars film in feel and in name.  "
"Sep 18, 2019",5,"If someone wants to see a Star Wars movie even after watching all of them, I would recommend this. It has everything a Star Wars fan would want. The Clone Wars, the Jedi, the sith, the Republic, the Empire, Dooku, Palpatine, Vader, Luke, Leia, the Millennium Falcon, Grievous, Jar Jar, amazing lightsaber battles, and amazing CGI. "
"Sep 16, 2019",4,"A lot of people say Revenge Of The Sith is the best of the Prequel Trilogy, and I agree it is indeed. The visuals, even the performances of the cast has greatly improved thanks to the much needed improvement from George Lucas' writing and direction. But honestly, I still prefer The Phantom Menace at the end of the day. "
"Sep 15, 2019",4,"The perfect end to the prequel trilogy. Brilliant actions scenes creating some classic Star Wars moments. The iconic rise of Vader being one such moment. Well acted by McGregor, Portman and Mcdiarmid who move the film brilliantly "
"Sep 15, 2019",4,"Best of the prequels. An enjoyable watch with lots of action and one of the best lines in the Star Wars Saga - ""I have the high ground""."
"Sep 14, 2019",3,"Often eschewing logic and having a central couple with zero chemistry sinks this love story, but at its core Revenge of the Sith is an interesting tragedy that manages to tie up the prequels satisfyingly while setting up the events of A New Hope boosted by a strong performance from Ewan McGregor, and one of the best (and longest) lightsaber duels of the whole saga."
"Sep 14, 2019",5,This is where the fun begins!
"Sep 13, 2019",5,Very dark like it should be the best movie from the prequels by far
"Sep 12, 2019",5,This is a great movie. In my opinion this is the best star wars movie ever made. Yes this movie does have some flaws but everything else in the movie throws those flaws out the window. The cast are so much better in this movie the best being Ewan Mcgregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi 
"Sep 12, 2019",4,"By far the best of the Prequel Trilogy. Wraps up the 6 part saga beautifully. Beautifully shot and the score, Fantastic. John Williams at his best. Ian McDiarmid is brilliant as the Emporer.
"
"Sep 11, 2019",5,Best Star Wars movie made....  
"Sep 11, 2019",4.5,Personally I love this movie. Very surprised to see such a low audience rating. Sad actually. Yoda vs Sidious and Vader vs Obi wan are classic scenes that will live forever in movie folklore. 
"Sep 10, 2019",3,"The one prequel worth watching. The digital filmmaking techniques Lucas has been developing for years finally payed off, and the more dramatic story naturally paved the way for much more interesting and polished art direction (especially considering this is a space epic). Many problems of the other prequels are still there, especially cause they mostly have to do with world and character building, but there are also a number of memorable epic scenes and the story is very focused(presumably cause we already know the ending) and actually meaningful politics this time. The darkness also brings an interesting flavor of Star Wars hinted at in The Empire Strikes Back. You'll have a good time if you don't think too much about how it connects to the original trilogy(the answer is surprisingly too well)."
"Sep 10, 2019",5,Best start wars movie. Epic wars in the stars
"Sep 09, 2019",4.5,The best Star Wars film
"Sep 08, 2019",5,Better than all of the new ones!
"Sep 08, 2019",5,"space battles were epic, fight scenes were epic, very emotinal, overall just one of the best movies of all time
"
"Sep 08, 2019",3.5,"My personal favorite star wars film, BUT not the best. It would be if what it tried to be came to fruition 100% of the time."
"Sep 08, 2019",4,"After 3 attemps, they finally got it right. This is what the Prequel Trilogy should have been from the very start. Sure, the effects and acting woes are still there, but the story and pacing are a vast improvement. This movie hooks you from beginning to end, and is worthy of its Star Wars name."
"Sep 08, 2019",5,Best Ever. Best opening of any movie and galaxy shattering ending cannot be replicated ever again
"Sep 06, 2019",5,Im giving this 5 stars 1.because im a man of culture.  2. Because obi wan indeed did have the high ground.
"Sep 06, 2019",5,This movie was a masterpiece of Scifi. The ending  will blow you away and the tension it builds is incredible.
"Sep 06, 2019",4,From the get go you can tell this is the story Lucas was trying to tell in the prequels. hands down the best entry in the series regarding the prequels. personally this film ranks highly compared to the others also.
"Sep 06, 2019",5,best memes ever r/PrequelMemes
"Sep 06, 2019",5,Jesus saw this movie and was inspired to create the galaxy.
"Sep 05, 2019",3,I think George needed more than 3 movies to really do Anakin's journey to the dark side some justice. Some of it seemed rushed and out of place.
"Sep 04, 2019",4,"Loved this flim, I used to like it more than a new hope, this flim had a great ending to, would have been better had lucas kept the scene were yoda lands on dagoba where luke meets up with him 20 years later but lucas always wanted yoda to be a mystery, so I'll give that a pass. My main problem with this flim is how anakin assume padme and obi wan were in cahoots that made zero sense to me."
"Sep 04, 2019",5,The best film in the star wars saga
"Sep 03, 2019",5,the best star wars movie!!!
"Sep 03, 2019",3,"Revenge of the Sith is an entertaining and thrilling end to the Star Wars prequel trilogy, even if the plot is still rushed and a bit uneven."
"Sep 03, 2019",4,A fun interesting ride with a lot of action 
"Sep 03, 2019",3.5,I thought it was a good movie with some great battles in it and some relatively good CGI.
"Sep 02, 2019",5,Revenge Of The Sith. Is my favorite film of all time with The Empires Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi. It really came full circle for me.
"Sep 02, 2019",5,One of the best movies ever made
"Aug 30, 2019",3,The added reviews in the past couple years make this out to be better than it really is. It was and will always be a 69%. It’s definitely not a B-. 
"Aug 27, 2019",5,"Masterpiece of a movie, tied together the superb Star Wars plot and saga engineered by George Lucas, special effects stunning, plot emotional and exciting and one of the most memorable movies you'll ever watch."
"Aug 24, 2019",5,This is the stars wars movie. 
"Aug 24, 2019",5,"This is among the best Star Wars Movies ever made, Don't let the first two mediocre movies from the prequel trilogy fool you.  This movie was a masterpiece."
"Aug 24, 2019",2,"Overrated. Yes, it is better than the other prequels but not by that much. The acting is still terrible, the writing is even worse, the story is not only predictable but extremely lazy and the cgi looks like a video game. It's not terrible but not good either. Meh is about right."
"Aug 23, 2019",4.5,The best prequel-movie and my favorite!
"Aug 23, 2019",5,The best of the prequels...
"Aug 23, 2019",5,My personal favorite in the star wars saga. This movie starts off with a terrific opening scene and has the best action out of all the movies in the saga.
"Aug 21, 2019",5,best star wars movie.
"Aug 21, 2019",5,Galaxy shattering movie that for ever destroyed republic and Jedi order.
"Aug 20, 2019",3.5,"With Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas brings his second Star Wars trilogy to a suitably thrilling and often poignant -- if still a bit uneven -- conclusion."
"Aug 20, 2019",4,It has some of the best star wars scenes of all time like order 66 and Anakin vs Obi Wan. But for it still has the same terrible writing and storytelling that we saw in the first 2 prequels. This isn't an amazing movie but it is a very rewatchable movie that gets more praise than it exactly deserves.
"Aug 18, 2019",4.5,"Some many good scenes, so a powerful story."
"Aug 13, 2019",5,Best SW by far. This is SW trikogy that really worth something telling story of falling civilization and not OT. OT don't even have depth
"Aug 11, 2019",4,"How to redeem a saga! This is a great Star Wars movie, far better than Attack of the Clones and the Phantom Menace. There are some many cool fight scenes I need a page to write them down. Hayden Christensen is much better here than Attack, through hes still far behind other actors like Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson. Apart from the whole Padme thing, a great movie even if it is a little tiring. "
"Aug 11, 2019",5,Nothing more can be said except Best SW in history and non will ever reach its heights
"Aug 10, 2019",5,Excellent conclusion of one of greatest trilogies of all time
"Aug 10, 2019",5,For me story end with this. Im not interesed in obsolete trilogy not in defeat of Sith. Republic has fallen and empire was raised. No more Jedi and small rebellion are not of interest to me.
"Aug 08, 2019",2.5,It's an improvement in this chaotic unnecessary trilogy. 
"Aug 07, 2019",5,Amazing!! The battles and the entire soundtrack are one of the best things of the movie.
"Aug 03, 2019",5,The best one and that's obvious
"Aug 02, 2019",2,"Easily the best of the prequels, but by no means a masterpiece. I like the opening space battle, Palpatine and that's about it. 4/10."
"Aug 01, 2019",5,It's so fantastic this is the only movie of the prequel saga that reminds me of the old Star Wars movies and the Darth Vader transformation was brilliant
"Aug 01, 2019",5,For me this Star Wars movie is the best movie. I think every film is good but this is the best. 
"Aug 01, 2019",5,This is The Best out of all of the Star wars prequels. I enjoyed this movie. I watched it 300 times. 
"Jul 30, 2019",3.5,This is the best movie of the prequel trilogy telling us how anakin became Vader and also shows us how Luke got to tatooine and How Liea ended up in Aldeeran
"Jul 28, 2019",5,"Though the prequel trilogy may not had started the best way, it ends on a thrilling, exciting and awesome way, with great character development, amazing visual effects and splendid battle sequences. "
"Jul 28, 2019",3.5,Both the phantom Menace and attack of the clones had the potential to be great movies. But each one had a movie-wide problem that made the movie average overall. Revenge of the sith is the result of that potential being used to it's full ability. Giving us undoubtedly the best Star Wars prequel.
"Jul 25, 2019",3,I guess I liked it. This trilogy really did live up to its potential.
"Jul 22, 2019",5,One of the all time greats
"Jul 22, 2019",5,This movie has the high ground out of any Star Wars movie. Real emotion felt. Disney feels watered down. Like hey guys likes blow up the death star a third time! Wow that is so inventive... Also let’s have Rey never have any training just be really good with a lightsaber because girl power... Kylon ren is also a whiny schoolgirl. Gimme Darth Sidious Anyday. Infinite power! 
"Jul 22, 2019",5,"A perfect film, in every way. Great story, visuals, choreography, and average script."
"Jul 22, 2019",5,"10/10 Best Star Wars Movie to date. CGI still holds up almost 15 years later. Great emotional beats and a perfect score, holds up nicely both as a stand-alone film and as the finale in the 6 part franchise orchestrated by George Lucas"
"Jul 22, 2019",5,Amazing. A stunning piece of history
"Jul 22, 2019",5,"Lucas' true masterpiece. Simply breathtaking

"
"Jul 22, 2019",5,A work of modern art
"Jul 22, 2019",5,Best prequel movie forsure. A great tale of the rise of Vader and the end of the clone wars. A must watch in my opinion and much better than the films Disney has come up with.
"Jul 22, 2019",4.5,This is where the fun begins.
"Jul 22, 2019",5,The best Star Wars movie ever!
"Jul 22, 2019",5,Some movies get better with time. The full range of pure emotion that this film conveys is striking.
"Jul 22, 2019",5,Excellent movie. It’s easily the best movie of the prequel trilogy. This along with the prequels have only gotten better for me over the years. I love the work of George Lucas and appreciate it all the positive impact the films had on me growing up. 
"Jul 22, 2019",4.5,"It's one of my favorite Star Wars movies.

also the only Star Wars movie I can't make it through without crying, if I am lucky enough to make it through, cos Order 66 is too fucking sad

all the clones :("
"Jul 22, 2019",5,Classic. Far better than the sequals. 
"Jul 22, 2019",5,Revenge of the Sith. It's a bold one
"Jul 21, 2019",5,Incredible. Arguably the most compelling star wars yet
"Jul 21, 2019",5,Never saw the twist ending coming 
"Jul 21, 2019",5,"Amazing.
Epic conclusion to the Prequel trilogy and holds up perfectly to this day. The duels and score are by far the best of the saga, far beyond what the newer movies and shows can match."
"Jul 21, 2019",5,home of literally the best lightsaber fights in star wars it is a must-see
"Jul 21, 2019",4,Classic. Slightly rushed but good overall.
"Jul 21, 2019",5,Epic. It is critical we send a positive review there immideatly
"Jul 21, 2019",5,Best Star Wars movie ever!
"Jul 21, 2019",4.5,I love this movie. Not even ironically or as a meme. I just love this movie. Will watch whenever it's on. Never gets old. 
"Jul 21, 2019",5,"This movie beatuifully captures the internal conflict Anakin is suffering from, the rise of the Empire with the fantastic Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine capturing the role as Palpatine perfectly. Not to mention amazing special effects and John Williams best to date music."
"Jul 21, 2019",5,"Revenge of the Sith was a great ending for the Prequel trilogy, perhaps the greatest there could've been. It has come to be an absolute classic, by both telling a great story and by being as Star Wars as Star Wars could be. It didn't only tie off the Prequel trilogy, it also serves as a bridge to the originals."
"Jul 21, 2019",5,The greatest movie of our generation.
"Jul 21, 2019",5,"Revenge of the Sith was the Chosen One! It was said to destroy the bad press of the previous movies, not join them! Bring balance to the Prequels, not leave them in darkness!... And it did!"
"Jul 21, 2019",5,It's the best movie of all time. 
"Jul 21, 2019",5,Favorite fight scene ever
"Jul 21, 2019",5,"One of the best Star Wars films. This movie is dark, morbid and emotionally impactful, but still has some quipped moments. If lucas had made the first two prequels the way he made this one, the prequels could have been awesome movies. But, this is the only great prequel. Phantom menace is ok and attack of the clones is dogshit"
"Jul 21, 2019",5,It's over Anakin I have the high ground
"Jul 21, 2019",5,Best Star Wars movie! Love it!
"Jul 21, 2019",5,11/10 Best star wars film don't @ me
"Jul 21, 2019",3.5,Have you ever heard the tragedy of the ROS audience score? It’s not something the Rotten Tomatoes executives would tell you...
"Jul 21, 2019",4.5,"Saw it when I was 15, fun movie. Would watch again."
"Jul 21, 2019",4,"It was good, not as good as the originals but better than the other prequels and pretty emotional."
"Jul 21, 2019",3.5,The only prequel in the Star Wars franchise I would recommend!
"Jul 19, 2019",5,Best ending to the prequels and originals
"Jul 18, 2019",4.5,"Star Wars revenge of the Sith successfully caps off the prequel era. It seemed like this movie did few things wrong. Anakin Skywalker was a way better protagonist in the beginning of the movie. The story was absolutely incredible and the cgi was great for its time. This film is on par with the original movies. It included an amazing scene with Palpatine explaining to Anakin about Darth Plagueis that was portrayed flawlessly! The romance was a little bit better but was still nonetheless cringeworthy. I personally think this film was underrated. My only problems were how they handled Padme at the end (a broken heart really), the fight between the Emporer and Yoda (we don't need lightsabers), General Grevious (he was portrayed as a coward), and weird dialogue. I personally thought Anakins beginning lightsaber fight scene was pretty good as it showed how powerful Anakin has become since we saw him in Attack of the Clones. It's hard for me to say a lot of negatives about this movie because there aren't many negatives. This movie successfully closes out the prequel era and transitions into the original era. In my opinion the prequels failed to capitalize on their main characters as they had so much potential to be great. I think the handling of their main characters wasn't perfect but did a lot better than the previous two movies. The Anakin and Obi Wan friendship in the beginning was a great example of that. I thought this movie successfully closed out the prequel era and I would recommend it"
"Jul 16, 2019",4.5,"definitely the strongest of the star wars prequel trilogy, and my personal favorite. this movie truly felt like a tragedy, and you felt the emotion after order 66 and anakin's fall to the dark side. while the dialogue was still scrappy at some points, it was a true dot-connector. "
"Jul 15, 2019",3.5,"Everyone loves ROTS, and don't get me wrong I love it too, but it's still a prequel with hokey acting, dated visuals and some bland characters. McGregor, Oz, and Jackson make the prequels worth watching, and as I said before this is a good film, but to say it's the best Star Wars film is a long shot for me. The prequels took focus from the stories away in favor of world building, but this film focuses back on the story and puts things on track to stick the landing. (albeit a little bumpy) This definently has some of the best sequences and scenes in any SW film. The Mustafar fight, Order 66, General Grevious vs Obi-Wan. As I said before the visuals for this film have become SOOOO dated it's not even funny, normally I wouldn't complain, but The Lord of the Rings came out around the same time, and this is Star Wars they are known for there Visual Effects. Hayden Christiansen's acting is bad, but I blame that on Lucas' direction, and Portman clearly just isn't into it (feeling more like a daytime SOAP actor, and yeah I know Star Wars is like a soap opera, but it's also a big budget blockbuster movie, so come on.) I prefer The Original Trilogy and The Sequel Trilogy over this film, but it's well made and I still get goosebumps when I see that mask draped over Vader's face."
"Jul 15, 2019",3.5,Revenge of the sith is the best movie in the prequel trilogy which may not be saying much but it is still fairly decent the cgi is miles better and is alot more entertaining and better as far as movie making goes but the movie still suffers from Hayden Christensens bad acting and still has terrible dialogue but is definitely an improvement from the previous two films and deserves a 7/10
"Jul 13, 2019",4.5,SW Episode 3 is by far the best out of the entire Prequel trilogy! 
"Jul 12, 2019",4,"3rd (story-wise) in the Star Wars saga, it's the movie that finally connects the prequels with the old trilogy. The main enemy finally shows his true face and we finally see how the most iconic villain of the series came to existence, while seeing the downfall of the Jedis and with them the old republic. The Siths' plan and actions are smart, unforeseen and implacable. The action is still there, and the tension and emotion remain present. The dialog and romance aren't still quite at the level we could expect, but the overall scenario feels sound and on par with the rest of the saga."
"Jul 10, 2019",3.5,A Entertaining Ride at Home.
"Jul 08, 2019",5,For me story ends with ep 3. I don't care for OT or ST. Star Wars for me is fall of republic and jedi and rise of sith and empire. OT I have not watched from 2005 nor I'm planning to ever again. PT only for me
"Jul 08, 2019",3.5,"Surprisingly, Lucas finally brings on the big screen, the explanation of the events of the original trilogy, and is explained well!"
"Jul 03, 2019",5,Best Star Wars of all. Star Wars are Sith and Jedi and battle between light and dark. This is last true SW. Nothing in future will show that struggle. Especially not The Mandalorian who will be SW just in name because no wars or duels will be there.
"Jul 03, 2019",4,"A dramatic emotional conclusion of the trilogy. Although badly acted in some cases and certainly unevenly paced, a fitting and thrilling story."
"Jul 02, 2019",4.5,A great and chilling end to the trilogy.
"Jun 29, 2019",4.5,It's in my top 5 of favorite Star Wars films. Easily the best of the prequels. McDiarmid steals the show and is phenomenal in every scene he is. Hayden is much better in this one than Episode II. Definitely the darkest Star Wars movie to date.
"Jun 19, 2019",5,"An exciting, entertaining and challenging conclusion to the prequel trilogy, combined with Lucas's direction and script, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Tattersall's cinematography, Burtt and Barton's editing, Bocquet's production design, Roberts and Giovanni's set decoration, Biggar's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, Revenge Of The Sith is the best and most entertaining of the prequels and challenges The Empire Strikes Back for the title of darkest Star Wars story!"
"Jun 18, 2019",5,The best of the saga
"Jun 17, 2019",4,"Another trilogy ends; unexpectedly, it doesn't end on a whimper. ROTS solves its dialogue problem by having a great story and numerous, fantastic action sequences. "
"Jun 14, 2019",3,"It is considered better than first two preuql films, but come on. its build off cliches, predictble plots and twits, and awkward lines.
Not theat legendary unlike star wars glory days."
"Jun 11, 2019",4,Revenge of the Sith is underated and is my third favorite Star Wars movie.
"Jun 11, 2019",4,Best of the prequels! Great to see the Vader origin!
"Jun 07, 2019",5,"Absolutely love it, has everything a Star Wars movie, must have, and the final showdown between Obi and Annakin are cherry pie"
"Jun 06, 2019",5,"This movie is excellent, Ewan McGregor is fantastic as Obi-Wan."
"Jun 06, 2019",5,No one can top this movie! This is star wars in its truest form
"Jun 05, 2019",2,"If your not with me, then you're my enemy "
"Jun 04, 2019",5,Its the best movie of the saga
"Jun 04, 2019",2,Don't see how this one has a higher rating than the other two. It is the most predictable and hardest to watch of the prequels. The only saving grace is Ewan McGregor
"Jun 03, 2019",5,Best SW movie ever and only ep2 ending with battle on Geonisys was better
"Jun 03, 2019",2,Not as bad as I once thought
"Jun 01, 2019",5,Best Star Wars ever 
"May 31, 2019",5,Anakin cut hand from Windu is point of no return. His wife was more important to him than Jedi Order
"May 30, 2019",5,"This film adds the most action of all star wars films. It's crammed with lightsaber duels, space battles and deception. The second half does a good job tying up the loose ends between the prequels and the originals."
"May 28, 2019",5,"Now this movie is definitely one of my all time favorite Star Wars movies ever!! I'll never forget watching this movie with my dad when I was 5 year old, it was a really beautiful movie!! John Williams' scores were amazing, the CGI improved majorly, Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor's performances were amazing and the acting was some what good. The tiny flaws about this movie that I still dislike to this day are the scenes with Anakin and Padme, those scenes always bore me to death. The acting seems really lazy in those scenes and is somewhat cheesy in the one scene on Mustafar before the lightsaber duel.

Overall, this movie was an awesome closing to the prequel series. The best parts of the movie for me was Anakin and Obi-Wan in their ships in the beginning, the fight with Count Dooku, Palpatine fighting Mac Windu and the final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan. 
"
"May 27, 2019",5,The first two episodes may not have been George's bets outing... but man did he make up for them with the final installment.
"May 27, 2019",5,"I don't care what others say, this is a damn good movie."
"May 25, 2019",5,The essence of Star Wars!
"May 20, 2019",4.5,It is recomended for PG 10.The actors is vary very cool. He rpresents the history in a way inprecionant. And is vary dificult to represet. they can do this. Congratulations
"May 19, 2019",5,"Visual mastery and complex story allow this movie to surpass all the other prequels, if not all the rest of the Star Wars movies."
"May 19, 2019",5,"This is Star Wars!
Battles everywhere, lightsaber duels, Jedi has fallen into trap of Sidious and he managed to cought them by surprise destroying them.
Jedi Council was corrupt and power hungry as much as sith.
Best Star wars movie"
"May 17, 2019",5,"Lo mejor, espectacular"
"May 17, 2019",5,"Excellent, the best movie of the Star Wars"
"May 15, 2019",5,"Fantastic, thrilling and visually beautiful. Star Wars episode 3 is wonderful fit to the saga. Better script and better dialogue. This film is a vast improvement of its other two predecessors, and is a MUST WATCH. Don't let the bad reviews fool you into thinking otherwise. TAKE MY WORD FOR IT."
"May 15, 2019",5,"An amazing movie that brought a touching conclusion to the end of the prequel trilogy, and to the end of the story of Anakin Skywalker, Jedi Knight."
"May 14, 2019",4,It is a very good movie it's a good way to conclude the prequels it's obviously a very underrated Star Wars movie I think anyone could like it's fun to go to action heart Etc.
"May 13, 2019",5,"best movie of the prequels, heartbreaking, masterpiece of george lucas."
"May 13, 2019",5,"This movie has the highground!!!

(Over the sequels especially)"
"May 11, 2019",5,One of my all time favorites. 
"May 09, 2019",5,My favourite of them all
"May 06, 2019",4.5,"Say what you will about the performances and some of the dialogue, But the Story, World-building, design, and effects are some of the best Hollywood has to offer."
"May 06, 2019",5,"This was a great movie , people hate on it for nothing "
"May 05, 2019",5,"An Amazing Plot, Awesome special effects for 2005. Hayden Christensen really stepped it up.... The score can leave you with goosebumps...Clone Troopers are great and General Grievous is an interesting and thrilling character. Revenge of the Sith is a thrilling film that I rank as my NO.1 Star Wars film."
"May 04, 2019",3,"This is now the 11th time I've seen Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith and I can gladly say that it was as good as the last time I watched it.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the 6th Star Wars film and the 3rd Star Wars prequel. The film was directed by George Lucas who also directed Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. The film stars Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker and Ian McDiarmid as Sheev Palpatine.


The acting unlike the last two films was steady from the emotion to the dialogue delivery. There were a couple bad actors, but for the most part I felt that the acting was quiet good. I also thought that Hayden Christensen did quiet a good job unlike the his portrayal in the last two films.


The characters/character arcs I found my self enjoying and even liking this time around. Unlike the last two films the characters are both written and portrayed a lot better.


The film also has some strong cinematography with some very good shots of the characters and scenery.


The film also has some strong memorable settings from the planet Mustafar to General Grievous's ship.


The set designs and props are done very well from the building designs to the various weapons.


The costume design and makeup is also done very well especially with the Jedi and Sith.


The special effects improve on the last two films, but are still dated. Some of the CGI looks good with the ships and machinery, but when the CGI is a living breathing life form it always looks off.


The action also improves on the last two films especially the duels between the Jedi and Sith. Some times it's a little over the top, but that doesn't really bother me.


The music like most of John Williams work is really strong and fits the film very well.


The story is also the strongest and most enjoyable of the prequels. The story in my opinion is done very well and is one of the stronger story's from the Star Wars universe.


The comedy didn't work for me, but luckily most of it is toward the beginning.


The film toward the beginning had a okay atmosphere, but from the 2nd act onward the film had a very strong atmosphere especiallyaround the character Anakin Skywalker.

I also want to point out that in my opinion the scenes between Anakin and Palpatine are handled exetremly well.


The film is also really enjoyable and is something that I could watch again and again.

Over all I give it a
6/10
60%
3/5


""Master Skywalker there are two many of them what are we going to do?"""
"May 04, 2019",4,"Even though Hayden Christensen is given the worst dialogue and direction possible, the rest of Revenge of the Sith actually feels like a Star Wars movie. Visual storytelling, a good mythos, and possibly the greatest lightsaber fight at the end make the film an enjoyable watch."
"May 03, 2019",5,This and the last of the trilogy are the best
"May 03, 2019",3.5,"This isn't a perfect movie, but it is pretty good. Hayden Christiansen is a terrible actor, but there's some other great scenes in this like the opera scene or the final battle, Ewan McGregor is quite good in this as well."
"Apr 29, 2019",4,"Similar to the other films in this trilogy, it is messy at parts. The second half seems rushed and tries to squeeze everything in and makes you feel the past two films are useless. Simply, the thrill of seeing the younger characters from the originals participating in epic duels is unbelievable. This makes the film visually undeniably brilliant and exciting. It provides a satisfying explanation for the beginning of the original trilogy."
"Apr 28, 2019",3.5,"This movie feels like George Lucas forgot where he was going in this trilogy in this film and in some cases it can be watched without the other two episodes in this trilogy. It seems, from a long-time viewer of this saga of films, that the first two prequels are mostly pointless in the overarching saga making this film have to pick up the pace and fill in any plot points left out to bridge the gap to A New Hope. This film is very rushed and tries to cover a lot of ground very quickly, but overall it does a pretty good job doing so. A lot of the performances are well-acted and the shots set up are mostly nice looking ecpecially for the time."
"Apr 26, 2019",3.5,"Episode III will always hold a special place in my heart. It completed the epic six part saga George Lucas created in 1977, all while being a decent movie on its own. While many older Star Wars fans may have been disappointed in the over-usage of CGI and flashy set pieces, Episode III contains one of the best lightsaber battles in the entire saga. "
"Apr 25, 2019",5,The prequels are great
"Apr 24, 2019",4,"This is definitely the best out of the prequel saga. They had a lot of story to cover since the first two did not cover much ground when it came to Anakin. The movie has decent pacing, decent CGI, good action, and a good amount of entertainment."
"Apr 19, 2019",5,"So far (April, 2019), my favorite Star Wars movie!"
"Apr 18, 2019",2,Better than I but not by much
"Apr 17, 2019",3.5,"Best one of the prequels. some clumpsy dialogue and the worst ""Noooo"" in movie history, but still very enjoyable."
"Apr 15, 2019",4,This is the a fun and cohesive way to begin one of the most beloved trilogies in the galaxy.
"Apr 13, 2019",4.5,"The best of the prequels, Revenge of the Sith is a entirely entertaining and satisfying conclusion with lots of great action, effects and character moments. If only Hayden Was a better actor"
"Apr 13, 2019",4,Probably my favorite STAR WARS movie! This is amazing!
"Apr 12, 2019",5,one of the best star war films to date
"Apr 07, 2019",3.5,"If you're just looking to set your brain aside and enjoy stylized violence with good visual effects, this is actually a pretty fine movie for that."
"Apr 07, 2019",5,10/10 best sci-fi movie and best movie ever.
"Apr 01, 2019",5,"By far the best of the prequels and in my opinion, the best of the Saga."
"Mar 31, 2019",1,"Often regarded as the best of this trilogy, this movie only compounds the disappointments of the earlier two installments. By this point, its difficult to determine if Haden Christiansen's performance is solely a result of a lack of talent, or if it stems from Lucas' inability to direct. By this point, the story has also wandered so far afield that only the best direction could have corrected it - which this movie makes not attempt to do. An hour of lightsaber duels amounts to nothing of interest. The over-saturation of Jedi in-fighting becomes so boring, and the preposterous tensions of the main characters' personal conflicts so stilted, that even the climactic moment of Darth Vader' creation is almost comically awkward - an unconscious, subverted parody of the audience's expectations. If ever the cynics of the world needed an example of how masses of people can be manipulated into mindlessly swallowing schlock, this is it."
"Mar 31, 2019",4.5,A satisfying and exciting conclusion to the story of the fall of Anakin Skywalker and rise of Darth Vader.
"Mar 30, 2019",5,i really love this movie is one of the best  of all star wars
"Mar 29, 2019",5,i like it had some slow parts but pretty good
"Mar 28, 2019",3.5,"It's not as much as the episode 5, but it's also quiet enjoyable."
"Mar 24, 2019",4,Movie starts off slow but gets better. The last 30 minutes of the movie is amazing!
"Mar 24, 2019",5,incredible and perfect movie
"Mar 23, 2019",4.5,the best star wars movie in my opinion
"Mar 22, 2019",3.5,"I'm always conflicted in this movie. This movie is a mess but it is really fun to watch. There are many things to love in this movie. I love the storytelling and character development of Anakin Skywalker. There is a lot of emotional weight and high stakes in this movie. The action scenes are really fun to watch. My biggest problem with this movie is that it had to follow the dumpster fire that was Attack of the Clones and try to be good. Also, Hayden Christensen's acting is still awful in this movie. When this movie is good, it's amazing. However, when this movie is bad, it's dreadful. Fortunately, the positives do outweigh the negatives for me. Grade: B"
"Mar 20, 2019",3.5,"La mejor pelÃ­cula de la segunda trilogÃ­a y eso es decir mucho, tiene algunas forzadas pero el aire de derrota le ayuda mucho a la historia, varias cosas pasan porque tienen que pasar para que coincida con la trilogÃ­a original"
"Mar 18, 2019",5,Episode III is by far the GREATEST Star Wars film to ever be produced. The movie perfectly portrays all the characters and is by far superior to the original trilogy and the garbage disney movies that should never have been made to begin with.
"Mar 18, 2019",4,"Say what ever you want about the other two Prequels, they probably deserve it, but this IS a good Star Wars movie. 
In this movie they finally got the brother relationship between Anakin and Obi-wan right. Jar Jar is not present (thank God). Yoda kicks awesome butt.  
Now there are problems though, there is still some terrible line deliveries, mostly by Hayden Christianson. 
But I still say this is a good Star Wars movie."
"Mar 17, 2019",2.5,"With too much corny dialogue, Anakin's turn to the dark side feels silly and contrived. Too much cartoon physics, such as the lightsaber battle on lava."
"Mar 16, 2019",4.5,"I think I like Revenge of the Sith as much as The Empire Strikes Back.  My only gripe with the movie was really Anakin's seemingly turning to the Dark side so fast.  I know it wasn't fast and he always had that darkness as a child.  It was just ""the straw that broke the camel's back"" was really when he stopped Mace from killing Palpatine by cutting his hand off, thereby inadvertently letting Palpatine kill him.  Ok, so he screwed up big time, but just turning to the Dark side because Palpatine told him, he could help Padme was just stupid.  He should have been kicked out of the Jedi Order and probably some imprisonment of some sort.  But the acting from Ian McDirmant and Ewan McGregor was excellent."
"Mar 15, 2019",3.5,Sceneggiatura buona. Recitazione buona. Scenografia buona. Colonna sonora ottima. Complessivamente buon film; Voto: 8
"Mar 13, 2019",4.5,"good lightsabers duels and visual effects, good ending for the prequels."
"Mar 12, 2019",3.5,This explains how Anakin wanted to be a sith but meh it’s ok 
"Mar 12, 2019",5,I liked the sequels. there!!
"Mar 11, 2019",5,Best Star Wars film ever in my opinion! It just truly shows how  Anakin became the dark lord we truly love.
"Mar 10, 2019",5,My favourite movie by far
"Mar 10, 2019",5,"The best one of the Prequel, I loved that first space battle scene"
"Mar 10, 2019",1,Can't say i enjoyed it to be honest. I preferred the older movies.
"Mar 09, 2019",3.5,Not a great film but the lightsaber fights and the final battle is awesome. Has the Starwars core and true to the mythos.
"Mar 09, 2019",3.5,Should have been better but they wanted kids to be able to see this.
"Mar 09, 2019",2.5,To me its proof that Lucas never planned out a prequel.  The worst prequel and still miles better than the Disney reboots. Violence for the sake of it. #NoRoleModels
"Mar 09, 2019",4,The best of prequel movies by far. Great action scenes and Hayden's acting got a little better. Dialogue improved vastly from 1 and 2 as well.
"Mar 09, 2019",3,"Hmpf! This movie is really good. Yet it can't shake of some of the stupid things the previous two failed at (bad dialogue, bad CGI etc). A shame because this could have been excellent!"
"Mar 09, 2019",3.5,"it was for me yeah ok, however like all prequals you sort of know who isn't going to die and who are expendable, with all of these prequalgies of Star Wars i think the special effects aren't quite as good as they could be and let it down a little for me, prefered the special effects in the original trilogy but I'd be wrong to say this film hasn't grown on me as I've watched it a number of times now"
"Mar 08, 2019",4.5,really good set of movies sequels don't get nearly as much love as they should.they're not perfect but they're way better than the Star wars movies were getting now.
"Mar 08, 2019",5,Perhaps the greatest movie of all time
"Mar 08, 2019",5,"I dont know why this movie get such hate, its so good"
"Mar 08, 2019",3.5,"Of the prequels, this is the one I will watch more often and enjoy."
"Mar 08, 2019",5,This is where the fun begins
"Mar 08, 2019",1,An overwrought mess of a movie.
"Mar 08, 2019",5,"Greatest movie ever, and not just cause the memes. I loved Anakin and Obi-Wan's relationship"
"Mar 08, 2019",5,The entire reason I made this review was to return balance to the force and repair the view rating to 66.
"Mar 06, 2019",5,A fine addition to my collection
"Mar 06, 2019",5,This is where the fun begins.
"Mar 06, 2019",4.5,This movie comes from the same breath as the mediocre prequels but feels like it came right out of the original trilogy.
"Mar 06, 2019",5,A masterpiece of film making and the fulcrum upon which the greatest film saga to date rests.
"Mar 06, 2019",5,better then the sequels
"Mar 06, 2019",5,"Amazing movie, overhated but amazing"
"Mar 06, 2019",5,"(sees the 65% audience score)
(visible confusion)"
"Mar 06, 2019",5,A suprise to be sure but a welcome one.
"Mar 06, 2019",5,"Despite the rocky start that the first two movies in the trilogy provided, Revenge of the Sith is an absolute masterpiece of film making and storytelling that perfectly bridges the prequel trilogy with the greater Star Wars lore. Best remembered due to it's numerous quotable lines and memorable action sequences, Revenge of the Sith is truly one of the few pieces of art that made it onto the big screen in the new corporate age of film making. 10/5 stars hands down."
"Mar 06, 2019",5,Underrated gem with a great story that ties up some loose ends that the originals left hanging. Also very memable
"Mar 06, 2019",5,"This is the best star wars since empire. A truly emotional and epic conclusion to the prequels, and, even tho it has it's problems, it's definitely an amazing movie"
"Mar 06, 2019",5,Meme classical film! This film is for not only the men but women and children too.
"Mar 06, 2019",4,"The most complete movie of the three Prequel Trilogy films, results in a very satisfying end to a series previously plagued by cheesy dialogue and cringy moments."
"Mar 06, 2019",5,Honestly one of the very best movies I've ever seen. The sheer creativity in worldbuilding makes this one an essential must-watch movie.
"Mar 06, 2019",5,always a fine choice for a movie night
"Mar 06, 2019",5,I love the star wars franchise and this is the best of them all
"Mar 06, 2019",5,The most comprehensive view of darth vader you will ever see: basically the one movie the entire star wars saga is set upon.
"Mar 06, 2019",5,It will be done my lord.
"Mar 06, 2019",5,"This is the best film I know. It tells of the fate of a corrupt state falling to fascism, the descent into darkness of a warrior and the conclusion of a destructive war"
"Mar 06, 2019",5,My favorite of the saga
"Mar 06, 2019",5,"Masterpiece.

"Mar 05, 2019",5,ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
"Mar 05, 2019",5,"It will be done, my lord."
"Mar 05, 2019",5,Best movie of all time
"Mar 04, 2019",5,Nice action and story line great acting
"Mar 04, 2019",3.5,"Revenge of the Sith is dark, fun and tragic culmination of the prequel trilogy. It might have poor dialogue, but, it still makes for an enjoyable and thrilling watch."
"Mar 03, 2019",4.5,Overall a really good film aside from a few cheesy lines and a bit of bad acting. Overall a satisfying end to the otherwise meh prequel trilogy. A great climax and an amazing final fight scene makes this film great
"Mar 03, 2019",5,Hello there. This is a perfect film. It's my favorite Star Wars movie. It has the most and the best Lightsaber duels by far. It is the biggest event in the entire saga. It also has the best and the most memes. There are so many great lines.
"Mar 02, 2019",4,my second fav starwars movie right after empire got a bad score in part because of how bad episode I was
"Mar 01, 2019",5,"My favorite in the Saga, very underrated film."
"Feb 27, 2019",3.5,"Revenge of the Sith wasnâ(TM)t afraid to set a darker tone and was more competently made than the previous, albeit the cheesy dialogue and acting."
"Feb 27, 2019",5,Definetly the best star wars movie so far
"Feb 27, 2019",5,"One of my all time favorite Star Wars films, great storytelling without any over powered or invincible characters. Highly recommend."
"Feb 27, 2019",0.5,These movies are boring.
"Feb 27, 2019",5,miles better than the last jedi. If you liked the last jedi this makes that movie look like the room by comparison
"Feb 26, 2019",1,"Way to ruin the original trilogy, George.  Can't introduce new generations to the series by showing them in chronological order because you fucked up the greatest reveal in cinematic history with that shit at the end of this film. =("
"Feb 26, 2019",4.5,"Easily the BEST Star Wars movie (until now), we see the transformation of Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader, breaking the heart fo his most loved ones to save them (or at least he thinked so), but in the process corrupting and surrendering to the Dark Side. It is filled with astounding action scenes, magnificent heart-breaking scenes and hard morale decisions."
"Feb 26, 2019",4.5,The 6th entry in the main Star Wars franchise continues the fresh ideas of the series.
"Feb 26, 2019",5,Now THIS is podracing! Best movie ever made. Do yourself a favor &amp; don't ever watch the Disney star movies except for rogue one.
"Feb 26, 2019",5,My fave Star Wars movie.
"Feb 25, 2019",5,"Best of the prequels. I love the atmosphere, the story and the editing. Everything falls into place perfectly.

Georges Lucas is a Genius. It's so unfortunate that Disney ruined everything."
"Feb 25, 2019",5,One of the best Star Wars movies ever.
"Feb 25, 2019",5,The second best starwars
"Feb 25, 2019",4,I miss when Star Wars was dark..
"Feb 24, 2019",5,Waaaaaaaay underrated.
"Feb 24, 2019",5,"A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one"
"Feb 24, 2019",5,Amazing star wars movie
"Feb 23, 2019",5,The best of the Prequel movies by far.
"Feb 22, 2019",5,Anakin vs Obi-wan is just awesome
"Feb 20, 2019",5,It's george lucas' star wars. What more to say.
"Feb 20, 2019",5,"Despite an abnormally low audience score due to falsified reviews (which is shown by the enormously unrealistic number of them), Episode III deserves accolades for its interesting characters, thoughtful plot, satisfying conflict and resolution, well planned structure, and its amazing visuals. Even its dialogue is improved from the other two prequels. The last good Star Wars movie made (with the exception of Rogue One), and my personal favorite, with the story George Lucas tells really coming to the heart of what Star Wars is and represents. This movie is everything Rian Johnson is not and will never be. This movie is at the heart of a franchise this miscreant cannot understand as he seems to be too much of an ignoramus to understand how to strucutre a plot of design a cohesive expanded universe. The Last Jedi is not only a bad Star Wars film, but a terrible movie. The Revenge of the Sith, in contrast, is both a good movie and an amazing addition to the Star Wars universe."
"Feb 19, 2019",5,The emotion in the last 20 minuets is breath taking. It has that feel that non of the previous two movies had
"Feb 19, 2019",4.5,This movie belongs to Emperor Palpatine.
"Feb 18, 2019",3,Action packed saved it
"Feb 18, 2019",5,Best Star Wars movie to date
"Feb 17, 2019",4.5,"The ending of the saga, and what an end. Almost perfect"
"Feb 17, 2019",4.5,one of the best star wars movies not as good as empire strikes back but still great watching sky walker become Vader.
"Feb 12, 2019",2.5,"As Lucas's last Star Wars film how does one rate this film today? Well sadly the dialogue and narrative continue to do nothing to engage you, still visually interesting and featuring satisfying action Revenge of the Sith concludes a flawed but fascinating legacy."
"Feb 11, 2019",5,"Lucas used too much CGI but I like this film, is my favorite star wars movie although is sad. The action I like it, I mean the lightsaber fights are great. Is a master piece."
"Feb 10, 2019",5,"Iï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)ve never watched a movie that left my mind blown as much as this one. The main antagonist starts making some good points at the end, and you can empathize with ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2the chosen oneï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? and his thought process through it all. The three dimensional characters that viewers can relate to made the movie very memorable, and the fact that the ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2good guysï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? and ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2bad guysï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? had some serious grey area for viewers to think about who they would have sided with in that situation made this movie amazing. I also like that they tied in events that happened in the preceding movies because it answered some of the questions I was left with after watching them. It also made me realize that the movies preceding this one (ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2The Phantom Menaceï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? and âThe Clone Warsâ?)were not just standalone movies that were good in their own way, but they were actually building up to the awesome climax that ended this film. After the movie I was left pondering the events leading up to the climax along with the main antagonistï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s reasons to reconsider who is ï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2goodï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â? and who is ï¿ 1/2 1/2  1/2badï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2 1/2ï¿ 1/2Â?.This movie sparked my love for the Star Wars universe, and is by far my favorite of all the Star Wars movies. All in all it was a real 10/10 movie in my book, and I hope the franchise can work some of the positive aspects of this movie into its future movies."
"Feb 10, 2019",4,"Despite some corny dialogue, this movie is the strongest in the prequels and one of the most emotional in the whole star wars saga, with a good runtime this installment is well done."
"Feb 08, 2019",4.5,"Revenge of the sith Brings the Star Wars prequels to a satisfying , yet a heartbreaking end with the origin of Darth Vader ."
"Feb 07, 2019",4,"great action scenes
pacing was good
acting was good
CGI and sound effects were amazing"
"Feb 06, 2019",2,What a flip! I'm good. (10 seconds later) I'm evil. Nope. There are some tolerable fan edits of the entire trilogy which smooth out the transition but not this movie. A shame.
"Feb 04, 2019",5,testing the tomatometer don't take this seriously
"Feb 04, 2019",5,"awesome movie, top 3 of best of star wars movies George Lucas I love you"
"Feb 01, 2019",5,"My favorite Star Wars. Tons of action, great story telling, nice execution of the lead to the next saga, and an amazing fun experience."
"Jan 29, 2019",3,"Not bad, but not exactly good. There were some parts I enjoyed and there were parts that I did not. The whole prequel trilogy was a story that did not have to be told. Which usually does not bother me considering I like the standalone Star Wars movies. When I rewatch Star Wars movies this is hardly ever the one I watch."
"Jan 27, 2019",3,"A huge improvement over the other prequels, but not something you go back to often."
"Jan 26, 2019",4,"This is my favorite Star Wars prequel movie. Better yet, one of my top three Star Wars movies. It's got the impactful emotion of how Darth Vader came to be and everything, but I just think they shouldn't have made Grievous some sissy general. The movie had so much potential with giving General Grievous a character, but ultimately, it did fail. It's still a great movie though."
"Jan 24, 2019",5,I really like it. Very exciting battles and the stakes are real. Even some heartbreaking parts that caught me by surprise.
"Jan 23, 2019",4.5,"I know it's a prequel, but it's the best one and very enjoyable."
"Jan 23, 2019",5,Best Star Wars movie out there
"Jan 23, 2019",5,You cannot defeat the High Ground
"Jan 23, 2019",4.5,"My second favourite star wars film, second to empire of course, definitely the best of the prequels and doesn't deserve such a low score."
"Jan 22, 2019",5,"best star WARS MOVIE, PERIOD."
"Jan 19, 2019",5,"Amazing movie, best of the prequel trilogy and is relatively a tie with The Empire Strikes Back. It takes everything the previous films were building toward and really delivered on the tragedy of Anakins fall to the dark side. How he did everything just to save his wife and how he felt betrayed by the Jedi. The large scale visuals were fantastic and characters were all interesting.  Did a great job giving us a story arc that leads into the story of the originals and makes us think of Vader in a whole new fashion. How Palpatine became the emperor from his manipulation and how the Jedi were wiped out. Simply incredible story, and couldnï¿ 1/2(TM)t have been as good without the build up of the previous 2 films."
"Jan 18, 2019",5,"People like to say ""Empire Strikes Back"" is the darkest and best film of the saga, but I would dare to say ""Revenge of the Sith"" manages to be even more sinister and terrifying, as well as  a tad bit more exciting."
"Jan 16, 2019",3.5,I actually prefer clone wars for world building. This is a better script. All of these prequels feel like they could be combined like the hobbit should have been.  I like them but I know they aren't very good. Childhood nostalgia and world building must be a lot of the reason. The use of cgi is fun and world building at least for me.
"Jan 15, 2019",5,"Fantastic movie, the best Star Wars movie ever as far as I am concerned. Anakin becomes Darth Vader. Luke is born. The Emperor at his best, This movie has it all including the best lightsaber battle ever between Ob-Wan and Anakin. I have watched it countless times"
"Jan 13, 2019",4.5,"George Lucus gives what STAR WARS fans have wanted since the beginning: the story of the tragic fall of Anakin Skywalker, the rise of the powerful Darth Sidious, and a riveting conclusion to the STAR WARS saga. REVENGE OF THE SITH hits the mark!"
"Jan 12, 2019",4.5,"Gets better on subsequent viewings. Main weakness are some stilted dialogue and acting, but overall does an excellent job of wrapping up the trilogy and setting the tone for the next movie to occur chronologically."
"Jan 09, 2019",4.5,The mythological themes of good vs evil and liberty vs tyranny are incredible.
"Jan 08, 2019",5,"Quite epic, at least didnt do strange things like yoda in the VIII film"
"Jan 07, 2019",4,Better than TLJ and solo and the remake of a new hope aka force awakens
"Jan 06, 2019",2,It was OK.  Again I can't help but think that George Lucas plan for Darth Jar Jar would have been epic.
"Jan 06, 2019",4,"Highly poignant and brilliant in its plot, this movie is one of the best Star Wars movies to date, though there is still room for improvement. The dialogue is less wooden than its previous counterparts, though still unrealistic for the most part, though highly memeable. I was highly disappointed with the depiction of Padme, a strong female heroine who was reduced to barefoot and pregnant in this movie with a rushed death that, in retrospect, was brilliant, but was not at all explained. It also frustrates me how she had to die for Anakin to have his character change. On a positive note, the portrays of Palpatine/Sidious by Ian McDiarmid, and Obi-Wan by Ewan McGregor were excellent. Additionally, the last fight between two of the main characters was undeniably the best fight in the Star Wars saga: beautifully choreographed, portraying how even the closest of friends can turn from brothers to enemies."
"Jan 05, 2019",5,I love the part where theres sand and stuff lol yeah

"Jan 05, 2019",5,"It concludes a trilogy that many may not appreciate, but it's a tragedy and a story of peace, justice and security."
"Jan 05, 2019",5,Absolutely amazing 66/66
"Jan 05, 2019",5,"Hello there! Seeing that this film had such a low audience was a surprise, but not a welcome one. However knowing that this will start to rise, this is where the fun begins."
"Jan 05, 2019",5,The one of the best star wars movies and the best Prequel movie.
"Jan 05, 2019",5,realy good movie ewan on his a game. prequel memes
"Jan 05, 2019",5,Big Man says this is the best movie ever! 5/5
"Jan 05, 2019",5,"Hello there! Even if this movie is considered bad and it had many flaws, it's still a gem compared to the Disney trash, namely TLJ. The lightsaber duels are amazingly choreographed and the movie respects the general in-universe lore (unlike the sequel trilogy) and does not feel like a blatant cashgrab. Also the meme factor and the fact that this movie has the cheesy feeling to it makes it worth a watch in my eyes.

"Jan 03, 2019",5,My favourite Star Wars movie of all times &lt;3
"Jan 03, 2019",4.5,"It's surely underrated, and is a overall great Star Wars movie, despite some problems."
"Jan 02, 2019",4.5,"With out a doubt this is the best prequel movie, some would argue that this is the best star wars movie."
"Jan 01, 2019",4,"Although the acting and CGI isn’t the best we’ve seen, I still believe this is the most fun and most watchable Star Wars movie ever made. I can watch this movie over and over and still feel all the emotions that I felt during my first time watching the film. The character of Anakin goes through a troubling time so of course he’s going to be an emotional wreck throughout all the prequel movies. I don’t think the character of Anakin was written bad, I just think the way Hayden portrayed this character could’ve definitely been better. As for Padme, I think that her love with Anakin was a bit corny at times and could’ve done without some of those scenes. Obi-Wan, Grievous, and Palpatine to me were perfect and they were all played by amazing actors and I couldn’t see any other actors playing theses characters for me unlike Anakin and Padme. In my opinion, I can get over the bad CGI and dialogue and enjoy the story of the fall of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of the Empire and Darth Vader. At the end of the day this is just an opinion and enjoy what you want and dislike what you want. I in no way want to change your opinion, but I do want to make all sides heard. Thanks for reading :)"

"Dec 31, 2018",3.5,A lot of lightsabers! epic. Too much CGI. I really felt the emotion in Obi-wan and Anakin.
"Dec 31, 2018",4,Legendary and  a lot better than 1&amp;2
"Dec 29, 2018",5,A real return to top form
"Dec 28, 2018",4.5,Honestly not as bad as people say it is
"Dec 28, 2018",4.5,A triumph as far as how much ground had to be made up for ep I and II. Thrilling and amazing from beginning to end for me. As good as a New Hope for me personally.
"Dec 27, 2018",3.5,"The best of the prequels. No question. Although it still had some laughable dialogue and wooden acting at times, this was a much more enjoyable ride. Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid completely one the roles of Obi-Wan and the Emperor. The action was pretty too notch. Even though I’m not a huge fan of Yoda with a lightsaber, it still was cool to see him take on the Emperor. Hayden Christensen is also much better here than he was in the last movie. Thanks George Lucas you ended on a high note. "
"Dec 25, 2018",4,"For me this film failed in one of its most important story goals - explaining Anakin's turn to the dark side in a manner consistent with that described by Obi Wan in the first Star Wars.  Rather than being ""seduced"" by the dark side, it looked more like he was driven mad with worry over an uncertain future and an inability to control his emotions.  His descent from Jedi Hero to child-killing monster happened so rapidly that we didn't quite have time to fully grasp what was going on..  This gripe aside, ROTS was an amazingly exciting film to watch, with some great moments that have since become cornerstones of Star Wars legend.  I wish the sequel trilogy was up to this standard."
"Dec 25, 2018",4.5,"While it has some weird dialogue and bounces back and forth with wipes, it is my favorite of the Star Wars movies and shows how a movie can balance emotion and action in such a great way. "
"Dec 19, 2018",4.5,Best of the prequels and 2nd best SW movie to Empire. 
"Dec 18, 2018",5,The film is action packed with thrilling and exiting duels and a overall good and emotional story...George Lucas really outdid this one.
"Dec 17, 2018",5,"I honestly don't get what people have against the prequels, if you saw my previous star wars review i said i love star wars 1-6 flawlessly, revenge of the  sith is my all time favorite star wars movie and i love how  george lucas was not afraid to go dark with this film, this film just like star wars 1-6, gets 5 out of 5 stars, this film blew me away"
"Dec 16, 2018",4.5,"A great film that has been used to create many memes and will continue to be one of the greatest films of all time, execute order 66"
"Dec 16, 2018",2.5,"Jedi escape the impossible in Episode III, with special effects so elaborate and busy I could take three extra hours just pausing and looking over the details of every scene. But this is it. The prequels' conclusion for what it's worth. And it is an exciting ending. The glorious rise of Emporer Palpatine."
"Dec 12, 2018",5,It's treason then.
"Dec 11, 2018",3,"Finally, this is how the movie is done. Not the best Star Wars film but it is the best of the prequel trilogy."
"Dec 10, 2018",4.5,"This movie isnâ(TM)t perfect by any means, however it still makes for a great watch. Episode III redeems the bumpy start the prequels had. Two great fight scenes and a lot of important story telling.  A lot of people like to bash the prequels, but Iâ(TM)d like to put my 2 cents out there, give credit where itâ(TM)s due, and say that itâ(TM)s definitely worth watching!"
"Dec 10, 2018",5,A well made ending to the otherwise bumpy prequel trilogy.The Force was strong with this one.
"Dec 09, 2018",3,best in the prequil trilogy but alot of the acting was terrible
"Dec 06, 2018",4.5,"A Very Tense, Emotional, Long Awaited Prequel"
"Dec 05, 2018",4,"Revenge of the Sith becomes a suitable film to finish a great saga, where the story is strong and moving, with exceptional battles and a well developed plot, despite having a few weak moments."
"Dec 02, 2018",4,"In context, it fits perfectly and is easily the best prequel. Perhaps on par with Return of the Jedi for me."
"Dec 02, 2018",4,"The current greatest Star Wars prequel, and the best of the prequel trilogy"
"Dec 01, 2018",2,Nothing to add here.
"Dec 01, 2018",2.5,"Many fans and critics seemed to have hopped on board with this final installment of George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequels. I believe more than a few simply convinced themselves of the film's greatness due to Anakin's transition to Darth Vader, and I will admit, the final half hour indeed delivers the goods and reminds us all why we fell in love with ""Star Wars"" to begin with. But, I can't remain oblivious to Lucas' lack of skill when it comes to dialogue, character development and providing a soul to his story. Overall, it provides a lot more than ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" though that's not saying much. However, when it comes to reaching the level of greatness that Lucas once did with his original trilogy, it pales in comparison."
"Nov 29, 2018",4,Best movie of all time
"Nov 27, 2018",4.5,"After the colossal disappointments that were the previous two films in the prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith brings a significantly darker tone, perhaps the darkest Star Wars have ever seen, and I can find few flaws in the movie. It really does build up to the original trilogy's plot quite well, and offers a very satisfying yet incredible payoff for the series. It really does a lot to build the Star Wars universe. One cannot also understate the lightsaber duels in this movie, easily being some of the best. I even want to mention the soundtrack, particularly the backdrop to Order 66, which really adds a lot to the scene, and even on several re-watches is still haunting and lovely. The criticisms I would level at this film would primarily revolve around the continued love narrative between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman, which fails to add much to the story and still fails to come across as even remotely sincere. In addition, Jar Jar Binks remains, for some reason, although his involvement is incredibly minimal, thankfully. These negatives can be easily overlooked however, and I would consider this to be on the same level as Empire Strikes Back, the best of Star Wars."
"Nov 27, 2018",3,Best of the prequels
"Nov 23, 2018",4,"I enjoy Revenge of the Sith  as much as, if not, more than Return of the Jedi. I find it to be a very underrated movie, even with all of its flaws. This movie has great action, a great (but occasionally cheesy) story about Anakin's turn to the dark side. This movie also benefits from great action and some of the best soundtrack in the series. Sure, the movie does suffer from Hayden Christiansen's cheesy acting, and certain aspects of the movie could be better, but I think it's a great way to conclude the somewhat disappointing prequel trilogy. Revenge of the Sith is good, but not great. It gets a 7/10."
"Nov 23, 2018",3,Although I hate the prequel trilogy if I had to pick a favorite it would be this one. Ill say 65
"Nov 22, 2018",5,My favorite Star Wars movie!
"Nov 21, 2018",4,"While the CGI and script leave much to be desired, this was actually a good movie, especially when compared to the disney garbage."
"Nov 19, 2018",2.5,"It got some great action scenes but the overall plot is not very compelling at all, and the reason Anakin turns to the dark side just does not work, also it takes to fast. And as well there are some terrible moments as well as Hayden Christensen does not do a good job with portraying Anakin."
"Nov 19, 2018",4.5,Imperfect but thoroughly enjoyable. This is suitably dark with epic action and some great dramatic scenes. There are a few bits which could have been done better but overall this is a great success.
"Nov 18, 2018",2.5,This film was almost good.
"Nov 16, 2018",5,The best prequels movie is the second best STAR WARS movie and my favorite movie.
"Nov 15, 2018",4.5,This movie just gets better over time.  Since i fall into the OT group by age this is by far my most favorite of the prequels better than  most of the other Star wars movies.  If you are having issue with Episode 1 or 2 this one will make it worth the pain
"Nov 14, 2018",5,The birth of Darth Vader was very awesome
"Nov 13, 2018",1,"People claim this is the ""good"" star wars prequel. Well I have a hard time believing that the other 2 can be as bad as this and at this point I'm too afraid to find out."
"Nov 13, 2018",3.5,"Il meno peggio della trilogia prequel, ma questo non vuol dire che sia un bel film. Ma neanche totalmente brutto. Ha i suoi momenti, come delle divertenti scene d'azione e qualche dialogo incredibilmente ispirato, per essere lo stesso film che contiene lo scambio di battute: ""Sei bellissima"" ""È perché sono molto innamorata"". Già... purtroppo i dialoghi e le scene cringe non mancano neanche in questo terzo e fortunatamente ultimo episodio prequel, così come non mancano la piattezza della maggior parte dei personaggi, la storia noiosa, raffazzonata e difficile da seguire e tutti gli altri elementi che ci hanno fatto odiare i due precedenti abomini della trilogia. In sostanza, questo film riesce tutto sommato a risultare godibile, merito soprattutto del finale, che si ricollega finalmente alla trilogia storica nel modo più epico ed enfatizzato possibile, anche se, anche qui, non mancano le classiche cappellate alla Lucas, come il famigerato ""nooooo"""" urlato da Anakin/Darth Vader, o la morte più stupida dell'intera saga (chi ha visto il film sa a quale personaggio mi riferisco). Insomma, definite questo episodio III un bel film è forse troppo, ma può quantomeno risultare quello che ep. I e II non erano e non saranno mai: intrattenimento senza pretese."
"Nov 12, 2018",4.5,Revenge of the Sith is my favorite star wars film.  Hayden Christensen is once again great in star wars and cool action scenes make this movie awesome
"Nov 11, 2018",5,"The dialogue may have been bad, but overall this movie is entertaining, rewatchable, and tells a great story, even if it had to get through a lot of details in a rather small amount of time. This is the darkest and most emotional Star Wars film, which works well here. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is amazing here in my opinion, which helped as well. This is a very enjoyable film, a huge improvement from the previous two movies."
"Nov 11, 2018",5,There isn't a better movie anywhere anytime ever. This is the one.
"Nov 11, 2018",4,Out of the Prequels easily the best. But had its flaws. Most people give prequels a bad name but if the 2 prior was like this one then they would be better.
"Nov 10, 2018",2,"Wow. Just wow. Star Wars has done the impossible. They have actually ruined movies. The hype on these things was a lesson to all audience members; you don't always get what you wish for.

To be honest , I don't know who was still watching these things. After the first 2, it was only going to get worse. But it got slightly better. This movie had a direction, and an actual plot, something that you want in your big blockbuster franchise. And to be honest, at one time, this was actually my favorite Star Wars movie. But, watching it over again, I now realize where it lost its footing. A horrible script really drove this movie into the ground. As for any other complaints for this movie: Hayden Christiansen."
"Nov 09, 2018",4,The best episode of the original trilogy
"Nov 06, 2018",5,"An amazing conclusion to the series. As far as im concerned this IS the last star wars film released since Disney made the franchise garbage.

Love the tragedy of darth plaguis the wise as well as see anakin transform into vader.

The musical scores are brilliant and the fights are amazing and epic"
"Nov 06, 2018",5,la unica buena de las precuelas
"Nov 05, 2018",5,"Loved it, best star wars from the prequels"
"Nov 05, 2018",3,"The memes are good, the story not so much."
"Nov 04, 2018",5,It was a surprise to be sure but a welcome one when I found out that this movie had so many great moments and happy landings. The tragedy of Anakin and Darth Plagueis was wonderful with the depth and lore it added to the franchise. This movie has the high ground above all the other prequels and is always there to say hello there when Im looking for something to watch
"Nov 03, 2018",5,"It's a great movie, this movie is before the clone wars series (3D), so it shows us some part of that war between droids and clones, that is something characteristic of this saga. And also it has the greatest fight.  Anakin vs Obi-Wan so far the best even counting the news movies of Disney."
"Nov 01, 2018",3.5,"The birth of Darth Vader concludes the trilogy as a bombastic interstellar opera.
On renewed viewing I still think that Anakin Skywalker's metamorphosis to Darth Vader a bit unconvincing; much of the fun comes from the supporting characters and diverse aliens."
"Oct 30, 2018",4,Best of the prequels
"Oct 29, 2018",4,"Even though Hayden Christensen is given the worst dialogue and direction possible, the rest of Revenge of the Sith actually feels like a Star Wars movie.

Visual storytelling, a good mythos, and possibly the greatest lightsaber fight at the end make the film an enjoyable watch.

8/10"
"Oct 27, 2018",4,"Of the prequel trilogy, this is the film that most matches the emotion and force filled action of the originals."
"Oct 27, 2018",5,Best movie ever made
"Oct 26, 2018",5,My favorite Star Wars movie by far
"Oct 26, 2018",5,Very underrated my personal favorite movie of star wars
"Oct 25, 2018",5,I liked the clone wars part of this movie. And of course the memes! Anakin may have been annoying but at least he got what's coming to him in the end! And again they aren't just re using old plot lines! Sad that it even has to be mentioned. 
"Oct 23, 2018",4.5,"The best reviewed prequel in the franchise for over ten years and rightfully so, ""Revenge of the Sith"" still suffers from the occasional poor dialogue and plot hole. But Lucas gives it his all in terms of visual storytelling and delivers a satisfying conclusion to the Republic. John Williams gives his best score since ""Empire..."" and Ben Burtt's sound design gets two big thumbs up. Revisit it soon if you haven't seen it in a while, it's likely better than you remembered it."
"Oct 22, 2018",3.5,The only prequel that is actually good besides (technically) Rogue One
"Oct 22, 2018",1.5,"Definitely not as good as any of the Star Wars films. We all kinda hoped the prequel trilogy itself was already just erased from the Star Wars universe. Nobody is more of a pity than Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker. Leave it to the real jedi, Luke. I actually want these films to be remade. The film itself isn’t very bad, but the everything it contains is just horrible and last generation CGI. "
"Oct 21, 2018",5,The Best movie of the saga and One of my favorites in general
"Oct 21, 2018",4,Best of the prequel trilogy.
"Oct 15, 2018",4.5,One of my favourite Star Wars films. Prequel or not I don't care. Growing up during the prequels this was my favourite movie.
"Oct 14, 2018",4,"A great conclusion to the rocky Star Wars prequels, is it perfect? Far from it. Anakin's turn feels fast in this film, understandably so as George Lucas only had one film to make a character take a major change in character from conflicted and emotional to murdering Sith Lord. Being critical and taking nostalgia out of the equation as much as possible for someone who grew up with the prequels as well as the original Star Wars movies I think this is critically the best of the Star Wars prequels."
"Oct 12, 2018",5,Best Star Wars prequel movie. The fall of Anakin Skywalker. Classic ending.
"Oct 11, 2018",5,"this is by far the best way to experince the prequels
You underistame my memes"
"Oct 10, 2018",5,In my top 5 favorite films list.
"Oct 08, 2018",5,Liking just for the memes.
"Oct 08, 2018",2,"Highly overrated film. For so many years ever since I was a 9-year-old kid, I loved this movie, but after watching Mr. Plinkett's review video of this movie on YouTube, I realize that this movie is actually bad. All of the characters in this movie are dumb, except for Darth Sidious/Palpatine. All the characters (except Palpatine) lack cohesive thoughts. The only reason I gave this a three star rating instead of a two and a half star rating is because Jar Jar Binks is barely in the movie, John Williams' amazing soundtrack, the entertaining action scenes, the attempt at emotional scenes, Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, and the movie just being fun (but that's it, it's just a fun movie, not a good movie). The CGI has not aged well. There is still too much overuse of CGI. The acting (mainly from Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman) is a lot worse than I remembered. The Star Wars prequels are poorly made, poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted, and poorly executed films. There are big continuity errors in this movie. Anakin wasn't seduced by the dark side, he was tricked into going to the dark side. In A New Hope, Obi-Wan said that Vader was seduced by the dark side. In Return of the Jedi, Leia told Luke that she remembered her birth mother and said that she was always sad. In Revenge of the Sith, after Padme gave birth to the twins Luke and Leia, she died a few seconds later with no explanation whatsoever. There is no logical way Leia could've remembered that. The Mace Windu vs. Palpatine lightsaber duel scene was badly choreographed and laughable. Darth Sidious should not have used a lightsaber in this movie. In Episode VI, he referred to a lightsaber as ""a Jedi's weapon"". That scene was so unintentionally hilarious that it looked like a parody/comedy. That fight scene was so stupid that it spawned so many memes. The acting and dialogue was so laughably bad that a bunch of the lines from that scene became memes. Mace Windu brought three Jedi Masters with him but all three of them got taken out so quickly and easily. The Jedi purge scene could've been emotional and great if we had known at least a few of the Jedi who died. None of them had any character development, so it was hard to feel any emotion when they died during the Order 66 scene. I know a lot of people are going to say that you have to watch The Clone Wars show to get emotionally invested in those characters, but if I have to watch a TV show to understand a movie and to feel emotions for the characters, then the movie fails. Movies need to stand on their own. I shouldn't have to rely on the lore to understand the prequels or any movie for that matter. The Star Wars prequels rely too much on the lore and The Clone Wars show for things that are never explained in the movies. It's been so many years since I watched Star Wars: The Clone Wars, so I can't remember any of the Jedi who died and can't get emotionally invested with the characters. Another huge problem with the Jedi purge/Order 66 scene is that it used far too much CGI and the visual effects did not even age well at all. Some parts of the scene literally looked like a video game cutscene. Obi-Wan said too many cheesy one-liners and some of them didn't even make sense. The dialogue in Episode III is still terrible and awkward like the previous prequels. Anakin and Obi-Wan's lightsaber duel with each other in the third act on Mustafar was ridiculously overchoreographed. The final battle went for too long and it kind of mostly feels like it was just them showing off their cool moves and stunts rather than having a realistic and emotional final battle. Also a lot of the acting (mainly from Christensen and Portman, but mostly Christensen) and dialogue (especially from Anakin) on Mustafar was so horrible that it was laughable and unintentionally hilarious. I felt like I was watching a comedy instead of a serious action/space opera film. And Darth Vader screaming ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"" at the end was extremely overdramatic and corny. Episode III ruined Darth Vader. Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is definitely the best and most watchable of the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy, but it is still a pretty bad film. I can only now see this film as a guilty pleasure. Hence why I gave it a three star rating.

Rating: 4.8/10"
"Oct 08, 2018",5,"Probably the darkest chapter in the Star Wars saga yet, Revenge of the Sith makes up  for the previous two Star Wars movies' failures."
"Oct 05, 2018",3.5,"After two disappointing previous instalments, the Star Wars prequel trilogy finally gave us a satisfying film. It still has a lot of the same issues as the first two - some of the dialogue is pretty poor, and Hayden Christensen still isn't convincing as Anakin - but the pacing is considerably improved, the plot is more focused and engaging, and the action scenes (especially Obi-Wan vs Anakin) are well-done. Not the best in the series, but still a solid film."
"Oct 04, 2018",4.5,This is the story Lucas wanted to tell at the start and it is the story the fans wanted to see.
"Oct 04, 2018",5,The best of the prequels
"Oct 02, 2018",3.5,"One of the best of the prequel trilogy, action scenes were a little over the top."
"Sep 30, 2018",5,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars movie in the prequel trilogy. George Lucas finally brings us the Star Wars Story that fans have been waiting for since 1977 when A New Hope was released. Three years into the Clone Wars, the Jedi rescue Palpatine from Count Dooku. As Obi-wan pursues a new threat, Anakin acts as a double agent between the Jedi Council and Palpatine and is lured into a sinister plan to rule the galaxy.

 The film builds us tension really well and that makes it better. It has the best action scenes in the prequels because the final fight between Anakin Obi-Wan was brilliant. My only problem with this movie is that Hayden Christensen acting is terrible but the acting is redeemed with a terrific performance by Ian Mcdiarmid. The ending of the film is my favourite scene because it is the most emotional scene in the film. It is probably the most emotional Star Wars film and is also the most enjoyable prequel for the entire family to enjoy.  George Lucas has directed the star wars saga very well and now he has drawn it to at close with this astounding film.

Grade A+"
"Sep 29, 2018",1.5,"Revenge of the Sith is, what I consider to be, the least bad of the prequel films.

The lesser of three evils, if you will.

My opinion is probably based on the fact that I enjoy dark, adult-themed movies. Revenge of the Sith is definitely a step in that direction, although it does feel extremely contrived at times.

My biggest issue with this film is that Anakin's (Hayden Christensen) turn to the Dark Side feels forced and unconvincing. I know that Lucas was attempting something meaningful when Anakin ended up being the death of Padme (Natalie Portman), but it just doesn't work.

As with the previous two films, Revenge of the Sith is plagued with atrocious writing and horrible performances. Ian McDiarmid, who had previously been the constant bright spot in terms of acting, devolves into laughable overacting.

As I was beginning to write this review, I realized that I couldn't remember a single thing about the first half of the film. I had just finished watching it. The plot with General Grievous was so uninteresting and dumb that my memory had decided to purge itself.

A coughing robot with functioning organs? What?

I mean, Jar Jar Binks is still the worst character in the trilogy, but Grievous comes close.

Honestly, one of the things that bothers me most about the whole horrible prequel trilogy is the character of Padme. She's a Queen and, later, a Senator... and yet she is written to be completely useless. She has no agency of her own. Her entire story is focused on her infatuation with Anakin. She can't even survive childbirth, because she's so heartbroken about him.

This from the same man who wrote the character of Leia Organa.

Really, George? Really?"
"Sep 27, 2018",5,One word: masterpiece
"Sep 27, 2018",4.5,Anakin's fall to the darkside is executed very well. This movie is dark and emotional and has the best score in the saga. This movie is a satisfying epic conclusion to the series and has amazing action sequences. Hayden Christensen's performance is also excellent.
"Sep 27, 2018",3.5,"The best of the first 3 parts of this trilogy. Yet still not on par with the original 3. Still, its above allot of the sci fi movies of recent years and worth watching,"
"Sep 25, 2018",3,Easily the best of the prequel trilogy but fails to attain the magic of the original trilogy.
"Sep 22, 2018",3.5,An entertaining conclusion to the prequel trilogy.
"Sep 21, 2018",5,This movie is the best of the prequel trilogy most people don't like this movie just because of the first twos mistakes but it's one of the best Star Wars films to date better than the sequel trilogy so far anakins transition from hero to villain is very well made I'd give it a 6/5 if I could :)
"Sep 20, 2018",5,"By far my favorite Star Wars installment! Very moving plot. Enchanting visuals, hands down a great Star Wars experience!!"
"Sep 17, 2018",4,Easily the best of the prequels. This was the movie I wanted after the original  trilogy.
"Sep 17, 2018",3.5,"The one good movie in the Star Wars prequel trilogy that sees the origin of Darth Vader finally come full circle, and delivers in some exciting light saber battles."
"Sep 17, 2018",5,"The best prequel by far, and definitely better than the sequels. Has some of the best lightsaber duels in the whole franchise, and the Order 66 sequence is one of the best scenes in the whole franchise."
"Sep 10, 2018",3.5,"While it still suffers from some of the problems of the previous two, Revenge of the Sith is a massive improvement over its predecessors and is the perfect lead-in to the original Star Wars."
"Sep 07, 2018",5,"Underrated, its a lovely emoitional star wars movie. Best prequel.
Better then the sequels."
"Sep 05, 2018",4.5,The best of the prequels
"Sep 04, 2018",5,THE MOST CHALLENGING EMOTIONAL ROLLER-COASTER
"Sep 02, 2018",3.5,Best prequel. Best opening in a prequel. Best Palpatine scene in a prequel.
"Aug 31, 2018",4,"Dark and engaging, Revenge of the Sith a good way to wrap up the Star Wars prequels."
"Aug 31, 2018",4,"A beautiful, dramatic ending to the prequel trilogy, drawing on the strengths of the last one. Although still held back from some wooden acting."
"Aug 27, 2018",3.5,The best of the prequels.
"Aug 23, 2018",5,i miss the real starwars
"Aug 20, 2018",4,Good bad Anakin pass very fast to the dark side 
"Aug 20, 2018",0.5,THIS IS A GARBAGE MOVE WITH NO REDEEMING QUALITIES!
"Aug 20, 2018",4,"Star Wars 3 ist so viel besser als 1 und 2. Die Bilder die von George Lucas ausgedrückt werden sind bedrückend, die Schauplätze funktionieren Prima als Metapher. Dennoch leidet der Film an uninteressanten Dialogen und an Haydn Christensen's Schauspiel. Dennoch sind alle anderen Schau und Story Elemente sehr solide und arbeiten gut miteinander. Trotz der nicht ganz nach vollziehbaren Charakterentwicklung von Anikan ist der Film durchaus solide und landet daher im Bereich eines guten Blockbusters"
"Aug 12, 2018",5,This movie is amazing and is much better than that shit you call the sequel trilogy
"Aug 12, 2018",3.5,This movie is far better than it's fellow prequel movies. The acting improved greatly in this as well as the feeling of actually watching a Star Wars movie. Definitely the movie to watch if you're tired of watching the Original Trilogy all the time.
"Aug 11, 2018",5,"This is honestly my favorite Star Wars movie, with the best opening to any star wars movie by far, as well as good character development. It also shows how Palpatine finally establishes his first Galactic Empire."
"Aug 09, 2018",5,i’m my opinion this movie is very underrated 
"Aug 09, 2018",5,"Lucas demostró que no todas sus precuelas son malas, con diálogos épicos, personajes y luchas épicas esta es fácilmente la segunda mejor película de STAR WARS."
"Aug 07, 2018",5,Best star wars movie...
"Aug 04, 2018",5,The Best Star Wars movie to date
"Aug 03, 2018",5,"Hands down the BEST space ship battle in all of Star Wars, possibly all a Sci-fi. The cheese does detract from the plot connections Lucas painstakingly tried to imply here, but there are at least several jaw dropping moments where we are transported to 1977-1981-1983 original trilogy glory. Ewan McGregor nails his Obi Wan role with an honest tortured protagonist role, Hayden Christensen acts leaps and bounds better than his last attempt, and Ian McDiarmid CRUSHES the understated villain role. 
Although I'm an original Trilogy era fan...I hold episode III above episode VI because the Ewoks were a huge plot hole and unbelievable. Revenge of the Sith is a fine swan song for the prequel trilogy!"
"Aug 02, 2018",4.5,Best prequel movie and one of the best in the Saga. Shows us more of the transformation of Anakin to Vader and the fall of the republic. Underrated
"Jul 30, 2018",2.5,"The only ""good"" prequel, Revenge of the Sith improves on performances and writing, but still can't make up for the performance of Christensen, the bizarre costume design, or George Lucas's attempts at emotional dialogue"
"Jul 29, 2018",4,Favorite movie in the franchise. Saved the prequels
"Jul 29, 2018",4.5,The last 2 prequels are ok but this one really gets good.
"Jul 28, 2018",3.5,A good movie but not too special. The best of the prequels.
"Jul 28, 2018",5,"Best scene in the entire Star Wars franchise:

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

"Jul 27, 2018",5,I come from r/prequelmemes with great news.
"Jul 25, 2018",3.5,"I have a friend who holds Revenge of the Sith in extremely high regard - it is his favorite film, above such classics as Casablanca and Citizen Kane. While I don't agree with him, I respect his choice far more than if he chose The Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones. Revenge of the Sith is a deeply flawed movie. It is also a fun movie to watch. While it is held back by bad writing and Hayden Christensen's poor performance as Anakin Skywalker, Revenge of the Sith is by far the best of the Star Wars prequels.

Revenge of the Sith immediately shows more promise than either of the other prequels. The opening space battle is impressive in sheer scale, featuring dozens of ships on either side, more than any other battle depicted in canon. During brief pauses in this action, the movie wisely develops the relationship between Anakin and Obi Wan. In Attack of the Clones, the relationship between master and apprentice comes off as antagonistic, with Anakin constantly grousing about Obi Wan to Padme. In contrast, the opening scenes of Revenge of the Sith depict Anakin and Obi Wan engaged in playful banter, better fitting the relationship alluded to by Obi Wan in A New Hope.

Sadly, while the relationship between Anakin and Obi Wan is better written, the writing is not universally good. At one point, Obi Wan unintentionally declares himself a Sith lord, stating ""only the Sith deal in absolutes"". The dialogue between Anakin and Padme, while less uncomfortable than in the previous film, is also bad. This is unfortunate given the major role that Anakin's protectiveness toward Padme arising from this relationship motivates his character. This suspect writing infects one of the major plot developments: a major character dies from losing ""the will to live"", which strikes me as lazy and melodramatic writing.

On the other hand, there are some good lines in the film, such as, ""So this is how liberty dies...with thunderous applause"". While most of the characters have some good dialogue (the aforementioned line was said by Padme) the bulk of the film's best lines are given to the film's two strongest performers - Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. Ewan McGregor's performance was one of the few good parts of Attack of the Clones, and he remains a breath of fresh air. As for Ian McDiarmid, he steals every scene he is in, transitioning between soft spoken intelligence, quiet menace, and cartoonish villainy with ease. Sadly, Hayden Christensen's performance still drags the movie down, but even his acting is improved from Episode II.

Any review of Revenge of the Sith would be incomplete without mention of the final lightsaber duel. Set on the lava planet Mustafar, its hellish landscape not only mirrors the personal hell into which the villain has fallen but provides an interesting backdrop for the lethal contest. It is also the longest lightsaber duel in all of Star Wars and is meticulously choreographed. Although I didn't enjoy the scene quite as much as the duel at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, which has less eye candy but a greater emotional weight, the spectacle of a lightsaber duel on this scale elevates it beyond any of the other duels depicted in the franchise.

Revenge of the Sith had the potential be a great movie - the tragic story of the start of darkness of one of the most iconic antagonists in popular cinema. While it doesn't quite achieve its potential, largely due to George Lucas' writing and Hayden Christensen's acting, it does manage to be a far more entertaining film than either of the other prequels. I was forced to rewatch the prequel in order to better review them. Episodes I and II were a slog. Episode III, on the other hand, was a legitimately fun way to occupy two hours. Star Wars movies are, at their best, fantastical but emotionally relatable entertainment. Revenge of this Sith manages to entertain while successfully investing the audience in the characters. Perhaps the emotional investment would be greater if the writing was better, but Revenge of the Sith succeeds by the standards of the franchise."
"Jul 25, 2018",2.5,I didn't like this movie at all.
"Jul 25, 2018",4,"This is the most original and overall best of the prequel Star Wars movies.
-7.5/10"
"Jul 23, 2018",5,"This is a stronger story line than episode one however not as pivotal  as it should be in the saga. George Screwed the pooch by making Anikan  too much of a whinny little  ninny  and by the end of this one a person is just glad to see him  put on the black half robot suite. Personally Think Ani should have been writen as a happy camper through out the first 3 movies. And only turned to the dark side of the force after Obi-wan accidentally mortally wounded Padme in a failed rescue attempt of some sort. Padme should have died on the operation table after an emergency C-section to save her twins.
Hayden gets too much flack for his performance if you take the time to watch the behind the scenes making of the film you can clearly see George calling the shots straight from the script . Hayden and others had very little opportunity for making any important suggestions."
"Jul 22, 2018",2.5,"Dark as it should be, mercifully ended the prequels."
"Jul 21, 2018",5,Second best Star Wars in my opinion.
"Jul 18, 2018",4,The only good star wars prequel
"Jul 18, 2018",5,"This is my third favorite Star wars movie behind Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, and I know, you're probably already judging me. Everyone hates on Christensen, but he did well considering what the characters life was actually like, especially in this movie. And no, I don't just love this movie for the memes, although, hello there, did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth plagueis the wise? That's outrageous, it's unfair. Love won't save you, only my new powers can do that."
"Jul 16, 2018",5,PADME DIED BECAUSE SHE LOST THE WILL TO LIVE LIKE WHAT THE HELL THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE LUKE SKYWALKERS MUM WHAT A JOKE YET IM STILL GONNA GIVE IT 5 STAR BECAUSE OF THAT SUPER COOL WOOKIE BATTLE HELL YEH
"Jul 15, 2018",5,Yes yes yes I love this movie I could watch it so many times!
"Jul 15, 2018",5,Don’t try it. I have the high ground!
"Jul 14, 2018",3.5,"While I strongly believe that the prequels will never be as good as the originals, I do believe that Revenge of the Sith was the strongest of those three movies. Given the complex unexplained story presented at the beginning of A New Hope they ultimately do quite a good job at filling in holes and making characters the way that everybody originally saw them. However, I am unable to mark this movie higher because it was too much like the other prequels. The storyline was a bit weak and some of the acting quite poor. I did enjoy watching this movie but there was certainly a lot of room for improvement."
"Jul 13, 2018",4.5,"This movie is awesome and ties in really well with A New Hope! Btw ""It's over Anakin!,I have the higher ground!"""
"Jul 12, 2018",1.5,"It's a meh, for me. AT LEAST IT'S BETTER THAN THE FIRST 2 PREQUELS"
"Jul 09, 2018",5,The best of the prequels
"Jul 08, 2018",5,My second favorite Star Wars movie in the sage. Great action and story. An awesome conclusion to the prequel trilogy.
"Jul 08, 2018",5,Second favorite Star Wars movie. Great action and story. A satisfying conclusion to the prequel trilogy.
"Jul 07, 2018",5,By far my favorite Star Wars movie
"Jul 06, 2018",3.5,"""Return of the Jedi"" is by far the best film in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, but to be fair, the bar wasn't set that high. In a period of war between the Jedi Knights and the Separatists, unknowingly to the Jedi Council and much to their fear, Anakin Skywalker is getting closer and closer to the Dark Side. The Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi has to stop his apprentice from joining the Sith and using his advanced Force skills to work for those with evil purposes. Meanwhile, Anakin is fighting a war with his own self, being unable to understand how to properly protect his wife, Padme. The entire galaxy is turned upside down as the Jedi lose control and the Empire rises, as everything is put in place for the next few decades, which lead to the events of the original trilogy. This film is a massive improvement over both of its predecessors. There are still issues with the dialogue, the melodrama, the straight up uncomfortable romance between Padme and Anakin, Hayden Christensen's horrible acting and a few pacing issues, but everything is reduced compared to the last two films. The tone is more consistent and balanced. This rather interesting storyline of the Star Wars saga comes closer to reaching its full potential. Everything that was good about the previous prequels remains good or improves, further adding to this solid cinematic experience, despite that my personal request for more practical effects by Lucas and co didn't come true in this film either. Overall, it was a surprisingly satisfying ending to a rather frustrating trilogy. Of course, I can't close a Star Wars review without mentioning the epic score by John Williams."
"Jul 04, 2018",5,"Best Star Wars movie of all time. You get to see the struggles Anakin goes through as he turns into the dark lord of the sith, Darth Vader."
"Jul 04, 2018",4.5,Best of the Prequels. If you have a problem with the High Ground then you just don't understand it.
"Jul 03, 2018",3.5,"Quite a good movie, still a lot of frustratingly bad stuff, but much more great stuff, overall this is enjoyable and satisfying, especially after the first two prequels being generally missteps."
"Jul 01, 2018",5,"Nonstop rock solid action in a universe that will never be safe again thanks to fools in the republic both good.. And very evil like sidious. The xbox videogame is just as good.
Dont pay for anything soylo a soy wars story."
"Jun 28, 2018",4.5,perfect in almost everything!
"Jun 26, 2018",3.5,Best of the prequels with good storytelling and a darker tone.  As with the other prequels it's main issues are with dialogue and cgi where practical effects would be more appropriate.
"Jun 26, 2018",4,Wow!! Lucasfilms!!! Very good job!
"Jun 26, 2018",5,"The film was in the spirit of what a star wars film is about,"
"Jun 24, 2018",5,"No doubt my favorite star wars film in the saga. The story, visuals, and music are amazing."
"Jun 24, 2018",3.5,"Overall, the movie was captivating and well worth the see. The fight scenes were spectacular, and combined the perfect amount of emotion and choreography. Additionally, the dialogue has improved, though there could still  be major changes made. However, I have a few complaints. First, I feel that Anakin's turn to the dark side was abrupt, and that the reason for it happening was rather bad, in all honesty. Frankly, it seems that he turned only because he got passed off of a job offer and has nightmares! Secondly, Padmé has suddenly went from a strong female character to doing nothing the whole movie, not even standing up for what she feels is right! And finally, Anakin's possessive and whiny behavior is romanticized, as it brings him good things and Padmé loving him. He never accepts responsibility for his actions, and gets away with everything. All in all, this movie is an amazing conclusion to the prequel trilogy, and I am not trying to persuade you not to see it, though it may seem otherwise. I just would like to share some input. Thank you."
"Jun 24, 2018",5,better than the new ones
"Jun 23, 2018",4.5,"This movie is the culmination of the first 2, the creation of Darth Vader. The action-packed finale to this trilogy is stunning with a 5 star soundtrack and amazing fight sequences!"
"Jun 19, 2018",5,Easily the best of the prequels hands down. This is the way the trilogy should have started instead of how it actually ended when it comes to story and overall tone. I love it. I have seen it numerous times and it has yet to get old.
"Jun 19, 2018",4,Best of the prequels
"Jun 19, 2018",2,"Bang!!! That's how the prequels ended with a majority of the help coming from Obi-Wan and John William's score, and the intrigue that comes with Anakin becoming seduced by the dark side."
"Jun 18, 2018",4.5,George Lucas concludes his polarizing prequel trilogy with stunning visuals and a devastating plot even if certain moments do lack subtlety or logic.
"Jun 18, 2018",5,The best of the prequels in my opinion. This one shines.
"Jun 18, 2018",4,"Very much enjoyed this film. while the prequels have issues here and there, i believe that this film had many postives that made it a great film for the star wars series."
"Jun 17, 2018",5,favorite star wars film ^_^
"Jun 16, 2018",5,Best film of the prequels
"Jun 16, 2018",3,"The best of the prequel trilogy.  Could've been better with a more believable, darker story of how Anakin was turned to the dark side.  This turn should've had an arcing all 3 movies not just the 1."
"Jun 16, 2018",5,"This film fixes almost all of the problems with the first two, better acting, better lines, more emotion and breathtaking action"
"Jun 15, 2018",3,this film had so much potential to be great but it fell short.  still very action packed and entertaining.  I never like the way they developed anakin skywalker through out the prequels.
"Jun 13, 2018",3.5,"The best of the prequels by far. ROTS starts off fun and light (""this is where the fun begins"") and slowly turns dark and depressing as we follow Anakin's descent to the Dark Side, perfectly setting the tone for the mood in A New Hope. Ewan McGregor's charming and charismatic Obi Wan continues to be one of my favorite characters across the Star Wars franchise, and Ian McDiarmid continues to be perfectly creepy and sinister as Palpatine. Hayden Christensen was surprisingly good as angry, evil Anakin. This movie has a little of everything for Star Wars fans, and is a solid conclusion to the rocky trilogy."
"Jun 08, 2018",5,"This chill-inspiring and epic film could not have given a better end to the Star Wars prequel trilogy. With impressive visuals, lots of good action scenes, and a deep and dramatic plot worthy of Shakespeare, Revenge of the Sith is definitely a must see for those who wish to better understand the rise of one of the most famous and beloved villains in the history of cinema."
"Jun 08, 2018",5,BEST STAR WARS MOVIE
"Jun 07, 2018",3.5,"This was a good movie. However, there were a few flaws with the storyline and so on. I think that this movie is still great, though."
"Jun 06, 2018",2.5,I guess the best I can say is that it's the best of the Prequels. I don't hate this movie but it's pretty average to me. Just doesn't hold my attention.
"Jun 05, 2018",3.5,"3.5/5.  Revenge of the Sith is the best of the prequels, with great performances from McGregor and McDiarmid, solid action scenes, and an emotionally heavy story, but the romance plot still sucks, there are a few boring parts, and some really awkward, forced humor."
"Jun 05, 2018",4.5,Star Wars : Episode III-Revenge of the Sith is the best film of the prequel trilogy.The film features a great story and thrilling action scenes
"Jun 03, 2018",5,"The greatest of all of the Star Wars movies perfectly wraps up Anakin's motivations to become evil and has a great amount of action, politics, and sadness."
"Jun 03, 2018",4,This is by far one of the most thrilling and enjoyable movies ever.  Period.
"Jun 02, 2018",3.5,"Decent wrap up to the prequel trilogy, although Anakin’s turn to the dark side is never fully realized, justified, or believable."
"May 31, 2018",5,how the galactic emprie &amp; vader came to be.
"May 31, 2018",3.5,"Easily my favourite of the prequel trilogy. The actors finally feel like they are acting with purpose in this entry, and I really love that the story George Lucas planned for this trilogy comes to ahead in a very satisfying duel. I also really appreciate how the aesthetic of the Old Republic is transformed into the aesthetic of the Empire and the original Star Wars towards the end of the movie. I would have preferred it if the transition was longer, but I'm not going to nit pick. I recently watched this entry again and noticed for the first time that the Jedi Starfighters were actually the precursors to TIE fighters. Very cool.

Overall, I feel like this trilogy is underappreciated. This has to be the darkest of all Star Wars movies, and the contrast is poignant. Seeing the confident Jedi Order reduced to nothing in mere moments by the machinations of Sidious had me holding my breath.

Definitely worth watching."
"May 31, 2018",4,Best of the PT with plenty of action and some great moments. But it also suffers from some storytelling issues.
"May 30, 2018",4.5,One of the best stories of the Star Wars franchise
"May 30, 2018",3.5,despite its obvious flaws i can still enjoy this film.
"May 29, 2018",4.5,i would have given it 5 stars but 'only a sith deals in absolutes'.
"May 28, 2018",4,Best of the prequels
"May 28, 2018",4.5,"Very entertaining, 10/10 for musical score, the darkest of the Star Wars movies."
"May 28, 2018",4.5,Just part of an epic saga despite of it´s flaws
"May 27, 2018",5,better than any Disney crap being put out! Sorry George 
"May 27, 2018",3,Not the best ending ever but this was good for the ending of a trilogy they portrayed vader well but it still dosent compare to the originals or rogue one but still the best of the prequels
"May 27, 2018",4.5,"This movie was hated by most, but I loved it. Anakin VS Obi-Wan is one of the most entertaining parts of the whole star wars franchise. This is my favorite star wars movie. Another good thing this movie did was it got rid of angsty ""I don't like sand."" Anakin and finally gave us the Darth Vader version of him that people were waiting for before this movie."
"May 27, 2018",4,Its not perfect but i still enjoy this movie.
"May 27, 2018",4,still better than the news ones
"May 27, 2018",3,Not at all as bad as episode 1 and 2....a great movie.
"May 26, 2018",3,"Revenge of the Sith is a bit closer to the spirit of Star Wars than the other 2, but its wooden acting and poor execution still keep it in line with the other Star Wars prequels."
"May 26, 2018",4.5,"One of the best of the SW movies. Very well aged CGI, much better writing, very good action scenes, Williams best work of all time, good Christensen, really good McGregor and an oscar worthy performance by Ian McDiarmid. Also much darker than the last two. 4 1/2*"
"May 26, 2018",5,"My 4th all time favorite star wars movie to date, best of the prequels."
"May 26, 2018",5,"Star Wars Revenge of the Sith is now the big moment to know about the Sith the battles keep getting better, Aniken Skywalker is starting to turn bad witch means could he be a Sith! Find out "

A thorough breakdown of the flaws and perfections in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith
-by yours truly

Positives- 

Hayden Christensen's acting skills have greatly improved.
Every lightsaber battle. 
Anakin's gradual succumbing to the Dark side.
It has a vastly improved and far more focused storyline than its two lesser predecessors.
All of the villains.
It has one of the most intense and gripping climaxes in film history.
How  well it sets up and leads into the classic Star Wars trilogy, especially A New Hope.


Negatives-

How easily almost all of the Jedi Masters are assassinated by The Emperor.
The revelation that Darth Vader is really only a half man.
We never get to see Anakin reach his full potential.
The clumsy, corny, and childish dialogue that Hayden Christensen receives.

My grade for the film: an extremely strong B+"
"May 23, 2018",4.5,"This movie is very hard to watch. ""Order 66"" gets me every time! Amazing soundtrack!

The secret to enjoying the prequel trilogy is to treat them altogether as one long film. The trilogy as a whole is far greater than the sum of its parts. There are nuances to the story that you won't see on the first viewing. Senator Palpatine was nothing short a mastermind on a galactic scale."
"May 23, 2018",3,"This is not a bad Star Wars film - I like how it started, but I found the storyline of Revenge of the Sith good but really dark (and rather sad) - then again, it is the story of how Anakin became the one and only Darth Vader.
Plus, what's with Chewbacca joining the other Wookies into battle with the Sith? He was with Solo the whole time way before the events of this film - wonder how on earth he appeared back home? That bit could have been explained properly, I guess.
I liked Anakin and Obi-Wan's lightsaber duel, but I didn't like how it ended. It was too sad, with Anakin screaming, burning up from the lava flames and actually becoming a bad guy full time.
It's an epic Star Wars film, but it could leave you feeling sorry for everything - if you know what I mean."
"May 22, 2018",3.5,"Great lightsaber duels. Best of the prequels. PS, this movie is a classic compared to ""the last Jedi""."
"May 22, 2018",4,I enjoyed this movie. The last of the great movies before Disney.
"May 22, 2018",3.5,Good film. Not great but good.
"May 22, 2018",3,Arguably the best film of the prequel triology isn't without plenty of glaring flaws.
"May 22, 2018",5,"Growing up with the prequels, I can confirm they did their job. Do those Prequel-Haters even wonder why the kids still LOVE Star Wars? George Lucas did a perfect job with Episode 3, making it my favourite movie of all time and making Anakin Skywalker my favourite character."
"May 22, 2018",3.5,The best of the prequels.  While Anakin's motivations don't sell well on screen the final showdowns between Obi-Wan and his apprentice and Yoda and the Emperor are exactly the payoff you want to launch the universe into those 'Dark Times' we first heard about in Old Ben's hovel on Tatooine.
"May 21, 2018",5,Easily the best Star Wars film by a long long shot. Well done I will seriously rewatch this movie forever!
"May 21, 2018",5,The best Star Wars movie
"May 21, 2018",5,"Absolutely and without doubt the best film of the prequel trilogy to Star Wars. Revenge of the Sith captures the fall of Luke's father to becoming Darth Vader and engulfs the movie with a rich war-time darkness. Revenge of the Sith introduces us to amazing villains like General Grievous and finally has Sidious reveal himself to the Jedi, masterminding his political plot against them by using the galaxy and his newly created army to wipe them out. The CGI in the film is possibly at it's finest compared to the previous prequel movies and Anakin's dark side shines through as he fights his former friend Obi-Wan in the climax of how Darth Vader is born."
"May 20, 2018",4,"The beat of the prequel trilogy,dark and moody with lots of betrayal and heartbreak mixed with jawdropping fight scenes."
"May 20, 2018",5,"GREAT movie that I think is underrated.  I can see why though.  Like the other prequels, this has some cringeworthy script issues.  But the plotline itself is arguably the best in the franchise.  So much happens in this movie, and for the most part, they pace it very well.  This movie does a good job of bringing the franchise full circle.  Definitely one of the best in the franchise.  The fights are mostly top notch.  Couple of choreography issues there but the good FAR outweighs the bad."
"May 20, 2018",5,"this film is probably one of the best Starwars movies i have seen (and ive seen them all multiple times) the opening scene is great it actually makes it feel like a wars going on (you know star WARS) unlike some of the other films (Star BATTLES)

Generally though while it does have some weak dialog at times, the fight scenes are just the best, even the new films made by Disney do not hold up to par on these, George Lucas wanted to the the jedi in their prime and i think he done an amazing job showing that.

i think personally though that he should of included some of the clone wars sotryline into this film like the clones having chips in their heads to follow orders without question, The Death Star Kyber Crystal etc etc but you can only fit so much in a film i guess

all in all 10/10 must watch"
"May 19, 2018",3.5,"definitely could have been done better, but atleast with this movie I finally understand why they went with the actor for Anakin, and where they were going with it, even though they could have done much better to get there. I feel this is the best of the first three movies."
"May 19, 2018",5,Great non Disney film
"May 18, 2018",4,"The best of the prequals, I felt they were good stories but sure some things could have been better, over all it covers the back story of Anaking and the Jedi Order these are much better than Ep 7-8"
"May 18, 2018",5,an amazing star wars film with amazing action
"May 17, 2018",5,Best of the Preqel Trilogy
"May 17, 2018",4.5,The thrilling conclusion to the prequel trilogy doesn't disappoint. This has some of the greatest lightsaber battles in all of Star Wars. The 5 min Plagueis scene in RotS has more lore and storytelling then the entire Disney trilogy combined. Anakin is the only chosen one.
"May 17, 2018",5,"This is actually a really fucking good movie. Maybe even better than Return of The Jedi.
You know what? I'd take the prequels any day over the Sequel Trilogy."
"May 16, 2018",4,"A beautiful movie,with a beautiful score. The Obi-Wan- Anakin duel is eye watering moment.Ian Mcdiarmid is amazing.Also you truly see the origin of Vader in Hayden Christensen."
"May 10, 2018",4.5,"Even though there are a few lines of dialogue that are not the most convincing, Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christenen carry this story with realistic emotion and captivate the audience. A lot of drama, great action scenes, and an epic Finale that is tear-jerking creates a standing argument for why this is the most favored movie of the Prequels."
"May 09, 2018",3,How Anakin was turned into the dark side was a bit too pushed. Overall effects were cool and all but plot was a bit lacking and lazy
"May 07, 2018",4,Good movie. Great lightsaber battle
"May 06, 2018",5,Amazing movie. Best Star Wars movie ever
"May 06, 2018",5,Best Star Wars Movie
"May 05, 2018",5,"Favorite quotes:
DO IT
I AM THE SENATE
THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS
ANOTHER HAPPY LANDING
IRONIC
UNLIMITEEEEEED POWER"
"May 05, 2018",3.5,This is number 4 on my top Star Wars movies list and for a very good reason. The musical score was just outstanding and the chemistry that the characters shared was so believable. The only thing I would ever take off points for was that R2-D2 seems like an extra or a VERY MINOR character.
"May 03, 2018",4,"There was no reason for me to think ""Revenge of the Sith"" would be good after the last two. Boy, was I wrong!"
"May 02, 2018",2,Episode 3? More like Revenge of the Green Screen.
"Apr 29, 2018",5,"Love all Originals and Prequels, wish I could say the same for the Sequels"
"Apr 28, 2018",4,"Great wrap and send off to the series, everything tied up very well with minimal plot holes present. The story is propelled by emotion and tragedy with the knowledge of what will happen on behalf of the audience. The dialogue is shaky in parts but the acting and pacing a lot better than the other two prequels, and the tones, themes and concepts, with cinematic techniques are all spot on"
"Apr 27, 2018",3.5,"This installment actually gave satisfied me. It had great action, an amazing story line, badass characters, and the best opening scene I think in the star wars universe. Although this film does suffer from bad acting, terrible writing in some places, but i'm glad to see George Lucas had dropped his attempt to bring humor into the film in the third installment. Star wars Revenge of the Sith was by far superior to the other two prequel movies, its a big improvement from Attack of the clones, but still has its troubles, overall, not bad, but still not great."
"Apr 27, 2018",5,A good closing to the prequels trilogy.
"Apr 26, 2018",4,"This movie is extremely underrated, the action is great, the emotion is gripping, the CGI is incredible even by todays standards and the sound and music is amazing. Its only issue is the dialog ( at times ), mostly through Anakins and Padmes conversations, aswell as the classic NOOOOOOOO!!!  ect. but it doesnt break the movie since i actually believe the acting by all the actors is great, mostly in the final act, but it can seem flawed just due to the dialog."
"Apr 25, 2018",2.5,No Jar Jar. Still bad acting and lines. Awesome lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and Vader
"Apr 25, 2018",3.5,"Great opening and ending only failed by Anakin's acting and that ""nooooo"" bit...."
"Apr 23, 2018",4,best prequel by far. fun action. good story but the acting is all over the places some times its great and some times its just bad but over all its a good movie
"Apr 23, 2018",4.5,Needed a bit of editing but it was a great film.
"Apr 22, 2018",5,"Excellent storytelling, excellent visual effects and atmosphere throughout the movie. Great way to end the prequel saga which was for lack of a better word, rough. This movie gave fans everything they wanted to see out of the prequels and more, with more amazingly choreographed saber duels and Anakin Skywalker's full transition into Darth Vader."
"Apr 20, 2018",4.5,"Fantastic Star Wars. Everyone embraces their roles, the story plays out, the movie is longer but action packed the entire time. There is not much to say, other than it is a must watch. Rating: 4.5/5 88%"
"Apr 16, 2018",5,One of the best and most intense movies of the Star Wars saga!
"Apr 15, 2018",4.5,"Good, entertaining, and dark, this has some of the most action packed, and enjoyable scenes in the franchise."
"Apr 14, 2018",3.5,This movie was the best prequel movie of the saga.
"Apr 12, 2018",5,"The best. Music, script, fights this is star wars"
"Apr 07, 2018",1.5,"Just as dull and poorly acted as Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones. Whilst this is the least boring, it also contains terrible dialogue and clueless direction."
"Apr 05, 2018",4,after some personal recutting its easily the best star wars movie.
"Apr 04, 2018",4.5,"Well George had no choice but to adhere to the fans by this point, and boy did he shove a good spoonful into their crying mouths. Like the movie or not, you cannot deny the epic scale of it. The movie is dark, violent, and is exactly what the prequels needed."
"Apr 04, 2018",5,Best Star Wars movie for me ever
"Apr 04, 2018",3,"Definitely the best film in the prequel trilogy, however it still does suffer from many of the problems that the other two do. This one did overall have a more interesting story with a darker tone and some good parts."
"Apr 03, 2018",3.5,"With an opening sequence that captures all what makes star wars great, the last of the prequels starts with the right foot, and proceeds to deliver a very interesting story about the collapse of a republic and the fall of a hero. Unfortunately, clunky dialogue and really poor use of ""walk-and-talk"" scenes prevent this one from being great. the movie sometimes slows down to a crawl, and the final duel may be a bit too much over the top, but this is in my opinion for sure a good film."
"Apr 02, 2018",3,Better..delivered with darker tones of storytelling with an edge of malice. Epic battles.
"Mar 31, 2018",4,Best prequel by far but still some problems 
"Mar 30, 2018",3,"This is an O.K. movie. Lucas recovered with Episode III, but only to the level of The Phantom Menace."
"Mar 30, 2018",5,I like more that ep8
"Mar 30, 2018",5,IMO the best star wars movie to date.
"Mar 29, 2018",5,Its the greatest movie of all time
"Mar 27, 2018",5,"Nice christensen is so ripped eve
More now"
"Mar 26, 2018",3.5,The best of the prequel trilogy in the Star Wars saga.
"Mar 25, 2018",4.5,"Cheesy writting and poor pacing aside, this is my favorite Star Wars movie, only rivaled by the original one. If only the prequels were this good from the beggining, maybe we wouldn't end up in the dark place we are now..."
"Mar 24, 2018",5,10/10 Not only is it the best out of the three prequels but imo it's the best star wars movie in the trilogy!!! I love all the prequels but Revenge Of The Sith is just amazing!
"Mar 21, 2018",5,Lots of Jedi die. Darth Vader is born.
"Mar 20, 2018",3.5,"the better of the Star Wars prequels. relatively good writing. much more self conscious about direction and tone due to the hammering critics and viewed gave Ep 1 and 2 high emotion by the end. anakins struggle with Light and Dark and palpable, the fall of the Jedi and democracy crushing. the tie in to A New Hope was also well done a salvage job but a good one"
"Mar 20, 2018",4,"The Revenge of the Sith succeeds on the action and emotional front, but fails to conclude the Prequel Trilogy in a dazzling way."
"Mar 19, 2018",3,"Elderly man seduces young boy into committing genocide and killing his wife, ends up becoming robotic paraplegic"
"Mar 19, 2018",3.5,"Finally, a Star Wars film that lives up to the name. Revenge of the Sith brings a good story, solid acting and impressive visuals. This film is still not as good as any of the originals, but it does end this rather forgettable trilogy on a good note."
"Mar 19, 2018",5,"Connects all the dots in prequels to the originals, very well made and well explained by mr Lucas . The best Star Wars film I’ve seen"
"Mar 18, 2018",5,"This is my favorite Star Wars movie, while objectively it is not the best, I thoroughly enjoy every part of this movie. Ewan McGregor's acting is superb, the turn of Anakin is completed in a compelling and slightly surprising way, and the choreography was fantastic. The visual effects are incredible too, General Grievous' animation is still flawless even after nearly 15 years and upgraded to 4K. The score by the masterful John Williams is inspiring and beautiful. Finally, the space battles provide some of the most incredible action set pieces in cinema to date."
"Mar 18, 2018",4.5,"The character of general grievous is very interesting, Ian MacDiarmid playing Palpatine/darth Sidious does a brilliant acting, the war sequences has so many elements and happen so fast that makes difficult to see all as I would wanted, the essence of the atmosphere in the movie is absolutely dramatic and is a lot prominent in the end with the actings of Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen playing Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, also the death of Padme and his funeral are very heartbreaking"
"Mar 17, 2018",3,"Hayden Christensen's Anakin is still wooden, but it is a great story.  The Lucas universe is brilliant and I can't get enough of it."
"Mar 15, 2018",5,"To lay down some backstory, when the first two Star Wars prequels came out there was a lot of backlash from original Star Wars fans because of the poor and cheesy writing, overuse of Computer Generated Images (CGI), Jar Jar Binks's annoying appearance, and generally not knowing where the plot was going or who the main character was. Some thought George Lucas had damaged the series beyond repair. Then Star Wars Ep. 3 Revenge of the Sith came out in 2005 and many who criticized the previous two films came back in troves to watch this one. It had appeared George Lucas had listened to the fans and put together a spectacular story that united the two trilogies together. One that corrected most of the two previous films mistakes and improving upon the ones he didn't fully correct. One that ended up tying the two trilogies together, finishing the old story of father and son and adding a new perspective to to the Empire which was previously a Republic. And adding more action and fighting than the previous films. It was so good, and I will go further into depth as to why it is, with explaining the characters, story and plot devices.
First we will talk about main characters and their roles in this story. To start off we have the main character Anakin Skywalker (portrayed by Hayden Christiansen) who is conflicted between light and dark side because of events leading up to his eventual turn to Darth Vader. Second is Obi-Wan Kenobi (portrayed by Ewan McGregor) who is Anakin's Mentor/ Master and member of the confused and deceived Jedi council. Next is Padme Amidala (portrayed by Natalie Portman) who is Anakin's lover, and one of the Galactic Republic's senators from the planetary system of Naboo. Then last but not least there Sheev Palpatine (portrayed by Ian McDiarmid) Who is the Chancellor of the Galactic Republic who is also secretly the two faced Sith lord Darth Sidious who is trying to overthrow the Republic and kill all the Jedi.
    The movie starts out with a raid going on over Coruscant (A city planet with over 2,000 levels to it) were the two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker launch a daring attempt to rescue the Chancellor from the Separatist droid commander General Grievous with action scenes in space, and with some nice fighting action in Grievous's flagship. There's some nice comedic relief moments with R2-D2 and some droids. They find the Chancellor with Count Dooku and an epic lightsaber fight, they kill Dooku and Grievous escapes. Then the ship starts to fall apart because of the massive fight that took place above the planet. Then Anakin is rushed to land the destroyed ship carefully on a runway, he does and they have  ""Another happy landing"". Successfully securing the Chancellor Obi-Wan goes to report to the Jedi council and Anakin goes to see Padme. She drops the bomb that she is pregnant and Anakin is stunned, more drama goes down, he gets accepted on the council but gets refused the rank of master and is furious at that. He has a premonition of Padme dying at childbirth and he gets worried, Palpatine tells him later at a bubble opera about Darth Plagueis and that he was figuring out a way to cheat death and save people from dying. Anakin becomes intrigued to the power of the dark side because of this. Obi-Wan is sent to Utapao because of clone intelligences spotting of General Grievous's person, Anakin wanted to go and was selected by the Chancellor but was chosen to stay at the temple while Yoda is sent Kashyyyk because of his good relations with the wookies and the droid attack on the wookies. 

        While most of the Jedi are away Palpatine plants the seeds of doubt into Anakin's head comparing the Jedi to the Sith. And how they're similar in almost every way. Things happen, Palpatine gets figured out by Mace Windu and he tries to arrest the Chancellor, but 3 Jedi are killed and Anakin shows up right before Mace is about to kill him. Anakin kills Windu and out of shame he pledges to his teachings in order to save Padme. Then he executes order 66, and the clones are forced to kill the Jedi. Tons of Jedi are killed and the Jedi Temple is set ablaze. Anakin is then sent to Mustafar to kill the separatist leaders. Padme shows up and talks with him and about what he's become. Obi Wan was secretly on the shuttle Padme was in and she is knocked out by Anakin. Obi Wan and Anakin start duking it out and at the end of it Anakin loses to Obi Wan because of the high ground, Anakin then becomes Darth Vader and Padme dies at childbirth.

     So why we should care about this is because that this is a story of a boy who was ripped away from his mother because of prophesy of an old order who has become so ignorant and blind that they can't see the danger that's right in front of their faces. A story of his love and how he was a slave. A story of how a brother and a friend betrayed him and became his master (Palpatine).

    So why do we care about about the characters? Why do we care about the story? And most importantly, why do we care about the why of things? Well the characters are the people in the story, they make the story and can be memorable in good ways and bad. In that way we get attached to them. This is why we must focus of the why of things. Because the why is the story. Why does Anakin turn to the dark side? Why does his mother die? Why does the Jedi Council not trust Anakin? All these questions form a good solid story with excellent characters and decent action scenes. I stand where I stand and the film is good.

"Mar 14, 2018",4,I personally liked it.  I personally thought the story of Anikan's transition to the dark side was ok.
"Mar 14, 2018",4.5,"Revenge of the Sith is by far the most underappreciated film in the Star Wars saga. Definitely not the most critically polarizing, but surely has many fans and critics divided. The prequel trilogy from the late 90s to mid 00s are usually skippable for most, but this one is actually good, seriously. It perfectly shaped the future of the universe, which flowed perfectly into the original trilogy. Christensen was a very good Vader, and embodied the darkness of the legendary Sith lord. McGregor played a broken, but powerful Kenobi. He lost nearly all of his fellow Jedi, and his Padawan turned into the downfall of the galaxy. Although there are some issues, specifically the weak, uninspired deaths of the minor Jedi, and the overly emotional Padme performance by Portman. The action is fantastic though, with the space scenes captivating me from first watch. The Palpatine and Yoda duel was interesting, but not as much as Vader vs Kenobi. Likely the best fight sequence in the history of Star Wars, the battle of true good and evil, there is so much weight in the encounter. Episode 3 really nailed a more dark tone to carry over into the demise of the Republic and rise of the Empire. 9/10"
"Mar 13, 2018",4,Best fight scene of all star wars films. Characters have personality. A little confusing if you haven't seen the previous film.
"Mar 12, 2018",3,"Best of the prequel trilogy, with hints of a good story"
"Mar 09, 2018",4,anakin will always be my man crush.
"Mar 05, 2018",5,"Anakin v. Obi Wan, nuff said"
"Mar 01, 2018",5,"I remember seeing this as a kid and actually not liking it as much as 1 or 2 strangely enough, but looking back this definitely one of the best star wars films ever made. I would only consider 4 or 5 above this one.

Gone is the stale dialoge and boring characters of the first 2 films. The characters are full of personality and their thoughts and motives become increasingly palpable as the movie goes on. The treachery of the emperor, the suspicions of the jedi and the turmoil within Anakin make for an excellent, suspenseful story.

The deep story is complemented by the engaging action scenes and cool villains. The emperor is ruthless, Anakin becomes deranged and who could forget General Grevious? Admittedly he wasn't super developed, but he looked pretty damn cool in the action scenes.

The only real flaw that burdens the whole movie is that while watching them in the order they came out you already know how the movie is going to end. The movie really draws you in though and leaves you constantly wondering how though it will happen. Also the child killing scene was unnecessary. Seemed a little too cruel for just becoming evil."
"Feb 27, 2018",5,the only reason why i'm giving it 5 stars is because of ewan mcgregor
"Feb 26, 2018",3.5,"Star Wars episode 3 is probably the best out of the prequels. It definitely has the most action out of the prequels, and the most interesting plot, especially with the revelation of the emperor. However, it is very intense for a Star Wars movie given that it is PG-13 with more explicit gore than usual which definitely was a negative, and more intense scenes like the pregnancy scene, the Jedi dying, the emperor revealed, anakin getting burned, general grevious, and the count dooku fight. So although it is technically the best Star Wars prequel film, I definitely don’t enjoy watching parts of it. "
"Feb 25, 2018",4,Work of genius compared to the stuff Disney are now putting out!
"Feb 25, 2018",4,Best of the prequels.
"Feb 24, 2018",3.5,"There is no denying that the stiff acting and awkwardness of the other 2 prequel films is here, but this one comes just short of a fitting Star Wars prequel movie. We get the best out of the prequels in this film, including some surprisingly convincing acting from Hayden Christensen. Many moments shine, but many moments are also decently cringe-worthy. This movie may not forgive the sins of the other two, but it is serviceable at the worst and somewhat above average at best."
"Feb 24, 2018",4,"Well, people thought Star Wars films couldn't get any worse with George Lucas writing and directing the prequels. They were wrong. Disney and Lucasfilm under Kathleen Kennedy went above and beyond on that one. Revenge of the Sith is a fantastic wrap-up to the prequel trilogy and a great send off for Anakin Skywalker. Aside from the cliché dialogue in some scenes, Episode III was definitely the best prequel. This film has two of the best acted scenes in the saga where both Anakin and Padmé stare out the window on Coruscant with the Ruminations song playing in the background. There's no dialogue because they're so far apart from one another, but you can feel Anakin's pain as his tears go down his face. He feels he has to betray the Jedi in order for Palpatine to help him save Padmé. The other great scene is the conversation between Anakin and Palpatine at the opera house. Palpatine tells Anakin the tragic story of Darth Plagueis, the Wise. In my opinion, it was the best acted scene in this trilogy with meaningful dialogue. The arrest scene between Palpatine, Mace Windu, Kit Fisto, and another Jedi could have been better. Palpatine lunged at the four Jedi and yet, not one of them attacked him quick enough and he ended up one of them. 

Kit Fisto's death happened way too sudden. I knew it was going to come down to Mace Windu and Palpatine, but the Jedi deaths could have been a little more believable in this scene. The scene where the clone troopers betray and hunt down all of the Jedi on the different planets was another fantastic scene in the saga. The duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan was entertaining all throughout, but I thought it dragged on a bit too long. The other duel between Yoda and Darth Sidious was perfect. This film demonstrated Chancellor Palpatine's true strength and power with the dark side even without his lightsaber. At the end of the film, Anakin Skywalker ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader like what Obi-Wan said in Return of the Jedi. Padmé gave birth to Luke and Leia Skywalker as well. It shows the early stages of the first Galactic Empire at the end of the film and the construction of the Death Star as Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader stare out into space. I wish George Lucas could have showed more of Anakin's and Obi-Wan's friendship in this trilogy."
"Feb 23, 2018",2,Rushed and horrible acting. Made me hate star wars.
"Feb 23, 2018",3,Entertaining movie the weakest in my opinion of the 3 new trilogy but I enjoyed parts of it especially the fight scenes.
"Feb 21, 2018",4,Easily the best of the prequels. Powerful story and mythology. Great lightsaber duels and music. Terrible script.
"Feb 17, 2018",5,i loved this movie the action was awesome and this episode had no jar jar which was awesome and it had a darker tone and wasn't all about politics like the last 2
"Feb 17, 2018",3.5,"While not being as good as the original trilogy...Revenge Of The Sith somehow justify's the prequels in my opinion, and at least adds a worthwhile installment to the Prequel trilogy. With a very satisfying final fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin. But it still never manages to be as good as Episodes IV - VI
 I'll give it 
         - 68%"
"Feb 17, 2018",5,George Lucas nailed it with this movie. I felt every emotion in existence while watching this movie. 
"Feb 15, 2018",5,"Revenge of the Sith is an epic tragedy a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
Anakin Skywalker, who saw nightmares of his mother in pain before she died in his arms, sees nightmares of his wife Padme dying in childbirth and makes a deal with the devil, which destroys the galaxy. 

Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars episode since Empire Strikes Back, if not the best in the saga. Ian Mcdiarmid's portrayal of Palpatine sends shivers down my spine. The battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan on Mustafar is the best choreographed and most emotionally compelling swordfight in cinematic history. The special effects are timeless. John Williams' score is unsurpassed."
"Feb 12, 2018",3,The plot loses me when they turn the whinny Skywalker into Vader.
"Feb 12, 2018",4.5,"An emotional and action-packed finale to the prequel trilogy, 'Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith' delivers on every level. Emotion and storytelling drive the film forward and it works out brilliantly. The most intriguing film in the prequel trilogy by far, I rank this film 90%."
"Feb 11, 2018",5,"The republic in all it's grandeur.......great performances from ian mcdiarmid, ewan mcgregor.......A very underated film especially when compared to force awakens and the last jedi.....It's from a time when star wars characters actions were logical and actually made sense..."
"Feb 10, 2018",5,13ish years later and I still believe that this is the best of the Star Wars prequels.
"Feb 09, 2018",5,Even the die hard prequel haters generally admit this was a good one. This has everything you could want in a Star Wars movie.
"Feb 09, 2018",4.5,Easily the best of the prequels. Even better after seeing the ridiculous waste of time that is The Last Jedi. At least this has character development and a story arc not to mention fantastic space battles and lightsaber action.
"Feb 08, 2018",5,Not only is it the best in the Prequel trilogy it is also the best in the franchise...
"Feb 07, 2018",3.5,"Existing issues such as clunky dialogue and inconsistent acting persist, but the positives outweigh the negatives. Emperor Palpatine is sublime in this film, and his presence smooths out the edges of Anakin's descent into darkness. The final fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin is iconic, and, in my opinion, its one of the best sequences in the whole franchise."
"Feb 06, 2018",4.5,One of my favorite movies Star Wars The Revenge of the Sith is one of the best Star Wars movie and the best prequel Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Won Kenobi is beautiful . You could watch it as much as you want you will never get bored of this movie overall it was one of the best Star Wars movies.
"Feb 06, 2018",4,"Not the best movie ever, but definitely the best Star Wars prequel."
"Feb 06, 2018",5,"the best star wars movie in the whole saga, best opening scene, best light saber dual, the rage in Ankin was really good, made me cry little."

"Feb 04, 2018",4,"Definitely the best of the Anakin Trilogy.  Fun, exciting, tragic, and powerful at times.  Still not without some flaws.  A nice close to this trilogy."
"Feb 03, 2018",5,When A film is able to show you things multiple times after  multiple viewings you know you have a keeper. Up there with Empire. Fantastic movie that really closes Ep1-6
"Feb 03, 2018",5,"My favorite in the series, right behind Return of the Jedi. Great, emotional story, cool characters return, wonderful visual (as usual), improved dialogue, the best lightsaber duels, I could go on and on about it, but this movie was/is great. "
"Feb 02, 2018",3.5,"Here it is. The watchable Star Wars Prequel. The one that nails lightsaber fight choreography, dials down on the cringe worthy dialogue, and most importantly, Jar Jar Binks doesn't say a single line in the whole movie (how good is that). However the movie suffers from some cringe worthy dialogue (A lot less than ""Attack of the Clones"" at least"") and some slow moments that takes the pacing of the movie off. A satisfying end to the prequel trilogy and hopefully no Star Wars movie will ever be as bad as ""Attack of the Clones""."
"Feb 01, 2018",5,This is the best movie ive ever seen in my opinion
"Feb 01, 2018",5,"Its Star Wars So I'm Giving It Five Stars!! Actually A Great Film! Dark, But Fun!! I Know People Don't Really Like The Prequels But This Ones REALLY Good!!"
"Jan 30, 2018",4,"Some lost opportunities but, overall a satisfying conclusion to the prequels."
"Jan 29, 2018",5,What a powerful film. The last Star Wars of its kind.
"Jan 29, 2018",1,"Worst Star Wars movie ever.  I was actually glad to see the character of Anakin dismembered.  And not for the reasons the movie intended.  Possibly the most miscast ""pretty boy"" Darth Vader of all time.  Guy was terrible."
"Jan 25, 2018",5,My favourite Star Wars film.
"Jan 25, 2018",5,"In retrospect, this film is so SUPERIOR to Last Jedi/Rogue One and all the appalling Disney trash in every way. 
Come back George, all is forgiven!"
"Jan 25, 2018",5,Star Wars revenge of the Sith now leads to how Aniken skywalker becomes Vader The epic battle was Obi-Wan Kenobi versus Anakin Skywalker that was a hard battle! So much action if people wanna know who Darth Vader is and how he became him you know want to do play the movie and you will get your answers. This has been the best Star Wars so far!!
"Jan 23, 2018",4.5,"Épica símplemente una película a la altura de las originales, los combates simplemente fueron 2 de los 3 combates de toda la saga, la película mas oscura de Star Wars toda una tragedia griega"
"Jan 23, 2018",5,Best movie of the Star Wars saga.
"Jan 20, 2018",3.5,"Far better than the first two in this trilogy, some great action sequences and it feels more sensible."
"Jan 19, 2018",2.5,"Darth Sidious reveals himself and implies his master knew the Sith secrets of molecular manipulation in organic matter; meanwhile a bizarrely organic art show plays as the central focus of the background.  An action-heavy space combat scene with peak Jedi skills, the death of Darth Tyrannus, and an escape from a broken starship falling into orbit.  It all kind of decelerates after the opening, but only out of hyperspace.  The talking scenes between the action play passionlessly.  The war continues until the Jedi finally detect the Dark Side around Palpatine, and...  They.  All.  Die.  More battle droids, more clones, a newly raised Lord Vader, a duel between two Jedi Masters, wookies at war, General Grievous with his persistent cough,  and Obi Wan failing Anakin (which he admittts).  ... and Mustafar.  ... and James Earl Jones. ... and Palpatine is always so jovial about everything, he's just great."
"Jan 18, 2018",4.5,"Revenge of the Sith brings the prequel series to a fantastic conclusion with giving the best performance out of all the ones in the prequel series. This ones gives use a great back story into how Darth Vader came to be himself. It is a sad but spectacular movie over all. The visual effects and animatronics continue to be gorgeous especially R2-D2. Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, and Anthony Daniels each give great performances. Frank Oz's voice over performance is great. The makeup and costumes were very nice. Also the musical score was fantastic."
"Jan 18, 2018",5,I consider this a masterpiece next to the steaming pile of garbage that is The Last Jedi. I will be boycotting episode IX; Johnson ruined Star Wars. 
"Jan 17, 2018",5,"Never have I ever (and Possibly never will again) gone into the Cinema feeling so excited and having such high expectations and come out feeling those expectations blown away, it was awesome... I was 15.

Overall Story:
The final plunge into darkness for our Hero, sure still a little bit of clunky dialogue, this is a great film and my favourite of the prequels, bad S*** happens and it builds into the film where it all kicked off. plus has the greatest lightsaber fight scene of all time.

Edits:
1. Anakin should have got the suit on earlier and killed some more jedi
2. Padme, should already have had the twins but was kept them secret even from Anakin as she could feel something different, and thinks that they're on the wrong side.
3. Anakin kills Padme with the vader suit on, feeling betrayed, thinking Obi wan is going behind his back.
4. No Yoda v Emperor. bigger Mace v Emperor. (reasons in review of episode 2)
5. Anakin kills Maul at the start instead of Dooku.
6. Obi Wan should of talked to Dead Qui Got
7. Episode 2-3 focus should of changed from Obi ones perspective to Anakin.
8.Jar Jar (dark jedi) killed off, Grevious' body guard."
"Jan 16, 2018",4.5,"I do see the flaws, but movie is really exciting, and something I have rewatched multiple times, and sometimes still just watch some scenes on Youtube. Hayden Christensen, I think in this one gave good performance, after being slightly annoying in AOTC"
"Jan 16, 2018",3,The best movie of the trilogy. Great action and better character development.
"Jan 15, 2018",5,Personally this is my favorite Star Wars movie. It has the best light saber action. The main characters are very well displayed and seeing Yoda being a bada$$ really made it for me. After seeing The Last Jedi which is the world's worst movie. I wanted to come here and review this wonderful film.
"Jan 15, 2018",3.5,"It still has a poor script and some plots holes  and character development that make absolutely no sense but Star wars Episode 3 is without a doubt the best of the prequels and one of my favorite star wars movies. It's filled with great action, cool characters and plot that is quick to grasp and understand. some scenes in this film are some of the best out of all the star Wars films. There's so much cool stuff in this film that it honestly makes you forget about all the bad stuff. Star Wars Episode 3 is a very enjoyable film if you can overlook the flaws"
"Jan 15, 2018",3.5,"An epic culmination of the derided prequels. There is a lot of emotional depth here, but the film is stricken with the ailments typical of its prequel siblings."
"Jan 15, 2018",5,"Outstanding film. Nearly brought to tears on each rewatch. The tragedy is very profound and operatic. John Williams score, along with Ben Burtt sound design and Lucas' deft shot choices/editing decisions/writing tell the story masterfully along with some of the best cinematography in the franchise. Red letter media are just straight up bitter and contrarian. People who hate the prequels know alot less about what makes a film good than they think they do."
"Jan 15, 2018",4,This movie deserves a lot more credit than it gets. It's int the top half of star wars movies for me and still has the best lightsaber fights which make it enjoyable despite obvious errors.
"Jan 14, 2018",3,"After witnessing the most appalling Star Wars movie, The Last Jedi, I decided to revisit Lucas' prequels. Now, I grew up in the '80s, loving the origins, however, I wasn't impressed with the prequels-mainly, because of the overuse and abuse of the CGI technique. After seeing Rian Johnson butcher Star Wars, I'm now more appreciative of what Lucas was trying to achieve. ROTS is by far the best of the prequels; the bad parts are firstly, the wooden relationship between Padme and Anakin, along with some of the poor dialogue. Also, Anakin's turning to the dark side is poorly executed-and, there are other little issues, although, for the most part, the story is generally good, and it remains true to the spirit of the Star Wars universe. The other main issue is the misuse of CGI, which should be used to enhance, and not be constantly used as substance; like on the other two prequels, it doesn't feel organic, unlike the originals, which looked and felt real. If ROTS looked like The Force Awaken/Rogue One, then it would be a better movie, overall. Still-after the disgraceful, The Last Jedi, I'm sure more detractors of the prequels might look at them, and Lucas, more favourably now; I certainly do."
"Jan 14, 2018",3.5,"Not perfect, but had a lot of good, powerful moments between characters."
"Jan 13, 2018",4.5,"This movie represents the prequel universe in an astounding way and is in my opinion the best of the prequels by far. From the start, the viewer is hit with extremely fun action-packed sequences with an actually decent to good performance from Hayden Christensen. The CGI in this movie is also noticeably better than in the previous two movies. I don't know what to say about this movie other than it is a blast to watch, but I will list my positives first and what negatives I have last. First, Palpatine is absolutely fantastic in this movie. Ian McDiarmid offers the best performance in this movie and is the absolute epitome of evil in the Star Wars universe. Ewan McGregor, once again, is fantastic in this movie, even rivaling Sir Alec Guinness himself. The overall action in this movie never fails to keep me entertained, and, occasionally, on the edge of my seat even though I've seen this movie countless times. The way George Lucas presents the fall of the Jedi and Palpatine's evil, convoluted plan is just brilliant and offers the saddest scene in any Star Wars related material to date. Haydne Christensen does a better job in this movie, yet it still isn't amazing. However, he is an amazing duelist (along with Ewan McGregor). Anakin and Obi-Wan's duel was simply epic. The emotion and the choreography was present everywhere and it is by far my favorite duel of the prequels. If I listed any more positives about this movie, I'd be covering most of the scenes in this movie. One last positive is that this movie is extremely dark and eerie. No other Star Wars movie has this feeling and that's what causes this to stand out. Oh, and John Williams score is godamn phenomenal (see, I can't stop listing positives).

Now for the negatives, or at least thing that weren't amazing. Some of the dialogue felt cringy, such as in the previous movie, and some of the line delivery (Hayden Christensen) felt forced and strange. I also felt that Dooku was underutilized in this, but that is more of a personal nitpick because I frankly love Dooku but he wasn't supposed to be the main focus in this movie so I understand. Finally, Padme's death was kind of... weird. ""She no longer has the will to live,"" yeah, okay...

Overall, this movie presents a heartbreaking finale to the bumpy ride that was the prequels and is an extremely enjoyable movie."
"Jan 13, 2018",4.5,"Undoubtedly the best of the prequel trilogy and one of the best in the saga.  I loved everything about this movie except for a few very specific moments, including the (thankfully) small amount romance scenes and a few times when Hayden Christensen's acting faltered.  Also, Padme just died of sadness... sure.  Other than that, everything in this movie was great.  John Williams' score continues to amaze even the tone-deaf, and visuals have improved from the last two movies.  Acting is also at its best of the trilogy - Ian McDiarmid, Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, and Samuel L. Jackson are all outstandingly convincing at playing their roles.  Even Christensen's acting has improved since AOTC.  The story is masterfully crafted:  A conflicted Anakin, terrified of losing his wife, falls under the influence of Chancellor Palpatine, who eventually reveals himself as a Sith Lord and promises to help him save Padme as long as Anakin joins him.  Palpatine's manipulation of the galaxy is now complete, and in one fell swoop his master plan comes into fruition - he employs the fallen Anakin as his new Sith apprentice, ends the Clone Wars, annihilates the Jedi, and instates himself as Galactic Emperor.  Obi-Wan confronts his fallen apprentice, and in one of the most epic duels of the saga he defeats and maims Anakin, leaving him for dead.  Anakin is furious at his defeat, and his anger is multiplied ten-fold at the eventual loss of his wife, and he fully succumbs to the dark side and effectively becomes Palpatine's slave.  He is completely unaware of his children's birth, however, which leads everything nicely into the original trilogy.  Not only is the plot amazing, but it is deftly scattered in between exhilarating action and touching moments of emotion.  An astounding movie and a satisfying end to the prequel trilogy, I could watch it 100 times and still never get bored."
"Jan 12, 2018",3,Not as good as the original trilogy but i enjoyed it
"Jan 12, 2018",3,Only movie of the three prequels by George Lucas that I enjoyed. I especially liked the action sequences between Yoda and Palpatine. The only drawback in the movie was the first hour leading up to it. Dull but tolerable.
"Jan 12, 2018",5,",My all-time favorite Star Wars movie, Revenge of the Sith is a fun, exciting and tragic film. Nothing Disney does can ever compare."
"Jan 11, 2018",3.5,its the best prequl if i even spelled that right because i make mistakes in typing
"Jan 11, 2018",5,"This movie was awesome, it actually felt like a Star wars film, it had memorable moments and is MUCH better than the Social justice warrior crap Rian Johnson and KKkAthleen Kennedy spewed."
"Jan 10, 2018",3,Hayden Christensen is fun to laugh at. That's really where any enjoyment of this film comes from.
"Jan 10, 2018",5,"The duel with maul made ep1 for me but ep3 is def the strongest , shows in great depth Anakin s progression to the dark side , awesome duel with obi wan too ."
"Jan 09, 2018",5,"Better than the Disney crap, except Rogue One which I really liked. Way better than the last Jedi."
"Jan 09, 2018",5,The best of the prequels.
"Jan 09, 2018",3,Best of the prequels
"Jan 09, 2018",1,"Meh... Not as smart as I'd like it to be .... A poorly-cast protagonist, much younger than he should be ... Weak argument and tiring acrobatic fights with lightsaber that do not get even close to the elegance, seriousness and seigniory of the first trilogy..."
"Jan 09, 2018",5,"This is my favorite STAR WARS MOVIE EVER! 
Very underrated I watch it weekly.
All the actors are amazing in his movie! 
So many memorable scenes tou can never unsee once seen.
George really delivered I'm this movie. 
I recommend special edition Blue rey .
Watch as much behind the scenes and making of this movie as possible and you will love it as much as I do. 
BEST LIGHTSABER BATTLE OF ALL TIME!"
"Jan 09, 2018",4,"Pretty much what you expect after 1,2,4-6. Hayden Christensen staring at you without emotions, but luckily the other actors deliver. The story is not new to anyone, but the lightsabre duels are still remarkable. A good action movie in the great Star Wars universe."
"Jan 09, 2018",4,The best of the prequels.
"Jan 08, 2018",4,"The prequels are a terrific return to the Star Wars universe. People do not appreciate the task of creating the entire universe in which the original Star Wars story takes place. In ROTS experiencing the paralyzing manipulation that the Sith Lord so patiently executed on Anakin, patsies like Jar Jar, and the government ring very true to the real world from history to current world conditions. Yes, the younglings slaughter for this type of movie was too much and completely unnecessary. They could have survived and been grouped with the list of Jedi the empire hunted done over the years prior to ANH."
"Jan 07, 2018",5,Everything I wanted to see growing up as a Star Wars fan.  Lightsaber duels happen frequently.  Loved it!
"Jan 07, 2018",5,"A dark and tragic Star Wars story that brings the prequel trilogy to a satisfying conclusion. George Lucas' endless imagination finally meets the original, beloved story from the originals."
"Jan 06, 2018",4,"This movie was a massive improvement from the other two prequels. The story felt more compelling and there was more action. It is by no means a perfect movie, i was a little disappointed by some aspects of the story that could have been written better."
"Jan 05, 2018",5,better than the new disney stuff
"Jan 05, 2018",5,"I was angry about the original trilogy ""special edition"" when the prequel trilogy was released, and I didn't gave these a fair chance at the time. In contrast now to Kennedyfilm's fake sequels, George Lucas's prequels shine. Love Palpatine especially in this episode."
"Jan 05, 2018",5,"A modern day greek tragedy. The fall of democracy, that couldnt be more relevant nowadays, with an incredible Ian Mcdiarmid, make this movie the deepest, darkest and best Star Wars ever. 
Order 66 and the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker move this movie as far away from the classic hero's journey as possible.
But that´s what makes George Lucas a genious, he doesn't rely on nostalgia, he doesn't create a movie for fans. He has a vision in his head and he bravely realises it. 
The more Star wars movies Disney will create, the more people will learn to appreciate this masterpiece, i'm convinced of that."
"Jan 05, 2018",5,"A fantastic movie. So much better than the tedious first two prequels for many reasons:

1. The acting is far better, in particular Hayden Christensen, who perfectly depicts the stubborn and dark character of Anakin Skywalker. However, the standout performance, is Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine. At first kind, yet controlling. We see the evolution of his character from the perceived innocent chancellor to the Sith Lord who was hiding all along. Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson also put in good performances, though Natalie Portman's isn't incredible.

2. This film embraces the dark side fully, creating a magnificently horrifying atmosphere, in particular at the end of the film when Anakin slaughters the younglings. This film embraces the dark aspects of Anakin far more than the previous two ever did, making it a gripping watch.

3. Fantastic scenes. Revenge of the Sith contains multiple fantastic scenes which are not only gripping, but provide context and feeling to Anakin's journey. In particular, the end scene on Mustafar in which Obi Wan Kenobi and his former Padawan Anakin duel is fantastically designed. As is the opener of the film in which Anakin murders Count Dooku on Palpatines request.

In conclusion, these are just 3 reasons as to why this is a great film. Though, the dialogue lets it down, it is still a Star Wars classic."
"Jan 04, 2018",5,"I completely LOVE this movie - always have - from beginning to end, totally epic, totally memorable. You see the culmination of Anakin's betrayals - those who betrayed him (the Jedi counsel, the chancellor/Palpatine), and those he betrayed, out of fear of losing his wife. So heartbreakingly tragic for everyone - except the Emperor, of course, he got everything he wanted. The novelization (while no longer 'canon' I believe), gives a lot more beautiful in-depth to the characters."
"Jan 03, 2018",4,"Successfully ends the prequel trilogy, learning from earlier mistakes. This film is Lucas's best of the 4 he directed (yes, including a new hope, watch it again you'll see how the writing is better). Ewan McGregor is still fantastic, but there's enough faults with Hayden and Portman, though not entirely their own fault."
"Jan 03, 2018",4.5,The best of the prequels.
"Jan 02, 2018",4.5,By far the best of 1-3. Besides some lackluster plot points that had to be carried on from episodes 1 &amp; 2 this movie performed suprisingly well.
"Jan 02, 2018",5,This was the best Star Wars movie ever. It perfectly ties together all of the prequels and originals in one brilliant film that harkens back to the story telling of the ancient greek dramas and the most majestic operas. Truly a masterpiece.
"Jan 02, 2018",4.5,One of the best Star Wars movies ever.
"Jan 02, 2018",5,"The best Star Wars movie considering the fact that the originals are way too old, but in comparison to the new rubbish Disney sequels, this is a superb movie from beginning to end. A master piece and one of my favorite movies ever; this is what SW is all about. Loved it"
"Jan 01, 2018",4.5,"Great Music... Great Visuals... Very Emotional... Ewan kills it as Obi-Wan... Ian kills it as Sidious... Most acting is better... Story is very compelling... George Lucas really amped it up in this Episode - he should not receive as much negativity as he did... Almost every scene has something going for it... I would only remove about 5 minutes of footage from the movie or change a couple of things... Examples: Not all, but the balcony scene cringe dialogue ""chuckle no only because I'm so in love with you"" part (leave the rest before cutting to the Force vision scene)... I'd also make Obi-Wan dispatch Grievous with a Lightsaber... And possibly the ""Nooo"" scene re-filmed better maybe while destroying the room... 4.25 Stars.."
"Dec 31, 2017",5,One of the greatest Star Wars film due its modern touch and charisma!
"Dec 31, 2017",3.5,"Too violent for some people, but still an enjoyable Star Wars film."
"Dec 31, 2017",5,"Amazing film, a true star wars story."
"Dec 31, 2017",3,Generally ok. But certainly lost interest after the film before. Meant had little interest in what happens to the characters. And the continuation to Episode 4 was poorly written. Lazy attempt of linking back to the original Star Wars. Character development was thin and jumped. Action was fun to watch at least and acting had improved by this point in the prequels
"Dec 30, 2017",0.5,The Prequels: the more serious they try to be the worse they get. 
"Dec 29, 2017",5,Classic. Simply the Best.
"Dec 29, 2017",5,Way better then the last Jedi. The fight in this movie where great. Obi wan is the Man. Best of the prequels and Head and Shoulders above the Last Jedi
"Dec 29, 2017",2.5,"Not as bad as Phantom or Clones, but bad"
"Dec 29, 2017",4.5,"Ewan McGregor was the highlight of this one for me. Would have enjoyed seeing Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen with the same story line, but better directing."
"Dec 29, 2017",5,Best movie from the prequels !!
"Dec 29, 2017",3,"5&gt;4&gt;6&gt;&gt;7&gt;R1&gt;3&gt;1&gt;2&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;8

While its not comparable to the OT it is still the best of the prequels. Liked it as a kid, still enjoy it today. At last we see the transformation of Anakin to Vader and the forming of the empire. Yes the story in itself isnt the best, yes the cgi is just too much and yes Grievous was a joke. But at least this film tells a story, keeps the viewer interested and has characters you actually care about. Thats why this movie is with all its flaws still far better than the mess that is The Last Jedi."
"Dec 28, 2017",0.5,dont't be fooled.  It sucked just as bas as the other 2
"Dec 28, 2017",3.5,Better than Disney Wars
"Dec 28, 2017",4,My apologies to George Lucas.  His prequels tower above Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi
"Dec 28, 2017",5,This is so much better than people give it credit for.
"Dec 28, 2017",1,You Were The Chosen One!
"Dec 27, 2017",1.5,The best of the dreaded Lucas prequels. (Not saying much =/ )
"Dec 27, 2017",5,"The best of the Prequels, one of the best of the saga."
"Dec 27, 2017",3.5,Best in the trilogy.
"Dec 27, 2017",5,"Just love the movie, this is the best installment of SW universe for me)"
"Dec 27, 2017",3.5,"Despite the mediocre star rating, this was still my favorite of the Prequel (Anakin) trilogy of films.

It served as a faithful, somewhat believable connector to A New Hope. The decline of Anakin is more or less believable and can get some emotions going. However, I suspect some punches were pulled because younger viewers wouldn't understand the subtleties that would have made us feel it more deeply.

Yoda's retreat still feels a bit... premature and unexplained. That could have used a bit more work.

Overall, a respectable and enjoyable chapter in the canon."
"Dec 27, 2017",5,"This movie getting poor reviews is completely insulting to the Star Wars franchise. This movie was a masterpiece. Constant action, drama, and storyline advancement. Truly one of the greatest in the entire saga."
"Dec 26, 2017",5,Best Star Wars film of all time!! Tons of light saber fights. Something the new Star Wars trilogy if failing in.
"Dec 26, 2017",4.5,"Although the prequels are not very good in general, this movie is really good in my opinion. Epic, powerful and a good concousion to the original trilogy."
"Dec 26, 2017",5,"Excellent movie. Saw it in theaters when it came out, I was but a younglin at the time. Don't know why so many dislike it this reminds me of simpler days, when I was a child."
"Dec 25, 2017",1.5,"It didn't *totally* ruin the franchise, but it fell far short of what it could have been. Hayden Christiansen still stinks, but the horrible script seems like it was a chore to write, and it felt awfully dry even weeks after seeing it the first time. It was awkward, forced (not *that* Force), and poorly paced. Easily the worst of the lot."
"Dec 25, 2017",2.5,"Acting is as bad as in episode II., but Anakin and Padme are not main characters so its bearable. Action and Ewan McGregor are only positives of this movie..."
"Dec 24, 2017",4,The only watchable movie of the 1-3 series and it was miles above those two
"Dec 24, 2017",5,Best Star Wars movie y
"Dec 24, 2017",5,A few scenes could have been better but one of my favorites.
"Dec 24, 2017",4.5,"You would think the entire prequel trilogy would have been trash. This is a work of art compared to the others. That half star is only because of jar jar binks, but well done!"
"Dec 24, 2017",4,best of the prequels.
"Dec 24, 2017",5,"So many people bash the prequel trilogy, but this has to be the best Star Wars ever."
"Dec 24, 2017",1,"The best of the prequels, but that's not saying much..."
"Dec 24, 2017",5,The dark side rises 
"Dec 23, 2017",5,"Amazing movie, my favorite in the series."
"Dec 23, 2017",3,"Character assassination of Vader complete! This is just stupid. I don't like the circumstances of Anakin's fall, I don't like the fall itself, I hate the role he plays in the purge; which is utter bullshit!; I hate the fight with Obi Wan (more below on that).
Film starts awesome and looks great. The fight with Dooku is a little weird but then I think Dooku is a bad character anyway. I think it would have been far better to have a character that was a blend of Maul and Dooku and keep him from episode I - III, but whatever.
Padme is character assassinated. She turns from a strong, independent (almost to a fault) woman into a woman who is just weak. Maybe this change is why Natalie Portman does such a terrible job of portraying her or it could be the God-awful dialog she is given.
I do like the story. The fall transition from republic to empire is well done and believable. The fall of the Jedi is again very believable and well done.
I think it's interesting how the Jedi's arrogance blinds them to some realities. It's also interesting that the Emperor is the one who delivers this line because you see the same thing happen to the Emperor in Return of the Jedi. 
The final fight - I guess it was almost impossible to meet expectations. I thought it was too choreographed. So much so that the fight was beyond belief. Continues the trend in this trilogy that a light-saber fight is a flashy light-show with almost no other force powers used. They try to force push a few times but no one every throws things in combination with an attack. There is much more potential there than what is shown I think. I don't think Vader's superiority was emphasized enough. 
I really dislike that Obi Wan wins this fight. (Personal Rant) I think Vader should have lost, not Obi Wan winning. The fact that with one swing Obi Wan takes off Vader's legs and saber arm is just laughable. How I saw this fight happening (as it unfolded) if Obi Wan fell or was knocked onto a platform that moved away from Vader. They have one of their little mid-fight chit-chats, and then Vader says this is the end for you but by this time the platform as moved too far away. Vader in undeterred to the belief that he is all powerful, Obi Wan tells him not to try, Vader does so anyway and falls. He falls to where he ends up near the lava flow and catches fire just as the movie shows. He arm and legs have to be amputated due to fall and burn damage not chopped off by Obi Wan. In this way Vader defeats himself. In my mind that is the fight and we were led to believe something like this. The producers said as much. Vader is a superior fighter to Obi Wan and Vader defeats himself. It's just my way is good and theirs is character assassination. That's why I dislike it.(end personal rant).

Highlight: The re-creation of Darth Vader. The surgery that put Vader in the suit is horrible, terrifying, incredible! One of ""The"" moments in Star Wars history...with one hiccup...""Nooooo!""
Why George? Why? (and he has since added the same stupid shit to ROTJ when Vader picks up the Emperor!!!).
An inarticulate cry would have served the purpose far better I think. A ""continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman - a howl - a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as might only have arisen out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the damned in their agony and of the daemons who exult in the damnation."" (Poe, E.; Black Cat).

Final: It's all here and without the character assassinations would have been on par with TESB. Instead its only number 4 on the list."
"Dec 23, 2017",5,"Revenge of the Sith is the final installment in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. It, without a doubt, certainly with out with a bang. 

The movie follows Anakin Skywalker's descent to the Dark Side and transformation into the Dark Side. Surprisingly, the movie is able to make Anakin a relatable character by making him turn to the Dark Side out of sheer desperation and powerlessness to save his wife, Padmé. In the words of director George Lucas, ""you can't have a monster turning into a monster. That's not a story."" Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan and Ian McDiarmid as the cunning Palpatine definitely turn in the standout performances of the film. Every scene with both of them is great!

The action and visual effects in the movie are, no question, the best in the saga. The movie starts off spectacularly with an epic space battle and ends with an intense lightsaber battle in which the characters are surrounded by fire. The sweeping shots of the city-planet Coruscant and other locales really elevate the cinematography of the film as well. That's not to say the movie isn't without its character moments. The scenes between Palpatine and Anakin and Anakin and Padmé help make the film's climax even more emotional than it would've been.

Time has definitely been kind to the darkest chapter of the Star Wars saga. In my opinion, it's the best film in the series and it's really not a contest."
"Dec 23, 2017",3.5,Again this movie falls prey to some really bad acting and cringy lines. However the plot and action will draw you in.
"Dec 22, 2017",4.5,"I happen to think this is a very fine movie.  Yes, the ""love"" dialogue can get quite ""cringey"".  But the opening 20+ minutes over Coruscant--awesome!!  The multiple lightsaber duels--exhilarating!  A deeper focus on plot and character is also wonderfully realized in this film.  It's a bit like a really, really good opera: yes, it can get a bit too grandiose for its own good.  But it also just so happens to be wildly entertaining, and a movie you'll want to watch again, again, and again!"
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"This movie feels more like Star Wars than the new films coming out. Depending on what they do with Episode 9, people may come back to these prequels and wish they never gave Lucas a hard time, because this may very well be as good as Star Wars will ever get."
"Dec 22, 2017",5,I really enjoyed this movie. Watched it 6 times in the theater when it was released. Answered so much and delivered some of the best moments with character villains and heroes within the Star Wars sagas.
"Dec 22, 2017",5,Best Star Wars stands out very well!!!
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"Compared to the Disney Destruction of the Star Wars Series with their Leftist SJW Agenda, THIS IS BRILLIANT!!"
"Dec 22, 2017",0.5,"One of the worst films I have ever seen. That neither the frantic, emotionless pacing, nor the passionless, video game art direction, are the worst part of this movie is a damning condemnation of it's dialog."
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"To be fair, the prequels (episodes 1-3) weren't so bad when compared with the the sequels (7-9). Of course though, nothing beats the Original Trilogy. (4-6)"
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"It is strange to rewatch these after seeing the Last Jedi.  I can't believe that the prequels seem so much better now after watching the Last Jedi.  The prequels have a clear story progression, character development, and make sense.  Lightsaber duels are awesome.  I originally didn't like the portrayal of Anaken in the prequels, but now it seems good compared to what is being created now."
"Dec 21, 2017",2,"(this review has Spoliers) While many liked Revenge of the Sith, this last installment of the prequels tells the story of Anakin path to the dark side, but again, it just seems to force the story told in the original saga, the original story line had clearly not been thought out, but this story suffers as a result, Leah can't have memories of her mother as in the original, she dies in childbirth.  Yet Lucas still insists on forcing many bits of the old narrative into this one even if it doesn't make much sense.  The turning of Anakin into a child killing monster just doesn't fit with his motivation of trying to save his beloved  padme or his path to the dark side by placing his trust in a Sith lord just because he tells Anakin that he can save her, (I mean really, he isn't going to go to the Jedi to see if he can get a better offer? seek Yoda advice?)  He is going to turn on Mace Wandu on the off chance the emperor might be able to help him for a yet unknown future malady that Padme may contract? And after the Emperor clearly reneges on his promise, Vader seems completely ok with it. The story line is convoluted the characters motivation are unclear, its like you see the direction Lucas wants to take the movie but we end up in a strange place where odd things happen.  Obiwan leaves his apprentice and friend to die because he can't bring him to kill him, but won't call for help or at least try to give him medical attention?  He clearly is defeated and unable to defend himself.  It just seems like Obiwan would know better.  All in all, we are left with an uneven, plodding mess of a movie, a shadow of what could have been."
"Dec 21, 2017",3,"While uneven and boring at most times, George Lucas concludes this disappointing trilogy with a fine sendoff, and more entertaining action sequences."
"Dec 21, 2017",4,"Hayden Christensen's poor acting carries over into this movie, but his performance was overall stronger than in Attack of the Clones. Again, he was given some very poor dialogue to work with at times. Lots of great action spread across the galaxy in exotic locations. Probably the best lightsaber duel in all of Star Wars' cinematic history."
"Dec 21, 2017",2.5,"Pleasantly surprised about this one. It 's still full of verbal diarrhea, enormous plot-holes and unexplained events but, for a Star Wars fan the last hour is a huge improvement on anything that came before.
Forgivable and the only watchable prequel but that's about it."
"Dec 21, 2017",5,"Unlike the recent movies, this movie fills in the story of a beloved Saga. The acting could have been better. But the whole point of Star Wars is to be engaged in a fantasy that follows the story of the Skywalkers, the Jedi Order, and the rise and fall of the Evil Empire. If one doesn't like the story then I understand. But for those of us that love the Star Wars Saga, this film was the perfect movie to answer the all important question of how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader."
"Dec 21, 2017",4,"Although it has it's share of awkward moments, the sheer scope and potential of the story Lucas tried to tell in this movie is enough to carry it to a dramatic climax. The movie also has it's clever and sharp moments which makes it a joy to watch again."
"Dec 21, 2017",5,This is a star wars movie! The best in the entire saga I say!
"Dec 21, 2017",5,A satisfying conclusion to the story of Star Wars. It did what it needed to do from a narrative standpoint.
"Dec 20, 2017",4,The action makes up for some poor lines. This film stood out from the rest of the trilogy.
"Dec 20, 2017",5,My favorite SWs film
"Dec 20, 2017",5,Most important Star Wars movie ever made.
"Dec 20, 2017",5,an absolute thrill to watch! Star Wars perfection!
"Dec 20, 2017",5,Best Star Wars Movie!
"Dec 20, 2017",3,"This is easily the best prequel Star wars film. Revenge of the Sith gives us an interesting prospective of the creation of Darth Vader and the ongoing manipulation by Palpetine. Although the film suffers with boring talking scenes and poor CGI effects, i can't deny that this film is still a fun watch. 

Final Score 7/10"
"Dec 20, 2017",5,Best Star Wars film thus far.
"Dec 20, 2017",0.5,"What could have redeemed the prequels is left somewhere on the cutting room floor.  Over dependence on CG, clunky dialog and generally a poor execution of how one might fall to the darkside.   Pacing was a problem from early on.  There was tons of ground to cover - was hopeful during the initial duel between Dooku and Anikan that we would get Vader early - but that is stalled again.  And is then crammed into the last half of the film.   There were a lot of places to synch up with, and no differing point of views explain why people in the original series describe events so differently.  People have blamed the cast, but I honestly don't think they even knew what they were making with the many different takes for scenes.  We have seen all of these actors rock outside of Star Wars.  Would love to get my hands on the raw footage to see if this could have been salvaged.  This film does not have the higher ground."
"Dec 20, 2017",5,A legendary movie with fascinating action in every turn.
"Dec 20, 2017",3.5,"The final act of this movie is amazing, and one of George Lucas' finest works. The drama works wonderously, and the acting is superior to everything else George Lucas directed for the prequels. I wish the rest of the prequels were handled with as much love and care as the last act of this movie."
"Dec 20, 2017",5,Watching The Last Jedi made me appreciate George Lucas' work and to re-evaluate his prequel movies. They are excellent in comparison to the Disney Star Wars movies.
"Dec 20, 2017",5,"best star wars movie, next to return of the jedi"
"Dec 20, 2017",5,My personal favourite movie of all time.
"Dec 20, 2017",3.5,"The best of the second trilogy by far. However, the acting was still horrendous (almost as if by design). Ultimately though, the two storylines of both trilogies were tied together without too much conflict, and the film was rewarding enough that I'm still interested in seeing Episode VII."
"Dec 20, 2017",5,"The lore and mystery of the Star Wars Universe is deepened in satisfying ways. Although some brief moments don't land quite right, the heart of the franchise is found in the action, spectacle and in the emotional climax - rich with memorable settings, dialogue, and thrills."
"Dec 20, 2017",5,"Episode 3 is My favorite starwars movie. This movie Grabs you from the very opening and doesn't let go until the very end, it keep you on the edge of your seat, and is a fantastic last ride for the series. If you didn't like this movie than you're just an Original Trilogy Fanboy and you're the main reason why George Sold Starwars To Disney and now Street wars is ruined."
"Dec 20, 2017",5,I love this movie it was an excellent way of ending the prequels we have a fully and understanding of what turn out to be Darth Vader
"Dec 19, 2017",4,"Not only the best of the Star Wars prequels, but a masterpiece in it's own right with only a few silly moments left over from AOTC and TPM"
"Dec 19, 2017",3,59%; at best; Surprising that a good story could turn out this bad; painfully campy dialogue negatively impacting otherwise good actors. Horrible CGI. Tough to watch by and large when it had such potential
"Dec 19, 2017",3.5,"More competent than the previous 2 movies, acting not great but certainly better especially in Obi Wan and Palpatine, emotional ending, more exciting and better paced, fairly enjoyable and about as good and this trilogy could expect for a finale"
"Dec 19, 2017",5,"This movie is emotional, beautiful, and has the best lightsaber fight in the whole Skywalker Saga. (Come at me, Battle of the Fates lovers!) Obi-Wan is incredible, and Ewan does amazing work for this movie."
"Dec 19, 2017",5,My favorite Star Wars movie
"Dec 19, 2017",5,"Good plot, acting is a lot better than in the other prequel movies, love the strong emotion in this film, great character development especially in Anakin Skywalker, just a great movie and it’s my favorite Star Wars movie ever made. If you love Star Wars, you’ll definitely love this movie. "
"Dec 19, 2017",5,"Loved the story! Not too impressed by cinematography unfortunately. But to see Anakin’s downfall into the iconic Darth Vader was truly satisfying and heartbreaking! Great action and awesome, just awesome lightsaber fights! Always wanted to see that. My heart was broken by the end even though I knew it would end like that! I loved how the prequels expanded the universe. Thank you George Lucas! "
"Dec 19, 2017",2.5,The best of the prequels. But that isn't really a high standard.
"Dec 19, 2017",4,"And epic conclusion to the Prequel trilogy, this movie manages to really carry the 2nd trilogy, although the a few of the line falter and this movie could use another 10 minutes character development it still manages to to pull of Darth Vader transformation (although a little bit is left desired hence the need of a few extra scenes)  Overall this movie does a good job showing the end of the clone wars and explaining what it was all along, and sets up the empire and the end of the jedi well, the best characters are the emperor and Obi Wan the actors did a good job with them.  The love story from the 2nd film still kinda feels cheesy in this film but holds up a little better this time."
"Dec 18, 2017",5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Amazing
"Dec 18, 2017",0.5,Somehow the acting got even worse than Episode II.
"Dec 18, 2017",5,Amazing movie not sure why everyone of course has to give it a bad rating mabey because it's part of the prequels and the other 2 aren't good.
"Dec 18, 2017",3,"Despite McDiarmid and McGregor's valiant efforts to bring serious pathos and gravitas to the screen in the final prequel film, the movie falls flat for me amidst a glut of green screen scenery and stale performances by Christensen and Porter's leading romantic roles. There are beautiful moments hidden here, but they are buried beneath a heavy-handed and simplistic plot of political intrigue set against a computer-generated backdrop as artificial as the dialogue."
"Dec 18, 2017",5,"Love it, connects to 4 beautifully! :) Makes me happy."
"Dec 18, 2017",4,Good movie overall. They could of chosen a better actor to play Anakin as his dark side turn wasn't convincing.
"Dec 18, 2017",4.5,"Christensen does the best he can with what Lucas gives him. McGregor, McDiarmid, they shine in by far the most redeemable part of the prequel trilogy. Dialogue cheesy as it is...there's no denying there is emotional feeling in the final battle between Vader and Kenobi."
"Dec 18, 2017",5,"dark, gritty, creative. I love it"
"Dec 18, 2017",4.5,Amazing movie with gorgeous visuals and an awesome story. I think Hayden Christensen did a good job portraying Darth Vader in this film. The film to me is the darkest and most action packed movie of the saga. Overall it's a very satisfying end the the prequel trilogy.
"Dec 18, 2017",3.5,Great lightsaber battles and finally the story that you have been waiting for saves a movie with horrible CGI
"Dec 18, 2017",4,"Other than Anakin's greasy long hair, enjoyed this one!

Another happy landing."
"Dec 18, 2017",3.5,"Puntaje Original: 6.5

Mejor que sus predecesoras, pero no tan espectacular como la trilogía original."
"Dec 18, 2017",5,"I really enjoyed this movie, best of the prequels. The acting got better, CGI was better, and this movie was really dark and took some risks. This movie was filled with action and fun lightsaber fights. The thing I liked best from this movie was Palpatine. The part that was bad for me was Vader yelling ""NOOO!"" at the end."
"Dec 18, 2017",4.5,Amazing movie. One of the best in the entire saga!

"Dec 18, 2017",5,Absolutely love it. The ending scene gave me chills. It is good to see Vader back.
"Dec 18, 2017",5,My favorite Star Wars movie. So emotional and a great plot twist!
"Dec 18, 2017",0.5,"ROTS is putrid trash. The whole intro looks like a reject from Clone Wars cartoon show, a hideous dated CGI mess. Dialogue looks like it comes from actors who actually think you're enjoying that ghastly script. 

The long and pointless kidnap plot was a poorly written contrived chore. It's followed by ...many boring scenes from extensions of old set pieces of AOTC. The rest of the movie... was uhh... repulsive and shrill. Where to start, the shrieking performance of a child predator who wears a Halloween mask and a little red dress. That was disgusting. Explanation for character motivations was just as lacking as in other movies. Its depressing, ugly, and dark. There's nothing in it to enjoy. Its a catastrophe. Looks like a bad Saturday morning cartoon infused with poorly-conceived Star Wars characters.  

But at the end, they treated the audience to yet even more spectacles of light sabers. This was perhaps to provide excitement to this vapid and lazy pile of puke. They couldn't even do a single Darth Vader scene right. That sucked too. None of these prequels are remotely worthy of preceding the original SW movies. TPM is probably the best. Yes, Star Wars C-SPAN was the best one.

Instead of Imperial cruisers and tie fighters, we got recycled diarrhea from the reject bin. Could have included an exciting scene of the early rebel alliance. Perhaps a final light saber battle in a rebel base being barraged by the Empire. But for that, you'd need good writers who don't take their material from 1980s cartoons."
"Dec 17, 2017",2.5,"The only prequel worth bothering with, and even then there's a lot of cringeworthy dreck to wade through. But Ian McDiarmid's Emperor earns his due, and almost singlehandedly carries this film."
"Dec 17, 2017",4,Compared to the last Jedi this is GOLD. It was not perfect but it was fun and helped tie together the two trilogies. 
"Dec 17, 2017",4,"Significantly better than 1 and 2, Revenge of the Sith offers everything a Star Wars fans love. Terrific action sequences and awesome saber battles to match a terrific drama having a hero turn villain. Definitely some great performances especially from Ian McDiarmid, Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen makes Revenge of the Sith one of the best in the franchise. "
"Dec 17, 2017",4,"Best of the 1-3 trilogy by far, connects nicely to the story we all know already, McGregor is fantastic in this one. Great final fight scene, and what Anakin did to the younglings shows he is now Dark Side without question."
"Dec 17, 2017",2,Seems like a huge leap of faith...
"Dec 17, 2017",3,"This is the best out of all the prequel movies. Having grown up with these movies I may be a little bias due to the fact. The actors do their best do portray their characters due to the lack of good dialogue provided by George Lucas. There really is not much to talk about in this movie other than the end, which I think is highly underrated. The lightsaber duel, Oh my god, it was awesome, if there is anything you should take out of this movie its, the lightsaber duel between Obi Wan and Anakin. In the end this is an okay movie, it gives a great entertainment value, but it lacks in the awful CGI effects and bad dialogue."
"Dec 17, 2017",4,"Best of the prequels, nearly best of the franchise. A fitting end."
"Dec 17, 2017",5,"So emotionally powerful. Even now after 12 years I still get sad, angry and excited when I watch this film. Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader is so perfect with it culiminating into him Force choking Padme and eventually being dismembered and burned nearly to death. With the addition of John Williams iconic score the fall of the Jedi is captured in one very sad and memorable scene. Some fans find the scene at the temple (when Anakin's kills the younglings) to be too dark but do not. Anakin's truly believes that the Jedi are evil and have betrayed him. Also, Palpatine told him that he must show no mercy in order to be strong enough in the dark side to save Padme. All in all Revenge of the Sith is still my favorite Star Wars film and probably always will be."
"Dec 17, 2017",5,My favorite of the original trilogy.  True star wars action at its core.  Arguably the best light saber fight of all time.  Yea the script is as bad as the others but at its core it is what we needed and helped finish the connection between Anakin and Vader.
"Dec 17, 2017",5,Totally underrated...this Episode is dark af and rocks.
"Dec 17, 2017",5,Best Star Wars movie. Most fighting and most plot ever 
"Dec 17, 2017",5,Very good movie! This is a Star Wars movie. Obi Wan is the hero and perhaps the greatest Jedi!
"Dec 17, 2017",3.5,"Numerically speaking, this is where it gets good. I’m a big fan of ‘Revenge’, with what I think is solid but not perfect fading into the original trilogy, as well as an awesome fight scene that drags through the final act of the movie. "
"Dec 17, 2017",3.5,"A good film, but not quite a great one. Anakin’s decent to the dark side felt somewhat rushed and bizarre at times. It’s almost as if this film should have been a two parter. The final scene with Vader was laughable, that could have been handled better. I actually thought Haden Christiansen was just fine in this movie, he played the part well. A less congested fight scene with Sidious and the Jedi would have been preferred. In total it’s still a good watch and accomplished the important goal of successfully bridging he two trilogies."
"Dec 17, 2017",5,Far better than the new crap being pumped out by Disney.
"Dec 16, 2017",5,Arguably my favorite Star Wars film. It's very close between this and Empire Strikes Back. Episode 5 has the slight edge for me. This is by far the darkest star wars film full of terror that isn't for all children. I would say this one was more for adults who like darkness and betrayal. It was wondrous to behold. One of my favorite films of all time. Sad to see it with such bad reviews.
"Dec 16, 2017",5,"Great movie. Best of the Prequels, better than the sequels. 10/10 This movie is where the fun begins"
"Dec 16, 2017",4.5,loved it my fav out of the prequels
"Dec 16, 2017",5,"For me, it's the best Star Wars movie ever. :)"
"Dec 16, 2017",4,"The very best of the Prequels

this movie makes up for the short falls of it's two prequels. The two previous films didn't really fell like I was watching a star wars movie, instead they felt more like star wars spin offs that should have been called ""This Young Obi-Won &amp; Anakin Adventures"".

However this is not true of Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.

Revenge of the Sith manages to capture all of the Star Wars energy and all of its glory. this movie rocks the house. the music and special effects are excellent. The acting is good, and the story is great. I have already seen this film 4 times at the theater, and I cannot wait to own a copy of this for my own personal DVD collection, this will be one of those rare movies that I will be watching over and over again (and loving it more each time) As time marches on, there is no doubt in my mind that this movie will soon leave episode I &amp; II in the dust and join the same ranks as episodes IV,V,&amp; VI as one of the all time great sci-fi masterpeices"
"Dec 16, 2017",4,"With average dialogue, sketchy green screen work, and a director who has lost touch, Star Wars EP lll manages to provide a thrilling and exciting transition of Anakin Skywalker to becoming Darth Vader. Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) &amp; Hayden Christensen (Anakin, Darth Vader) are exceptional."
"Dec 16, 2017",3.5,"This movie is easily the best of the prequels, but not without its flaws, it’s dragged down by the poor script. The CGI is much better and the action scenes are some of the best of the whole saga."
"Dec 16, 2017",4,Revenge of the Sith finally captures the story the prequels wanted to tell all along. The film is the only one in the trilogy that feels like a real movie. Everything that was criticized in Attack of the Clones is a lot better here.
"Dec 16, 2017",3.5,A good movie to end the horrible prequel trilogy.
"Dec 16, 2017",0.5,"A terrible movie with bad effects, bad story, bad acting, cringe worthy dialogue and some just flat out dumb moements"
"Dec 16, 2017",5,Best Star Wars movie! It was the darkest one yet. It led up perfectly to the originals. And it was much better than that garbage The Last Jedi 
"Dec 16, 2017",0.5,"Bad!! George Lucas is unfortunately a very bad detektor.. All of the Star wars novices he has derected is very bad, except the first Star wars movie."
"Dec 16, 2017",5,Best star wars movie ever period.
"Dec 16, 2017",5,"Fourth best movie ever. A little clunky on the dialog perhaps, but all in all a thoroughly enjoyable movie that more than makes up for it in every other way."
"Dec 16, 2017",3.5,"Bad acting, but some of the best battles in the saga."
"Dec 16, 2017",5,Way better than The Last Jedi
"Dec 16, 2017",4,"Finally, a prequel I enjoyed. Looking back on these prequels, the only story Lucas had was the fall of Anakin. So he should have made Episode I about Anakin as Obi-Wan's apprentice who was on the verge of becoming a full fledged knight. Take it from there. There was no need to go with 8 year old Ani. Oh well. This film makes up for the rest of the PT and the showdown between Obi and Ani was worth it."
"Dec 15, 2017",4,The only prequel worth watching. Some of the best battles of the franchise not to mention the fall of a great hero to darkness and the rise of an even better villain. The birth of one the greatest villains in cinematic history.
"Dec 15, 2017",4.5,"Visualization/Effects (Practical/Special) - 9/10
Acting - 8/10
Sound/Music - 8/10
Film Storyline - 9/10
Trilogy Continuity - 9/10

Overall - 8.6/10

Episode III caps off the Prequel Trilogy in an amazing way and lines up with the Original Trilogy effortlessly.  The chamber scene where Anakin Skywalker mulls his fate where we can hear the amazing score from John Williams and Ian's Sidious' influence in the background gave me goosebumps.  The lightsaber duel between Skywalker and Kenobi was breathtaking!"
"Dec 15, 2017",5,Best action for a Star Wars movie
"Dec 15, 2017",5,"Best Star Wars movie, really like that darkness."
"Dec 15, 2017",5,This was a great film.
"Dec 15, 2017",1.5,This movie... has the LOW ground!
"Dec 15, 2017",4,Better then episode 8
"Dec 15, 2017",5,"Great movie, my favourite of the Star Wars saga"
"Dec 15, 2017",5,"Revenge of the Sith is actually one of my favorite Star Wars movies. This conclusion of the prequels is, in my opinion, stronger than the conclusion of the originals (The Return of the Jedi). True the dialogue is not the best and the CGI can get a little annoying, but the overall story is excellent and it wraps into the originals very well. 
The movie follows the fall of the Republic and the rise of both the Empire and the Sith that we all know and love from the Originals. Throughout the movie there is a deep sense of dread, a knowing that things are going to go bad real quick. The music helps in that regard throughout the whole movie. Ian MacDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine puts on an excellent performance. I feel the character of Palpatine/Sidious in this movie is one of the best characters in the whole Star Wars franchise. You sense the real power that Palpatine has and his mastery of both the Force and the political scene. His workings on Anakin are also superb. 
The film features no less than four lightsaber combats. All of them are pretty good. There is the epic Anakin and Obi Wan fight that did not disappoint. Neither did the Yoda and Sidious battle. You feel the full weight of Anakin's fall when he slaughters children and enemy political leaders. You sense real fear looking in Anakin's eyes when he looks back at you with the Sith yellow eyes. 
If you enjoy political intrigue and want a good explanation of why the universe is the way it is in a New Hope, Sith does not disappoint."
"Dec 15, 2017",4.5,"Very Underrated. The Only flaw is that the movie has parts of cheesy dialog, and needs a extra 15min of development. The rest is Perfect. Love This Movie so much. Top 2 and The best soundtrack so Far."
"Dec 13, 2017",2,"Revenge of the Sith is a painfully poor attempt to wrap up all the previously attempted character development that is debatably the worst film in the prequel trilogy. 

When all the story and character beats lead to the moment we're all waiting for, it plays out and falls apart in a matter of seconds. Characters make decisions they seem to be forced into by the writer, despite having obvious and obtainable options.  

When presented with his fulcrum, Anakin Skywalker enters a room with intentions and a mind set we can understand. Most of all, his character has options. So many possible options. Instead, he falls to his knees, pledges his aliegence to the almighty Galactic Empire and proceeds to kill children because ""it's the only way"" 

It does not get much more contrived than this. 
Everything in this film happens because the writer says so, just as easily as he can type the first thought that comes into his head, not because the writer or characters have earned anything. 

Episode III is a painful conclusion to an overall awkward trilogy of films."
"Dec 13, 2017",3.5,"Revenge of the Sith is, by most accounts, the best film of George Lucas' Star Wars prequel trilogy. Both people who like or loathe the prequels seem to at least agree on that. Even as somebody who doesn't mind this trilogy as much as others, I can admit that it is a step up from The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. Watching it after having watched Episodes I and II does give the feeling that Lucas finally started listening to some of the criticisms lobbied against these movies. The story has a more streamlined feel and moves more cohesively than its predecessors. That doesn't mean some of the previous downfalls aren't present here. Despite having a talented cast, some of the performances aren't the best, most notably Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman. That isn't their fault, but again, they weren't given much direction to work with. Ian McDiarmid, though mostly superb in his role as Chancellor-turned-Emperor Palpatine, does come across as a cartoonish villain in a few moments. Additionally, Anakin Skywalker's turn to Darth Vader almost feels abrupt, even though it had been built towards for two and a half movies. However, there is still much to enjoy here. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi is great again, and in this go-around it does feel like he finally plays an important part of the plot as opposed to just ""being there."" The action here is great and arguably the best of this trilogy. Perhaps what helps a lot more people enjoy this film is how well it synced up at the end to the original, A New Hope (that is, until we got Rogue One 11 years later). Maybe that nostalgia is the main reason people like Revenge of the Sith over the two movies that came before. Either way, what can giving Episode III a try (or another try) hurt?"
"Dec 12, 2017",3,"Definitely a step above it's preceding Star Wars prequels. Hayden Christensen redeemed himself to provide a powerful performance as Anakin that portrays a great transition into the most iconic villain in cinematic history. CGI and some other acting is questionable, but an overall entertaining spectacle."
"Dec 12, 2017",3.5,"The best of the prequels by far, finally giving us what we wanted to see all along which is how Anakin became Vader. It is still ridden with bad character dialogue and wooden acting, but it captures the spirit of the originals in a way the prior two films could not. A solid ending to a lesser trilogy."
"Dec 11, 2017",5,This is my long term goal to help get the ratings of the prequels to be more than at least one of the other movies
"Dec 11, 2017",3.5,"Decent, better than the first two, being more interesting and moving at a faster pace giving us more story."
"Dec 11, 2017",3.5,"Revenge of the Sith is easily the best installment of the Prequel Trilogy and what The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones should have been. The visuals are spectacular, light saber battles are satisfying (yet highly choreographed with all the jumps and twirls), the battles of the Clone Wars fit the narrative of the story, and features the eventual fall of Anakin Skywalker. It feels like an actual Star Wars film and not like an incoherent mess of the previous Prequel Trilogy installments. But it's not without saying that they rushed Anakin's fall to the Dark Side and delegated his purpose of doing so to save Padme's life. Despite that, the final battle between him and Obi-Wan is an emotional battle, one full of betrayal and misguided rage. The ending does a competent job of segueing its way into the Original Trilogy. Overall, despite the rushed development of Anakin's fall, this movie is a worthy installment in the Star Wars saga."
"Dec 10, 2017",3,"I enjoyed it but not quite as much as the first movie, 
Why I didn't enjoy it that much is because of the final
battle was a bit silly. Was it flawed? Yes . Why was it flawed, Because the way they executed the story was
bad"
"Dec 09, 2017",5,It was basically a Star Wars Version of The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King.
"Dec 09, 2017",4.5,"As Darth Vader himself said in the original 1977 classic: The circle is now complete. George Lucas finally returns to top form, with the most diligent and ambitious film of this trilogy, both in terms of narrative and direction. The visuals have never looked better, the choreography for the lightsaber duels are highly impressive, and the tone is darker than the franchise has ever been. There are many awe-inspiring scenes throughout, but nothing is more exciting as seeing our favorite little green badass stand up to the despicable Emperor. McGreggor also confirms that he took a substantial role in carrying this entire trilogy, displaying more emotion in Obi-Wan than has ever been shown before. The story of Anakin's fall and Vader's rise is most certainly worthy, by having a true sense of Greek tragedy and Shakespearean irony that the franchise has never emulated in any other film. 'Episode III' is a fine end to the prequel trilogy, and a great lead-in to the original one. "
"Dec 08, 2017",3.5,"Episode III mainly is what it is -- the climax of a sometimes grand adventure that's more than the sum of its parts, yet much less than it might have been"
"Dec 07, 2017",4,Good ending to original trilogy. 
"Dec 03, 2017",4.5,"A really seriously entertaining movie, with flaws but not so major a huge improvement over the other prequels in every department by a mile and quite underated"
"Dec 03, 2017",3.5,A lot of info crammed in one film. It's well worth it. Just a lot happening. So keep up
"Nov 26, 2017",3,"The original series comes full circle and we finally learn what exactly drove Anakin Skywalker to turn to the Dark Side of the Force and become Darth Vader.  When all was said and done, I found myself not all that impressed.  Hayden Christensen is just as terrible as Anakin as he was in ""Attack of the Clones"".  He again has zero chemistry with Natalie Portman.  Pretty much nothing has changed here.  However I have given this movie a higher rating because it does have its positive moments.  The biggest is Yoda who steals the show here as he did in the previous movie.  It was also nice to see the home planet of the Wookies.  Again we see some very compelling moments that make the movie worth seeing.  For me one of the most compelling moments was seeing Anakin being placed in the armored black suit.  The best scene in the whole movie for me.  I liked this movie.  That's it, just liked it.  However it could have been a lot better."
"Nov 26, 2017",5,"Very underrated film.  Far better than the other two prequel films, and far superior to The Force Awakens.  There are some obvious plot points that were left on the cutting room floor that would have made this film far more compelling.  But as a whole, this film is excellent."
"Nov 24, 2017",4.5,An all-time favorite with some of the best battle you've ever seen
"Nov 22, 2017",5,"Not the best direction, and the dialogue is laughable at times. But in the end, the score, the story, the characters, everything comes full circle."
"Nov 21, 2017",3,Out of all the prequals this is the one that is decent. The originals are still way better though.
"Nov 18, 2017",3.5,"Certainly the best film of the prequel trilogy. Revenge of the Sith finally closes the trilogy, and answers many questions the first trilogy gave us. Despite this, the film wasn't perfect, as it still had many flaws. But the most exciting aspect of the film was how much it improved over its predecessors. The dialogue was still unnatural, and the love story wasn't fun to watch, but the actual plot was enjoyable."
"Nov 13, 2017",4,"Revenge of the Sith is definitely the best prequel. It fixes almost all mistakes done through the first two movies. This movie is emotional, dark, well-driven, and the story is excellent. Anakin Skywalker is a complete step-up from the character he was in Episode II, it almost feels like he's another character. Hayden's modified acting makes Anakin a protagonist you can understand, encourage, and stand with. A weak character, however, was Padme, at times she felt unneeded and filler, even though she should be an essential point in this movie. The antagonist is perfect. He is well-driven, motivated, and is basically a mastermind. The way the movie's tension increases as we progress is incredible, all the way leading up to the final confrontation, which is also a masterpiece.The CGI is also a minor weakness, but doesn't necessarily ruin the viewing. All in all, Revenge of the Sith is one of the top three Star Wars movies, based on its powerful, well established story and characters."
"Nov 12, 2017",4,The best Star Wars prequel.
"Nov 05, 2017",3.5,The best Star Wars film out of the Prequel Trilogy and it's a great leap of improvement from the last two films. You can feel the emotion from the final sword duel between Obi-wan and his former Padawan Anakin on the planet Mustafar. It's a huge improvement and it's film worth watching.
"Nov 05, 2017",5,I want to see Star Wars I have not seen the one when Aniken becomes Vader
"Nov 05, 2017",4,I think this is the film Lucas wanted all of the prequels to be. Emotional. Poignant. Thrilling. So this is the best one in the prequels.
"Nov 02, 2017",4,"Star Wars Episode III Revenge Of The Sith: Dark, sinister, and intellegent. Revenge Of The Sith is a strong and sutuble ending to the prequel trilogy."
"Oct 30, 2017",5,"The Epic Conclusion
	Star Wars is the epic sci-fi franchise that has some of the best and meaningful fight scenes, excellent character development, and groundbreaking special effects that amaze all people. So does Star Wars Revenge of the Sith match the rest of the films? The answer is a resounding, YES!  It also fits very well into the universe and ties up everything while ending the prequel trilogy and finishing the Skywalker story. 
	Ever since the original Star Wars came out, the effects, both computer and practical, have captivated the audiences. And this film is no exception. The world's and environments created seem and look real and are so beautiful; they are so stunning and really just out of this world cool! The blend between practical and cgi really help make the spaceships look real and just plain awesome. But the cgi characters are the best. They all seem very natural and interact with the characters and environments how they should. The cgi characters also have some big moments in the movie and it feels completely natural just like with a real person.
	Something that depends on special effects but also very important on its own is the fights. All the battles in this movie are visually stunning; but they also carry meaning. There are two big impactful moments in this movie that carry a lot of weight, and are more than just a fight. The first one is the Order 66 montage where all of jedi from all over the galaxy are being wiped out but their own troops. It shows that there is a gigantic threat emerging and that the galaxy will be changed forever. It was also the time when it showed Star Wars was changing and becoming more mature. The next battle that was probably the most impactful and gut wrenching, is the final battle between Obi Wan and Anakin. It was fun and entertaining to watch. The choreography was unique and unlike anything else and was completely created by the two actors who play the characters. 
	But the one thing that makes or breaks the movie in my opinion and that is the characters. If the characters you follow are not relatable or your not attached to them, the movie has no emotional weight to it; so luckily in this movie, the characters are top notch. The two main characters Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi have a great relationship in this movie. It is very heartbreaking to see these best friends end up fighting and hating each other at the end of the movie. Anakin goes through a tremendous journey in the film, having to decide whether he should save his wife from death or let her go. That journey and how it ends really shows how Anakin is an amazing character to follow though in this movie. While on the other hand you have Obi Wan who is a very by the books character who does his job and tries to protect Anakin the best he can. But ultimately both of their goals change by the end of the movie that is truly spectacular."
"Oct 27, 2017",4,"(78/100)
This movie finally hits the right notes and brings the story to a full and good close."
"Oct 20, 2017",4.5,"Best of the prequels. Good movie. This is almost as good a finale as the first two movies could have had, as they sort of set the trilogy up for disaster."
"Oct 11, 2017",5,my favourite out of the prequel so much fights and action that's what I expect from a star wars movie
"Oct 11, 2017",4.5,"Wished the outcome was the same with the first two. This film was better than the Fifth episode in my opinion. It was just that good, I would love to watch it again."
"Oct 08, 2017",5,a master piece the epic conclusion to the prequels. the best action scenes in all the star wars films to date. 
"Oct 08, 2017",2.5,Definitely the best of the prequels and my favorite after Empire and Force. Hayden Christianson?s trainwreck of a performance as Anakin holds it back from greatness.
"Oct 07, 2017",3.5,Not so bad. The prequels had problems but they aren't bad. This films intro proves that.
"Oct 07, 2017",5,A new Star Wars from a past story for the next generation. Now nearly 20 years later we have a new trilogy for the NEXT generation. Star Wars all.
"Oct 05, 2017",4,"Really good movie, interesting plot and awesome lightsaber fights and special effects."
"Oct 02, 2017",2,"I just rewatched Revenge of the Sith last night. And I gotta tell you: I can't recall the last time I got a headache from watching a movie. I'm going to put it mildly. 
1. Horrendous writing: Anakin is so poorly written that I'm baffled people say he's a good character. Palpatine's kidnapping plot makes no sense! Anakin's turn to the dark side is way too quick! The public buying Palpatine saying the Jedi are evil is just head banging! The fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is horribly realized.  
2. Horrible dialogue: Do I even need to say anything? Every line is just a little bit of cringe up my spine.
3. Characters feel like filler: the whole time the characters feel like they have nothing to do or do something that contributes absolutely nothing. Obi-Wan fights Grievous. Why? To end The Clone Wars. Does that contribute anything to Anakin's turn? Nope. Padme is pregnant. Anything else? Nope! 
4. I was constantly asking questions about character decisions. They made about as much sense as casting MATTHEW BRODERICK AS INSPECTOR GADGET!!!!!!!!!! I mean I actually got a headache from how the idiocy of the characters' decisions. 
5. Too much crappy CGI! I mean crappy. I swear every shot looked it came out of the Clone Wars show. It's AWFUL!!
6. They make lightsabers mean nothing! Crap! I remember when lightsabers were such a cool thing in the OT and now it's like I'm watching a bucket of paint! Great job movie. Lightsabers are now a bucket of paint to me!
7. The acting from pretty much everyone is awful! (except Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, and Christopher Lee ( who's only in the movie for 3 minutes tops)) Hayden Christiansen had no idea what material he was given. Natalie Portman felt like she was phoning it in. Sam Jackson is wasted! Even Frank Oz as Yoda felt out of place. Not that I blame them. (I blame the direction they were given. Looking at you, Mr. Lucas.)
8. It feels like there's a great movie in there but it gets so bogged down by everything else that the emotional weight never feels realized on screen.

Man oh man. I didn't realize until last night how truly bad of a film Revenge of the Sith was. The characters' decisions are frustratingly stupid. The characters themselves are either bland or have no purpose (with the exception of Palpatine). The writing is all over the place with tons of filler nobody ever needed! The CGI is overused and atrocious. The cinematography is great at some points but horrible at other points. The editing is pretty good. I do like how Padme's pregnancy and Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader is intercut together. So that's something. The fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is so long I wanted to fall asleep. Don't even get me started on the betrayals to the original trilogy. My goodness!!! People defend this movie and after watching it again, it is a truly awful movie. I can't believe that this is the prequel fanboys defend. It's baffling to me. If you love the movie, please watch it again. I'm serious. You cannot defend a movie this poor! THIS POOR!!!! The only good outcome is that it makes me give me more respect for the original trilogy and appreciate that we have Star Wars material like The Force Awakens, The Clone Wars show, etc. to cover for the huge steaming pile of dog crap that is Revenge of the Sith and the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy. After all the pressuring of watching Revenge of the Sith again just made me hate it!

In the end, this movie was painful. I'm truly baffled that this is the film people will defend. This is nothing but dog crap that deserves a 1.75/5. Oh by the way after watching this ""film"", my rankings for the prequels now go like this:
1. The Phantom Menace (2/5)
2. Revenge of the Sith (1.75/5
3. Attack of the clones (0/5)
Yep. That's right. I actually like The Phantom Menace a bit more because while Revenge of the Sith has more potential for a good story, I think the filmmaking in The Phantom Menace makes episode 3 look like a joke. It feels like they were actually trying to make a good movie, but Lucas just had too many yes men. The CGI, while dated now, for its time looked pretty good. It looks bad now, but at least it doesn't feel like a cartoon. Also it's a film so bad I'll go to sleep. So at least I'll get a good night's rest. Revenge of the Sith is a film so bad I'll get a headache. Man ""Revenge of the Sith is the watchable prequel"". About as watchable as a person kicking you in the private area 2500 times with a steel boot. Ugh. I don't want to think about this movie anymore. It's just horrible. Absolutely horrendous. Ugh!"
"Oct 01, 2017",4.5,light saber fights good!
"Sep 28, 2017",4,Definitely my favorite of the prequel trilogy.  Many negative reviews coming from adults who were looking for the same experience they had when they were children.  Acting was a bit forced but has all the thrills and excitement I was looking for in a Star Wars movie.
"Sep 21, 2017",4,"Revenge of the Sith is the best movie in the three Star Wars prequel movies! With a scary and great story, it gives a perfect ending to the prequels to move on to the story of the original trilogy!"
"Sep 21, 2017",3.5,Not too bad at all!!!
"Sep 12, 2017",3,It's not bad. It has some good themes. It's too bad that it wasn't as well executed as it could have been.
"Sep 09, 2017",5,One of my absolute faves!
"Sep 05, 2017",2,"After the abominable Episodes I &amp; II Lucas finally manages to create a bearable, slightly interesting prequel even though I can't get past the terrible CGI, the awful acting, the pathetic attempts at witty dialogue, the obvious-since-the-previous-film twist that no character has seen coming or that the same man who created the 1977 classic hereby delivers one inartistic, crude, boring action scene after the other expecting that the spectacle of mass CGI destruction should somehow be of interest."
"Sep 05, 2017",3.5,"George Lucas redeems himself and makes an important conclusion of both prequels. This is the darkest and depressing Star Wars series of all the trilogy. All the actors and actresses have a very phenomenal performance in this series. A balancing and improvement from The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are highly emotional, sadness, tragic story, along with its each of emotional characters. Some of the scripts are still the same as the prequel make this film as if exactly with its prequel. However, this is one that you most cherish and has an important effect on the original story. John Williams' score as always has its own passionate level included in this movie."
"Sep 05, 2017",5,Best star wars movie
"Sep 02, 2017",5,I'm a big fan of Star Wars and if you are as well check it out my favorite battle was Aniken vs Obie wan
"Sep 01, 2017",3,i love how anikan drags on the movie at the end when he says no
"Sep 01, 2017",5,"Fantastic improvement on the other prequel films. Filled with emotion, action, and great story telling this film certainly gets closer to the greatness of the originals than any other non-original trilogy Star Wars film does."
"Aug 25, 2017",4.5,Best Prequel and even manages to surpass Return of the Jedi
"Aug 23, 2017",3.5,"A big improvement but has to pay for the sins of Episodes 1 and 2 and some of the acting is still pretty ropey.
3.5/5."
"Aug 22, 2017",4.5,"Completely underrated. This movie pretty much started everything we know about Star Wars and was executed very well, despite a few cheesy romance lines. The action scenes are the best of the franchise up to date, and the movie itself makes you feel emotional after growing so attached to these prequel characters. By far my favorite Star Wars film."
"Aug 19, 2017",4.5,At least Hayden was good this time and the CGI was better
"Aug 19, 2017",1,"The best starwars prequel...


By default."
"Aug 19, 2017",5,Star Wars never fails to impress.
"Aug 15, 2017",4.5,"I really like this movie a lot. It is not the best ""Star Wars"" movie but it does feel like Lucas brought the series back to its roots with this film. The action, the pacing, the emotion, and almost every aspect is certainly better than the other prequels and that is why it is still my favorite ""Star Wars"" prequel to this day and the most underrated film in the series. 
 For more of my review of ""Revenge of the Sith"" and movie news check out my blog at mtmovieblog.wixsite.com/mtmovieblog! It will be greatly appreciated!"
"Aug 14, 2017",3,"The best of the Star Wars prequels, Revenge of the Sith is a movie that is good, not great. The action and brute is something to note though."
"Aug 11, 2017",2,"""Revenge of the Sith"" might have many problems (some that most of the people don't care about), but it has some moments and character acrs conclusions that made this one the best of the prequels trilogy. It might not be a good movie, but at least it refreshes the Star Wars audience from the two last bad movies. With a good Anakin arc and a good ending that was able to conclude all the sub-plots, the prequel ended just right."
"Aug 10, 2017",2.5,"Um it's ok... 

It's just really sad because story wise this should of been the best film of all the prequels, but the script and CGI just ruin it. The Vader scene at the end is still pretty cool if you listen to it on mute without the cringeworthy ""NOOOOOO"" haunting your dreams. 

For our take on how savage it is to kill younglings, head on over to broforcesquad.com"
"Aug 03, 2017",4,"Alright guys, say all whatever you want, but I LOVE EPISODE 3!!! I mean, THANK GOD LUCAS FOR REVIVING THE GREATNESS OF STAR WARS!!! Even though I have to admit Anakin's fall to the dark side was forced and Grievous as wasn't really a great character here unlike in the 2003 Clone Wars, I still love Episode 3 with my true place of my heart."
"Jul 30, 2017",4,"Finally, a prequel that was exciting to watch from the very beginning. Perhaps the darkest Star Wars movie in its franchise, Revenge of the Sith focuses on the turning of Anakin into Darth Vader and it is very exciting to watch. Epic action sequences and the amazing final battles between Anakin and Obi-Wan and Yoda and Darth Sidious are like nothing you have ever seen. In the end, Revenge of the Sith is a must watch Star Wars prequel (you can forget the others.) It is emotionally intense and leads into what is known as the greatest trilogy in movie history."
"Jul 26, 2017",5,"Better than Return of The Jedi, objectively. In my opinion, the best film of the saga."
"Jul 20, 2017",3.5,The best one of the prequels
"Jul 18, 2017",5,"""I JUST LOVE HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN I THOUGHT HE WAS A VERY GOOD ACTOR"""
"Jul 17, 2017",5,For as much crap the prequels get (i think are a tad unwarranted at times) Episode 3 is my all time favorite star wars movie. The story line is a rush from beginning to end and really gets you involved.
"Jul 16, 2017",5,"Even toe the dialogue sometimes is a bit bad, the power of each scene is amazing. Is a tragic movie, one of the few movies where the 2 sides lose. Of course, Anakin needs to fall, but the way they need it... is amazing. The scene where Anakin and Padme are alone and they both cry is by far the best scene in any Star Wars movie ( I'm not counting the Action scenes). If it was released in the 80s, Revenge of The Sith would be seen as one of the best Dark movies of all time."
"Jul 12, 2017",4,More of a love story
"Jul 11, 2017",3.5,"This is a good one to watch. However, i can't say it is amazing compared to the previous ones"
"Jul 08, 2017",3,"The best of the prequels by a long shot. Lucas could have done a better job even with this one had he had someone to tell him no (instead of surrounding himself with ""yes"" men). It's the only prequel I can still watch."
"Jul 06, 2017",3.5,"7/10  RotS is a bit uneven and still suffers from some of the bad writing, acting, and direction, but overall, it has a much more compelling story, with some pretty epic moments (Anakin vs. Obi-Wan, etc.), as well as the ever-charismatic Ewan McGregor. Also, General Grievous has four lightsabers. And that's awesome."
"Jul 05, 2017",5,One of my favorite movie of the whole trilogy.
"Jul 05, 2017",4,Ok nice comeback...props
"Jul 05, 2017",5,"Not only the best of the prequel trilogy, but from my perspective, it's my favorite out of all the seven Star Wars made as of right now."
"Jul 04, 2017",5,Action everywhere they killed like 5 villains in one film it was just brutal
"Jul 03, 2017",4,This movie was great and to see the fall of the republic was amazing. Especially the climatic fight between anakin and obi wan.
"Jul 01, 2017",3.5,On the fence for me but still great
"Jun 30, 2017",5,My favorite Star Wats movie
"Jun 26, 2017",3.5,"Much better than previous two films, and brings good closure to prequel trilogy, but writing is still not as good as it could be."
"Jun 25, 2017",4,"De las mejores de la saga... El comienzo del imperio, el origen de Darth Vader, razones para todo y por montones conectan muchos cabos sueltos. La música es épica. Lástima la actuación de Hayden...Todas las muertes fueron muy oscuras :("
"Jun 25, 2017",4,"Using the PG-13 rating to its advantage, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars prequel to date...unless you include Rogue One. It's still occasionally uneven and still can't match up to the cultural phenomenon that was the original trilogy but it still manages to remain dark, action-packed and visually dazzling. The visual effects look amazing here, some of the best effects in the entire Star Wars franchise, not that the ones in The Force Awakens are bad or anything. As I said earlier, the film is darker as it deals with a good man who becomes corrupted by the dark side thanks to a prophetic vision/dream. George Lucas does a good job of explaining how Vader came to be with the execution providing a suitable explanation for a certain plot twist in The Empire Strikes Back. In this film, Anakin finally grows up following all those tantrums Hayden Christensen threw back in Attack of the Clones. The action sequences are engaging, it feels poignant and yet, although I knew what was going to happen as the fact that this is a prequel would suggest, I still hoped that the good guys would win. To provide a summarized version of this review, Revenge of the Sith provides a dark, poignant, visually dazzling, action-packed and surprisingly satisfying conclusion to the prequel trilogy."
"Jun 20, 2017",3,"Predictable to a fault, not to mention devoid of any true storytelling innovations, Revenge of the Sith caps off the prequel trilogy surprisingly well all things considered, making good use of its darker tone and magnified intensity."
"Jun 20, 2017",4,"It's the best of Episode I,II and III so I liked it"
"Jun 19, 2017",5,Favorite Star Wars film
"Jun 17, 2017",4,"Not a snooze fest like the first two. It was dark, the plot was good. It's a great predecessor to one of the greatest trilogies of all time."
"Jun 17, 2017",4,This movie was much better than the first two.
"Jun 15, 2017",3.5,good movie..thank God whiny hayden chris. is done.
"Jun 14, 2017",5,"RotS is a mixed bag.  It definitely compiles what made Episodes 1 &amp; 2 great into itself, but that unfortunately includes everything that made them bad as well.  RotS did not show case a very good transition for Anakin to becoming Vader, it is definitely one of the worst points in the film as structurally it made absolutely no sense still.  Some of this was thankfully addressed in the fantastic Clone Wars TV Series, but at this point all you had to go on was his character from AotC and the first half of RotS.  The dialogue in this film is better than E2, but not by much.  Natalie Portman is wasted in this movie and completely thrown in as a side note.  Ewan McGregor continues to show that he is holding the series on his shoulders in terms of quality acting with the lack of good direction any of them are being given.
The duel between Anakin and Obi is great, but quickly fizzles out when they start swinging around above lava like tarzan.  The Yoda/Palpatine fight is pointless and not very entertaining as Yoda continues to just hop around like a frog, which I don't think anyone was wanting as a fighting choice for the character.
In the end, I think the PT would have been served Lucas better if it were just a CGI cartoon, as I'm pretty sure that's all he was trying to do with the Trilogy had he been given the ability."
"Jun 13, 2017",4,Liked the movie.better than the first two
"Jun 13, 2017",3,Decent action and interesting character motives. Poor acting and plot progression. Also lacks sadness for its concept. Still the best prequel movie.
"Jun 12, 2017",4,"Better story and visuals. More emotional then the previous two films.

7.5/10"
"Jun 11, 2017",5,"A film with an imaginative, fun, and tragic story that fulfills the original old Star Wars trilogy premise."
"Jun 10, 2017",3.5,Darth Vader is back! :)
"Jun 07, 2017",4,"One of the best aspects of Revenge of the Sith is how it handles the dark turn of Anakin Skywalker. In the films prior to this one, we get some glimpses of what is to become of Anakin. I'm really glad the decision was made to have a much darker Star Wars film. There's a lot of death and really emotional moments. This was the grand finale this trilogy needed. And it worked. The action sequences that appear throughout the movie are amazing. When you look at the action scenes in the other Prequel movies, save for the final duel with Darth Maul at the end of Phantom Menace, there's a common denominator. They're only made to set something up, or to give the viewer some eye candy. The action sequences in Revenge of the Sith are very relevant to the story, and while there's no doubt that the climax between Obi-Wan and Anakin was made to impress, at least it played a big role in the conclusion of the trilogy. Revenge of the Sith is, without a doubt, the best of the three Prequel films."
"Jun 03, 2017",3.5,"If you take out a few scenes, this could be an amazing Star Wars movie."
"Jun 02, 2017",1,"Not as bad as the other prequels, but that's really not saying much. At the very least, there is that one scene with the emperor and Anakin."
"Jun 01, 2017",3,The spectacle and grandeur of this entry largely help cover over some iffy acting and atone for the weakness of the previous two.
"May 27, 2017",1,You can't really be disappointed. What were you expecting? A good prequel movie?
"May 22, 2017",2,Easily the best of the prequel trilogy but that's not saying much. 'Revenge of the Sith' feels like two movies worth of story crammed into one. Anakin's full transformation to the dark side would've been more convincing if there was more build-up. George Lucas really screwed up the storytelling in this trilogy and ultimately the tale of Anakin Skywalker's journey from Jedi Knight to Sith Lord feels unnecessary in relation to the larger Star Wars saga.
"May 21, 2017",5,"This is the best star wars movie in my opinion, i really like it, the action, the drama all is amazing."
"May 17, 2017",3,"To me, this was the whole point of the prequels- Anakin Skywalker falls from grace and becomes Darth Vader. Everything leading up to this premise- while entertaining and brilliantly done- is more or less padding because we know how it will end. Consequently this is the episode in the prequel trilogy that 'feels' the most like a Star Wars movie for me. The inclusion of much loved characters like Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3PO feels more like lip service for the older fans. What I personally enjoyed about this one was the Emperor's subtle coaxing of Anakin to the dark side. It was almost Faustian in the way it was played out. This only cemented Anakin's inner conflict which caused an inevitable rift with his friends and loved ones. The isometric lightsaber duels are impressive in all their digital complexity but it is the emotional stuff that gives the film its thrust. When we see the final scene of Darth Vader rising from the operating table a la Frankenstein's monster, it feels like the emphatic moment in the third act that finally gives us logical continuity."
"May 15, 2017",3,"Look, it's not a bad movie, but it's not good. It has some awesome stuff like Anakin vs Obi Wan, and Vader. But it's so overrated, that some die-hard fans still think it's the best one, when it's clearly not even close to ROTJ..."
"May 15, 2017",4,"Improving over the first two disappointments in the original trilogy, Episode III actually does a pretty good job of linking the bridge between the original trilogy and the CGI-overstuffed messes trilogy. It's not a terrible movie, and the script is much better written and has some genuine intrigue to the reasoning behind the political elements in the film. It's a good film, and outstanding by the standards that the first two set of this ""New Trilogy."""
"May 12, 2017",5,Absolutely love this movie...but I am a huge Star Wars fan...Great lightsaber action in this film.
"May 08, 2017",3,Never as good as the original three but still good
"May 08, 2017",4,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith is the third film from the Star Wars Prequels. Again the acting is good, the story is really good, and darker than the others. The CGI is better, and most things to the film is a little more better than the previous Star Wars Prequels."
"May 05, 2017",3,"Take the plot of Revenge of the Sith, extend it into three movies, and you have the prequel trilogy we all wanted."
"May 04, 2017",3.5,"The Star Wars prequels get a lot of hate. Much of it warranted and much of it exaggerated. Many group them all together and and say they're bad films. I tend to disagree with that notion. While the first two prequels are definitely underwhelming ""Revenge of the Sith"" is the exception. This film is where George Lucas caught his stride in regards to telling the story of Darth Vader. The film plays like a Greek tragedy and is an excellent contrast to what we've come to expect from Star Wars. Instead of seeing a hero rise, we're watching one fall. And the reasons for his fall are well explored. Anakin is at a crossroads in his career and life. The Jedi council won't acknowledge his achievements, his wife is pregnant, and the devil himself is whispering in his ear. Anakin begins to see the dogmatic and arrogance of the Jedi and becomes frustrated with both himself and the council. He ends up taking matters into his own hands and goes down a dark path to save the ones he loves. The emotional weight of the film could have been much heavier had the past two been better written. It is still impressive though how Lucas crafted this story after such a rocky start. The film is once again enhanced by an emotionally gripping score by John Williams, and contains some of the best visuals seen in the series. Many of which still hold up very well. Revenge of the Sith showcases just how much of a visual story teller George Lucas is. Overall, Sith is better acted, better written, and more engaging than the previous two entries in the Saga. The prequel trilogy ends on a high note."
"May 04, 2017",4.5,Revenge of the Sith is flawed with eventual bad dialogue but Anakin's fall to the Dark Side is sad and the final battle is amazing.
"May 03, 2017",3,"Well l just get use to it, and many request those George Lucas come back next final Prequels it Revenge of the sith. many viewer think must least best star wars episodes. The hand George put all after attempt Point less Phamtom Menace and Attack of the Clones were Hyde up Box office Hit. then for a l don't saw the movie after it came out l saw candy it label sell product with tagline promotional camo. l not haven't big shock look the mean [ Guy wear Gas mask] 
something it stupid everyone believe it total let up can all spontaneous movie l don't Episode III Better l Done comment below thank you."
"May 03, 2017",3.5,The best out of the prequels by far. Tied it together pretty well.
"May 01, 2017",2.5,"Aunque sin duda la mejor de la trilogía por muchos de sus elementos dramáticos y cinematográficos...lo cierto es que este tercer episodio sigue teniendo momentos realmente vergonzosos deudores de la anterior entrega. Sí, todos en los que salen Anakin y Padme.....arggg...horrible...

Ah sí, no olvidemos la muerte de Mace Windu....

En fin..."
"Apr 30, 2017",5,If only sand could help us
"Apr 23, 2017",3.5,"GOOD, JUST GOOD

Gosh This Isn't Another Shitty Movie Just Like The Other 2 Prequel Movies

Great Visuals, Good Action Sequences And Forgettable Performance  It Makes Episode III A Good Star Wars Movie But Not Great"
"Apr 22, 2017",5,"Perhaps the most complex Star Wars movie since 'Empire Strikes Back', 'Revenge of the Sith' triumphantly strikes a very delicate balance, since despite  being a sequel to two empty movies with no relevant content, it manages at showing Lucas effort in telling the story we've all been waiting to see on the big screen since episode 1, turning this 'Revenge of the Sith' into a big spectacle full of mesmerizing moments and epic battles."
"Apr 17, 2017",3.5,"Dark, twisted and full of action, Revenge of the sith is the best in the prequel saga, although it still sufers from bad dialogue and horrible performances."
"Apr 09, 2017",2,"Best out of the three prequels. However, very cheesy."
"Apr 09, 2017",3.5,"It's an improvement over the previous two films, but Revenge of the Sith is still poorly written, and Hayden Christensen is still awful. That being said, the action is great and the story is mostly good."
"Apr 09, 2017",2.5,"""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"", while improving upon its predecessor, is not a great film. It gives us considerably more action, respectively, but the performances (apart from McGregor and McDiarmid) are weak and ill-given. The story lacks interesting plot, and up until the end of the movie there wasn't much to keep the audience interested."
"Apr 02, 2017",5,Best Star Wars movie ever.
"Mar 29, 2017",5,Definitely one of my favorite movies in the Star Wars Saga!!
"Mar 24, 2017",4.5,"I keep saying it! R2 is the GOAT! He freaking threw oil at two battle droids and lit them on fire with his boosters. Kickass. You can see how ahead of himself Anakin is but also how much stronger he's become. Dooku is strong as well but much older. Grievous is such a cool concept for a character. So basically Yoda trained Dooku, Dooku trained Obi-Wan and Obi-Wan trained Anakin. 

It's so unfortunate what happens to Anakin and Padme. To everyone! This is by far the darkest of the prequels. It's insane to see how manipulative, sinister and evil Palpatine was. The way he tricks Anakin into believing him. I don't get why Anakin didn't listen to Yoda. Yoda is the wise one! He told Anakin not to fear losing a loved one, for it will be what ruins him. 

It's so crazy seeing Order 66 being executed and seeing all the Jedi's being killed off. Pretty sad and dark, but it weighs on you just how evil Sidious is. It's so cool to see the good relationship Yoda has with the wookies and seeing Chewbacca. 

Episode III has so much going on. This is by far the best of the prequels. The storytelling is great which makes the movie seem like it's going at a steady fast pace. The origin story of how Anakin became Darth Vader. The birth of both Luke and Leia. The epic battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin. Both sad and dark especially towards the end but it ties into the next movie to come."
"Mar 23, 2017",5,"Absolutely loved it worth the watch natalie portman is perfect and hayden and Ewan McGregor are incredible aswell, the cinematography is incredible and I really got the feels watching it and the fact that you know that anakin will turn to the dark side but you still hope he won't + John williams music IS FANTASTIC and so nostalgic"
"Mar 22, 2017",4,Out of the prequels this film is by far the best. Is it perfect? No. But there is still fun to be had. To me Ewan McGregor is the best Obi-Wan to ever grace the screen. He shows the heart of the character and the love he has for his fallen brother. The darkness of this film is something that has not been touched on much in the universe of Star Wars and it is welcomed.
"Mar 21, 2017",5,Brilliant and devastating tale of the fall of the Republic.
"Mar 20, 2017",3,HOW DOES THIS HAVE 79 PERCENT?!
"Mar 20, 2017",3,"The best of the prequel series. But still not better than Empire. The acting is still only mediocre, but it was just better or something."
"Mar 14, 2017",3,"I've seen logs act better than Hayden. But the rest is pretty decent.
Too many annoying Lil droids though."
"Mar 09, 2017",5,Great film it has lots of fight scenes some were rushed
"Mar 06, 2017",4,"Does not get the credit it deserves, unfairly lumped in with the rest of the prequels. Unafraid, thought-provoking, and epic. Represents an inkling of what Star Wars could have been, a political thriller with suspense and actual stakes. So close to being a truly fantastic film but for its missteps in dialogue and pacing. Still. This is what Star Wars could have been. A dark fall from grace, the chosen one turning to the dark side to protect the person he loves. What a fantastic character arc and well handled by this movie. Utimately one of the best of the entire series"
"Mar 05, 2017",5,my all time favorite.
"Mar 04, 2017",3.5,"This is the only one of the Lucas prequels that I can stomach.  I don't hate the movies like everyone else does, I appreciate Lucas' effort to build up the story.  This chapter really made up for Episodes I and II.  I could give this a better rating if it didn't have stupid stuff in it, like buzz droids and Jar Jar Binks."
"Mar 04, 2017",3,"This movie is so much better than 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones', but not as good as 'A New Hope', 'The Empire Strikes back' and 'Return of The Jedi'."
"Mar 02, 2017",3.5,This movie is so great that makes you wish the acting of Christensen was better.
"Feb 21, 2017",2.5,"Finally, a watchable prequel. This movie is much, much better than the last two. However, it still has some of the other movies problems. Some bad acting for example. This movie still overly relies on CGI, however this time the CGI is much better, but that doesn't stop some sets looking fake, or from a cartoon. This movie is also where we get to see Anakin Skywalker turn into Darth Vader, which is handled brilliantly at the end with the purge of the Jedi. A complaint that I have though is that the lightsaber fight between Obi-wan and Anakin is over choreographed to the point where it looks like they're dancing rather than fighting. If you're not a huge star wars fan but you want to watch a prequel than just watch this one."
"Feb 16, 2017",5,This is defiently the best Star Wars movie ever made. I can't belive that the sequel trilogy also had the same battle as episode III.
"Feb 15, 2017",5,"I love every part of this movie. The detail in the CGI is insanely good, the chemistry between the actors is great, and I think the soundtrack for the movie is John Williams's best work. This movie also is great at getting the audience to feel emotional, especially during the Order 66 montage. It also has the best light saber fight in all of Star Wars."
"Feb 15, 2017",2.5,"Although it gives an awesome ending to the prequel trilogy with one of the best lightsaber battles in the franchise, it still doesn't seam to exactly live up to the original trilogy. The dialogue has some unforgettable cheese, especially in Anakin Skywalker's script. I myself am not a fan of Hayden Christensen and do believe Lucas could've found a better actor that specialized in improvising the script. With a young actor like Christensen, he didn't build up enough skill to expand his character to his full potential. But overall, the film is pretty decent, especially compared to the two prequels before it."
"Feb 15, 2017",5,"One of the best Star Wars Movies I have ever seen. Never in my life have I seen any Star Wars movie, especially a prequel, be this good."
"Feb 08, 2017",4,"Star wars revenge of the sith manages to be the best of the prequels, with it's more fleshed out story, great character conflicts, and overall improved film-making. while it does have some questionable moments, it's still very enjoyable."
"Feb 06, 2017",5,"one of the oldest but saddest movie, showing anakins fall to the dark side"
"Feb 04, 2017",4.5,Ewan McGregor. That is all.
"Feb 04, 2017",5,"The story of this episode is, although sad, really beautiful. I strongly recommend this film. They did a good job in telling how and why the young  Anakin became Darth Vader. The movie is able to make you feel empathy for Vader, feel his pain, understand the road he eventually took."
"Feb 04, 2017",4.5,The acting isn't great but it's still the best in the series by far.
"Feb 01, 2017",3,Somewhat better than the previous two episodes but by now I've lost all interest and still finding it hard to maintain my suspension of disbelief with the way over the top action and a whole host of other annoyances.
"Jan 31, 2017",4.5,"Although it is plagued by awful status quo Star Wars prequel dialogue, Revenge of the Sith ultimately tells a very intriguing story of how the fear of loss can drive good people to do terrible things. There are a lot of great moments of emotional tension in this film, as well as some excellent story telling techniques. Although the performances in this film are mostly bland, there are also some very good ones, in particular by Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid. The movie is strongest when it relies on visual story telling that is enhanced by John Williams' fantastic score."
"Jan 24, 2017",2.5,Well...it's not a dumpster fire....so that's something
"Jan 23, 2017",2.5,"This is the best of the prequels, but it is still terrible and over political. Darth Vader is ruined forever."
"Jan 23, 2017",4,Entertaining but too much CGI.
"Jan 22, 2017",5,"This is arguably one of the most under appreciated films of the 21st century(possibly even in cinematic history). The opening sequence gets your attention right away and never lets up. The finale is not only action-packed and visually stunning, but it carries an emotion that is helped greatly by the score done by John Williams, and it sets up the events in Episode IV in a manner that works well, even though it may seem a little flawed. The script is fine, and Anakin and Padme seem to show more chemistry than in the previous installments through their dialogue, in addition to their overall acting. In a scene shortly after things begin to settle into the second act, the couple has a conversation that includes elements that foreshadow future events in the movie, which is done in an ingenious way some may not catch in their first viewing or if they are new to the series. The scene slows the movie down enough to avoid the story flying by too fast also, which helps the pacing problem of the first two in the trilogy be mostly nonexistent throughout the film. In fact, the best elements from this movie overshadow the few problems to be found.Altogether, a dark and exciting conclusion to the Star Wars prequel trilogy."
"Jan 19, 2017",5,"Star Wars: Revenge of The Sith is a great, action packed Star Wars film. I particularly like the darker edge this movie provides, along with the different vibe it offers."
"Jan 14, 2017",3.5,The closest to the magic of the originals but not quite.  Still a very decent movie.  The sheer mythology in the context of the originals is what makes this movie.
"Jan 13, 2017",3.5,"George Lucas's Revenge of The Sith showed us most of what we needed to see, but he added a lot that we did not. Too many awkward moments, and comedy bits, it took away the seriousness of the situation. The acting was ok, some scenes could have used more intensity. One of the things that annoyed me was the light sabers, yes there should be more use of the lightsabers in this chapter, but Obi-Wan turning it on because he was afraid of Anakens jump scare? Shouldn't Obi-Wan have the ability to sense that it was Anakin?? Another scene is when he was riding the giant lizard he had his saber on, WHY? The characters walked instead of running when the situation called for it, and some action scenes were far too long. With some heavy editing I believe Episode 3 can become a great Film!!"
"Jan 11, 2017",4,Nota: 8.3/10 - 4.2/5
"Jan 10, 2017",1.5,NNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!
"Jan 09, 2017",5,A nice improvement from Attack of the Clones. Revenge of the Sith moves away from the lovey-dovey crap and gets into the nitty-gritty of how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader and how the Republic became a galactic superpower.
"Jan 09, 2017",3,it's the best of the prequels but who ever says it's great is crazy
"Jan 07, 2017",5,Here's where Star Wars gets good! This movie is packed with lightsaber duels and they are AWESOME!!! I love this movie!!!
"Jan 02, 2017",4.5,"I do love this movie. Unlike most die hard Star Wars fans, I don't hate the prequels. Yes they lack character development and emotion that were present in the original trilogy. This movie is the redeemer of this trilogy with its faster pace and less time spent with the assembly of senators. Great movie."
"Jan 02, 2017",4,"The final prequel brings the saga together. Of course there's action, but there's much more story and character development going on then there was in the previous two."
"Dec 31, 2016",3.5,While it does have some moments that are as bad as the last two. It at least was telling an easy story to follow and managed to be a solid conclusion to an uneven trilogy.
"Dec 29, 2016",3,"I'm not quite sure where to put this film. Objectively i can't say it's good, but it's certainly not bad. It's a guilty pleasure for me, but it's got problems, but it also fixed a lot of issues that the prequels had. The romance between Anakin and Padem isn't as awkward as it was in AOTC, it has some genuinely touching/nice moments, it's got nice visuals, the acting wasn't as wooden this time around, the dialogue was MUCH better this time around, and it truly feels like it has a cohesive story! The pacing isn't great, but it isn't as bad as the pacing in the previous films was, but all that being said, there are still those moments that make me pull back and say ""Okay, maybe this wasn't so great"". While the dialogue improved overall, there's still some REALLY bad lines of dialogue. The final battle felt like more a spectacle show than an intense/personal confrontation between two Jedi warriors who were once close friends. This battle should've felt more like the battle between Vader and Luke in episode 6, but instead this battle feels more like a laser show. It's not bad, it has its moments, and the dialogue Obi-Wan gives after the battle may just be the best part of the film. But as a film overall, it's decent. I think that's the best word to describe this film: decent. Three stars."
"Dec 28, 2016",3.5,This was probably my favorite of the prequel trilogy. The story is fun to watch unfold and has a large amount of sadness. The acting is pretty good and the fight scenes are fun to watch. I recommend it.
"Dec 27, 2016",5,The best movie from the second trilogy.
"Dec 27, 2016",4,A good conclusion to the Star Wars prequels with thrilling action as George Lucas explores the darker side of the force .
"Dec 27, 2016",3,"Okay. So this one is actually okay. I think. This was my first viewing because growing up episode 1 and 2 burned me out so bad I had written 3 off. And idk it could just seem okay because I watched it directly after the shit shows that are 1 &amp; 2. It's sort of hard to enjoy these with the lack of femme jedi though. Like it hurts to think, ""would I be sith or jedi, wait but they're all men"" and like having to remember the few jedi women who were just fodder. Like damn. Disney didn't buy Star Wars soon enough. Also I hate every robot through episode 1 -  3 except r2d2."
"Dec 24, 2016",5,"Easily the 3rd best of the 7 films, and definitely the best of the prequel trilogy."
"Dec 23, 2016",3.5,"Though it still has some of the flaws from the predecessors, it certainly improves over the predecessors as a thrilling, tragic, and satisfying conclusion to the Star Wars prequel trilogy."
"Dec 23, 2016",5,The best out of all the Star Wars in my opinion
"Dec 20, 2016",4,"Say what you want about Episode 3 but Lucas saw how weak the last 2 were, took metaphoric roids and fixed a lot, but not all his mistakes. The plot and concept were excellent but execution and dialogue was the movies soft spot. Overall, this is the best of the prequel in the saga but still not on the same level of entertainment as the original saga."
"Dec 17, 2016",5,"Really epic, and a surprising way to introducs the original trilogy."
"Dec 17, 2016",5,"Many claim Ewan McGregor is the best actor in these prequels and claim everyone else is wooden but it seems in this film that the opposite is true and he was wooden , so that seems to tell more about the people who have an agenda against the quality of these prequels then the films quality itself."
"Dec 17, 2016",5,"The best prequel, as well as one of the best overall. In my top three best Star Wars movies."
"Dec 17, 2016",3,"Easily the best of the Star Wars prequels. At the same time it's one of the most tragic since George's Lucas' crummy direction ruins the movie's heart and power making it, once again, feel like a machine, albeit, a more enjoyable machine."
"Dec 16, 2016",5,I liked this one because of the fights they were all epic
"Dec 15, 2016",4.5,"The best prequel movie. One of the best Star Wars movies. Better than Empire for me. Even though it can't reach the heights of A New Hope or The Force Awakens, it came pretty damn close."
"Dec 15, 2016",3,Hard to like because of the movies leading up to it but this one has plenty of great moments and memorable lightsaber duels. However it isn't nearly as good as it could have been.
"Dec 14, 2016",2.5,Nooooooooooooooooooo!
"Dec 13, 2016",4,"""I'll have to admit, this epic is a bigger improvement over its first two predecessors because they've got the story right, the visuals are outstanding, the actions were very legit, and the rise of Darth Vader just gives you chills down your spine. This is quite possibly the most darkest 'Star Wars' film ever written in the history of cinema. There are a few things I've found wrong with this film which are some grammar errors, little bit of dialogue, and ""You're breaking my heart."". However, the story of how everything went down just kept my eyes open and it was done so well."""
"Dec 07, 2016",4,"The best of the wholel prequel trilogy!! Still has awkward and bland dialogue at times, but the story, and action far outweigh the negatives this time!! Probably recommend this one over the other prequel films in any way!!"
"Dec 04, 2016",4,This movie was much better than Attack of the Clones!
"Dec 04, 2016",4,"Dark, gritty, and the best action of the entire prequels. Although still plagued by terrible dialogue and acting."
"Nov 29, 2016",3.5,the best of the this trilogy.
"Nov 25, 2016",4,"I love this movie. From the epic, large-scale Clone Wars battles, to the emotional, climactic duel between two old friends, there is a lot to love about this movie. Unfortunately, the acting is what brings this film down. It is, at times, horrendous, on par with the other two prequels. But by no means is this a bad film. I would recommend to anyone."
"Nov 25, 2016",4,"Revenge of the Sith finally captures the scope and adventure worthy of Vader's backstory offering beautiful visuals and exotic locations, a terrific plot twist, and a seamless transition into the original trilogy."
"Nov 24, 2016",4,"Revenge of the Sith improves upon its predecessor not only on the breathtaking battle scenes, but also on the engaging script that finally depicts the ascension of Darth Vader."
"Nov 19, 2016",5,A definite improvement over Episodes I &amp; II.
"Nov 18, 2016",3.5,Fun but has major plot holes.
"Nov 15, 2016",4,"This film saved the prequel trilogy from being TOTAL garbage. The most notable difference in this film is the upgrade in cinematography and action. The editing was smooth and things like lighting and use of various camera angles made this feel like a film worth watching. The most notable action scene for me was the opening space battle. The first part when Anakin &amp; Obi-Wan fly over the Republic Cruiser, and you see the overhead angle of the entire battle, was an awesome shot that immediately made it feel superior to the first two episodes.

The dialogue and acting was also improved. It definitely wasn't perfect, but it had some great moments (i.e. the opera scene w/ Palpatine). This movie was so good I actually consider watching it when deciding which Star Wars film I want to watch. I never consider episodes I &amp; II. Out of all the prequels, it's the only one that properly contributes to the Star Wars story. The first episode is all about pod-racing, the second is about love (which was lame). However, the majority of the scenes in this film actually forward the main plot regarding Anakin's path to becoming Vader. There were some scenes that were unnecessary (mostly with General Grievous), but at least those were entertaining enough to not bore you. However, there was some dialogue in the film that was pretty awkward, most notably when Vader yells ""no"" near the end with some other scenes, but I find that the good scenes and good action in this film totally outweighs the little annoyances of it.

Overall, Revenge of The Sith was a good film. It had some awkward moments, but the good outweighed the bad. If you want to see a GOOD origins story for Vader and the original trilogy, just watch this. Even better, watch the Clone Wars series beforehand."
"Nov 10, 2016",4,The best out of the prequels
"Nov 01, 2016",4.5,"If Hayden Christensen wasn't bad, this movie would've been perfect. Anakin finally turns into Vader, which we've all been waiting for, it's a crap load darker than the past 5 movies. The first to get a PG-13. It's unfortunately underrated because the other prequels were crap. I would recommend this movie on every level."
"Oct 28, 2016",4,"If you can get past the romance dialogue, this film shows the darkness of Star Wars. By far the best of the prequels, Lucas shows us how the Jedi fall and builds to a worthy climax."
"Oct 16, 2016",4,"Great movie, shows how the prequels connect with the originals good."
"Oct 13, 2016",4,Love it! Rvenge of the Sith is the best and last movie of the Star Wars Prequels which was quite enjoying and pretty violent too.
"Oct 06, 2016",5,It was a good movie with a lot of nice scenes.
"Oct 05, 2016",3.5,"A movie with so much going for it, Star Wars Episode III concluded the 'Lucas fiasco' preceding the original trilogy. Unfortunately for viewers, Christianson's portrayal of Aniken Skywalker did not improve from the awkward and unbelievable recitation of the previous film; nor did the chemistry with Portman's character Padmé, worsening the overall performance. Whilst bad acting, unnecessary humour and somewhat shaky plot lines upset many Star Wars fanatics, notable performances from McGregor McDiarmid, Lee and Jackson in conjunction with truly stunning visual effects, breathtaking action sequences and undeniable Star Wars nostalgia boosted the credibility of the film. Regardless of opinions, the film was no utter failure, and gave all the necessary background leading into the originals for viewers to enjoy."
"Sep 22, 2016",5,"Man! Just when you think these guys couldn't get any better! This one to me was the best ever! Shows down to a science how Anniken was manipulated by evil and transformed, fell from grace. Similar to the way the devil preys on the weak, makes them think they're self sufficient, then out of no where tears them down. Stay with Jesus Christ America, we will be strong!"
"Sep 19, 2016",5,The best star wars movie to date (mid 2016). The plot is full of twists and the characters are full of surprises. The soundtrack is intense and all the special effects are amazing. Seeing the fall of the republic and the jedi and the rise of the Galactic Empire is heart breaking but a hell of a journey.
"Sep 08, 2016",5,"Finally, an installment in the prequel trilogy in which I actually loved, and would recognize it as one of the best Star Wars films I got to experience."
"Sep 04, 2016",3.5,"After the pitfalls of its predecessors, Revenge of the Sith had a faithful chance at doing justice to the saga once again as well as to the prequel trilogy and surprisingly enough, for the most part, it does."
"Aug 31, 2016",5,"Great movie! Beautiful visually, and done with a great imagination. Climactic, as it should be, Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christnsen are at their best."
"Aug 30, 2016",4,"As I sit here in the post Disney Star Wars acquisition - reflecting on Lucas' contentious prequels, is even more interesting than ever before. Particularly considering that LucasFilm is LITERALLY about to release the 4th SW sequel this dec, ROUGE ONE. So, where does that leave us with the Original Prequels? Well, for me, I appreciate them even more now, than i did when they were released. This is not to say that I did not like Episode VII- or that I am not excited for R1- because honestly, I love the new Star Wars films...and directions. But I will still defend the prequels to my dying day. YES, Lucas had too much CGI and far too much cartoon, kiddie BS in Episode 1. But each film became more mature, more exciting and Revenge of the Sith not only ended the 2nd trilogy on a high note- it is offically- IMO- the 3rd best Star Wars film, to date. The themes are intense, scenes are haunting and Hayden and Ewan's performances are EXACTLY what I wanted to see in my head when I watch Obi Wan talk to Luke about their relationship in the original film. I love that Jimmy Smits is returning for R1, I love that Ewan had a brief voice over as OWK in episode 7 and YES, I hope that Hayden's ghost DOES return in either 8 or 9. Outside of the orignal 2 chapters, Revenge of the Sith is absolutely my favorite chapter in a series of films that I LOVE. May the Force Be With You....

"Aug 30, 2016",1.5,"It's bad folks. Don't hate Hayden I think he was the perfect casting choice, the problem was the script and the direction.  This movie proves that in 40 years, George Lucas has neither evolved his craft or learned any of the lessons from his previous films.  The menacing Count gets the Bobba fet treatment by dying too soon, shot reverse shot gets old quick, dialogue recycling is annoying, and the pacing is the worst.  Also why do the menacing battle droids sound like whinny babies now? OK Lets briefly touch on what's good: less Jar Jar, less Natalie Portman, the scene at the temple that pays homage to Rosemary's baby, and Ian MacDiarmid who is the best thing in the movie"
"Aug 23, 2016",4.5,"This film not only feels the pay off we've all been waiting for since The Phantom Menace, but it does truly feel like the culmination of the entire Star Wars saga, and that's why I would argue that not only is it the best of the prequels, not only is it a great film, but I think it's the second best film in the franchise behind only Empire Strikes Back. 

It features the two best light saber battles in the entire franchise, the best performances George Lucas could scrounge from Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman, and an overall plot that was much more balanced than the previous two entries. 

I highly recommend this movie as it was a great way to end the franchise."
"Aug 22, 2016",3.5,Not perfect and some what uneven but episode 3 is entertaining and shows us how necessary it is with cool light saber battles and a good enough story that stays in line with the original series
"Aug 21, 2016",3,By far the better of the three new generation Star Wars films. Not only because it brings this cringeworthy new generation attempt to a close but because this episode of the franchise actually provides entertainment. This film actually provides thrill and entertainment with action. A film that almost deserves to be associated with Star Wars. Compared to the previous two films this one deserves to be watched.Its a breath of fresh air in this new generation instalment and deserved to be given the recognition of not totally sucking. Well done George Lucas we got there eventually.
"Aug 20, 2016",3.5,So much better than the previous prequels and really comes out with a great villain and a dark tone. I wish the other prequels were all clone wars era because i enjoyed the clones battling the separatist.
"Aug 20, 2016",4.5,"MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT Over The Last 2 Prequels
Revenge Of the Sith Is a Very Satisfying Finale For the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy"
"Aug 17, 2016",1,Bad end to a bad saga
"Aug 16, 2016",4.5,"I hate prequels. A part of the magic of a film or novel is the not knowing. You're waiting to see what's going to happen next because you just don't know. When you don't have that, watching the movie becomes a normal thing, like driving to a gas station. That being said, when a prequel is pulled off well I have to give credit where credit is due. There has been a lot of talk over the quality of the Star Wars prequels and what exactly George Lucas was thinking. With Star Wars: Episode III--Revenge of the Sith, I think he got it right.

Space operas can be confusing as there are things happening we might not fully understand. There is a huge political shake-up here that might be hard to keep up with and my suggestion is to not even try. The action is more than enough to keep you entertained. While the first two prequels try and keep the story moving with dialogue and character development, Revenge of the Sith has way more slicing and dicing. Let's face it, we love Star Wars largely because of the lightsaber battles and this film doesn't disappoint. Where the second prequel came up very short with a brief Yoda battle, Revenge of the Sith gives our favorite little green hero multiple action sequences that will leave you with a cheesy grin on your face.

The Star Wars series has never struggled in the area of visuals and Revenge of the Sith is no exception. There's so much attention to detail that it's almost silly, from the hundreds of crazy cool creatures to the impact a lightsaber has with other objects. Two particular scenes that stick out in my head are Obi Wan's race through a cavernous set-piece on a dinosaur with a high pitched yelp and Obi Wan's battle with Anakin Skywalker as lava is exploding all around them. Eye candy galore.

Outside of the action, Revenge of the Sith did something else quite well that failed to resonate in the first two prequels: create an emotional tie. This is a dark movie that definitely earns it's PG-13 merit badge. The sadness is almost palpable as you watch a great force of good being extinguished. Anakin leaves behind a trail of destruction that you can't unsee which left me thinking, ""Man, they really went there. Wow.""

Two small cons I must address: 1. Hayden Christensen, while much improved from Attack of the Clones, still leaves a lot to be desired as an actor. It's almost like the director did multiple takes of his scenes and decided to go with the ones that sucked the least. 2. Jar Jar. Oh, Mr. Binks, your lack of relevance in everything you have to do with these prequels will never cease to amaze me. I will say, these two blemishes pale in comparison to everything else the movie does well.

It's the story of a troubled kid becoming one of the most iconic bad guys the universe has ever seen. A great swan song to the prequel trilogy, I give this movie a 97."
"Aug 15, 2016",5,The best Star Wars movie ever
"Aug 13, 2016",5,"Unlike the other prequels, I do actually think this is a good movie. There are some plot holes created and inconsistencies in regards to what was set up in the original movies, but whatever. that's to be expected. Unlike the flat and boring scenes of the previous movies, there are actually a number of effective scenes that are great because of things other than the visuals and action. Like the scene where Anakin and padme are simply staring out the window at the same time in diffeent places. That was a great scene imo. order 66 was also very effective. beyond those, there is so much cool shit happening in this movie that unless you're a stick in the mud it's impossible not to be entertained. "
"Aug 09, 2016",3,The best of the prequels. Need I say more?
"Aug 08, 2016",4,"George Lucas again has made another fascinating and fantastic sequel, though the movie has many unnecessary plot twists itself."
"Aug 07, 2016",4,"Episode 3 is the last of the prequel trilogy and by far the best one. The special effects are great, but what makes this movie special is the familiarity of the characters and the real feeling of good versus evil. There is not many movies where only a handful of people survive and the villains hold up the victory flag. For those of you that are just now getting into the Star Wars universe, I recommend watching episode 3. George Lucas was truly ahead of his time with this timeless classic."
"Aug 07, 2016",4,This film has its problems but the excellent score by John Williams mixed together with the visually impressive set pieces tell a great tale of how Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader.
"Aug 07, 2016",5,it is a great film. A awesome story that showed Anakin becoming Darth Vader.
"Aug 05, 2016",3.5,"The Star Wars prequel trilogy may not be the best films in the world the final film does deliver a good Star Wars film with some great action, CGI and a fulfilling end to the trilogy that leads into the original films. The films action is good and fast paced with good CGI added into the mix but despite this the films story as a few plot holes which don't work in the overall story of the Star Wars saga. The acting is the worst part with only Ewan mcgregor giving a good performance. On the hole the film is a fun and exciting end to a not so fun and exciting trilogy."
"Aug 04, 2016",5,Best movie of the prequels
"Aug 04, 2016",5,Dark and demented sci fi action adventure! Spectacular visual effects and a great performance from Ewan McGregor.
"Aug 04, 2016",3,"While it may still suffer from major problems, this film finally got close to feeling like a good Star Wars film. The darker ambiance is greatly appreciated, the visuals are still just as impressive, the action sequences are great, and the building up just makes it feel much more grander than it really is. However in regards to the film's problems, they are separated into two majors aspects. The first being the story: while it is much more intriguing than before, it still does suffer from feeling rushed. It fails to take its time in presenting itself and ends up with occasional fantastic moments, but mostly average moments too. The second problematic aspect is the characters: one again, the two main focused actors aren't that good (they're improved in comparison to ""Attack of the Clones"", but still not that good), but on the other hand the rest of cast is still excellent. Much better than its two predecessors, and while still suffering from similar problems, this film surprisingly gets the closest its ever gotten to a good Star Wars film side the original trilogy. I'd recommend it, just lower your expectations a tad."
"Aug 03, 2016",5,"It,s a good Star Wars film and a good set up for Star Wars episode 4 a new hope"
"Jul 28, 2016",2.5,"George Lucas's ultimate vision finally concludes with a fairly satisfactory film compared to the two previous prequels. This movie is on par with Return of the Jedi in my opinion. The lightsaber battles we always wanted, Yoda vs. Palpatine and Anakin vs. Obi Wan are both very thrilling and almost make up for George Lucas' lackluster directorial skills and his actors struggling to deliver some of the worst lines ever written in film history."
"Jul 25, 2016",3.5,Though it still suffers from the same problems the other prequels have had this watchable Star Wars prequel brings better and renewed concepts of what the other prequels tried to be
"Jul 23, 2016",3,"A big improvement from the last two, The Revenge Of The Sith is still kind of uneven, but a lot more entertaining with some of the best action in the whole franchise."
"Jul 23, 2016",3,"Revenge of the Sith relies too deeply on deriving from its' predecessor films in order to make up for the absence of its' own original storyline, yet this feels positively different from the other prequels. Unlike the unbearably unwatchable Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, at least here, it was pleasant to watch the ironic twist that the chosen one Anakin fell into hatred and therefore this is how he became the absolute unreasonably devious villain in the (far superior) original 2 Star Wars episodes. Revenge of the Sith may not have gotten so hated if this were the only prequel made."
"Jul 21, 2016",5,Star Wars episode 3 was very good with them starting in to reveal the secrets behind the characters known as Anakin Skywalker as Darth Vader that was very shocking when he turned to the dark side Chancellor Palpatine reveals himself known as the emperor Darth Sidious what is shocker right there but good reviews for episode 3 very good to reveal the secrets of the backstory of our favorite characters.   Star Wars  the beginning The Phantom Menace.
"Jul 20, 2016",5,"The best Star Wars movie in my opinion has loads of well coreographed action scenes between anakin and obi wan, mace windu and darth sidious as well as three others the scenery is great and the story is exceptional"
"Jul 20, 2016",5,the best prequel of the new trilogy
"Jul 19, 2016",3,"A big improvement over the first 2 films in the trilogy has a better story ,dialogue and action but still has many rushed scenes and hayden christensen sucks in these movies."
"Jul 18, 2016",5,My favorite Star Wars movie!
"Jul 17, 2016",5,The only thing that's not amazing about this movie are certain actors and dialogue.
"Jul 15, 2016",3.5,By far the best movie of the prequel trilogy. Story is ok. Hayden Christensen needs work as does his relationship with Padmé. Special effects are good but they need go  insert some practical effects in. (NO more Special editions tho!)
"Jul 11, 2016",4,"Aside from the dialogue being clumsy and the plot holes, this movie is very enjoyable and has so much eye candy that the flaws can often be forgiven. I feel Hayden especially really shined in this one, more so because I felt his acting in Attack of the Clones was very clumsy and bereft of emotion, but it's refreshing in this movie, especially after (spoilers, but shame on you if you haven't already seen this movie, lmao) he joins the Dark side and much of his acting consists of facial expressions. The ending scene with him and Obi-Wan just gets me every time. General Grievous is also a great villain, he was portrayed amazingly in this film, I don't care what anyone says. Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine) is also amazing, so engaged and energetic and is obviously having the time of his life in this role. Overall, yes the movie has its flaws, but given the fact that after all these years, it is what it is. I would say it's definitely my favourite out of the prequel trilogy."
"Jul 11, 2016",0.5,"You're best off watching the Mr. Plinkett Review. It will explain the plot and characters better than the movie did:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYWAHuFbLoc"
"Jul 09, 2016",5,"Best of prequels 
lots and lots of action 
Wished only for more action in Yoda sidious scene"
"Jul 09, 2016",4,"Revenge of the Sith concludes the prequel trilogy on a good note. Anakin's character is actually good in this film, he finally begins his descent to the dark side. This is definitely the darkest of the prequels. The addition of more suspense, tension, and action that replaces exposition makes this film differ from the first two prequels. There are still moments with bad dialogue, but Revenge of the Sith still is a much better film than the previous two installments."
"Jul 09, 2016",3.5,Revenge of the Sith is a decent conclusion to the Star Wars prequel trilogy. It ties the prequel trilogy with the original trilogy. Revenge of the Sith is good in my book.
"Jun 30, 2016",4.5,Darker than what you would think. And a great movie.
"Jun 28, 2016",4,"overal good movie, best in the lackluster prequel trilogy, yet anything they were beginning to do well (battle of the heroes, order 66) was all thrown in the toilet when we heard the infamous ""NROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"""
"Jun 21, 2016",2.5,"While the strongest of the Star Wars prequels, Revenge of the Sith ultimately falters with a dull script and mawkish acting."
"Jun 20, 2016",4,Pelicula muyyyy infravalorada.
"Jun 17, 2016",3.5,A good movie with some pacing issues and some bad effects
"Jun 15, 2016",3.5,"This film is the best Star Wars prequel, which really isn't saying much. It still has those ""sitting &amp; talking stuff"" and plot contradictions to the original trilogy.

1. How did Leia remember her mom's face? (Episode VI)
2. Why didn't Obi-Wan remember Leia? (Episode V)

It's no wonder that the prequel trilogy still ruins the continuity &amp; reputation of the original one."
"Jun 14, 2016",5,An excellent way to end a rather sub-par trilogy.
"Jun 11, 2016",5,"The perfect Star Wars movie,its better than all of the movies of the franchise(my opinion),The other movies of this trilogy failed to be ""Star Wars"",and I think that this movie is the Best movie of the franchise !"
"Jun 08, 2016",5,"My favorite movie  of all time. This is the one movie, I could watch endlessly. When I was 3 years old I remember acting out the scene with my brother. :)"
"Jun 08, 2016",4,"Finally a prequel worth watching. Passion was put into this film. From the screenplay to the acting performances, Revenge of the Sith delivered excellence."
"Jun 07, 2016",3,"Among the prequels it's the best, but still movie has it own problems. it's almost ruins Darth Vader's Story!!!"
"Jun 05, 2016",3,Very dull acting. Completely choreographed fights. Almost everything in the movie is cgi. But there was less jar jar and a little better acting compared to attack of the clones. I give Star Wars Revenge Of The Sith a B-
"Jun 04, 2016",5,"2 best episode after empire. This Star Wars installment has it all. From the first battle scene to the betrayal of the Jedi to the final closing scene. Great film. To boost it has one of John Williams best soundtrack. 

Some critics may not like it out an impulse reaction to hate all things prequel. But this movie has everything we like about Star Wars. Space battles. Multiple light saber duels and a great story lines that shows how our hero did and why he fell from grace. 

A must see for any true Star Wars fan."
"Jun 02, 2016",3.5,"While it is not as good as the first 2,it's still a mostly solid movie"
"May 29, 2016",3.5,3 stars just for the light sabers.
"May 24, 2016",2,Ok this was ok still not good but ok.
"May 23, 2016",5,Best prequel movie by far
"May 22, 2016",3.5,"Though a bit unsteady, Revenge of the Sith was still fun and emotional and a big improvement to the Star Wars prequels."
"May 21, 2016",4,"George Lucas hadn't done a very good job on Star Wars in the six years between 1999 and 2005; two films in and audiences were really growing tired of his misguided choices and questionable attitude. But for the third and final part of the prequel trilogy, the divisive director and his company sought to improve on the mistakes Episode I and II had made. Did they succeed? Straight and to the point, Revenge of the Sith is almost everything you'd want to see in a Star Wars film, at least in my book.

Three years on from Attack of the Clones, the galaxy is now completely embroiled in a war between the clone armies of the Republic and the legions of battle droids under the command of the Sith lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), as well as the cyborg General Greivous. Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), his wife Padme (Natalie Portman) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor) have fought many a hard battle both physically and psychologically over this time. But as the war nears its end, Chancellor Palpatine (Ian Mcdiarmid) puts his final plans into motion to destroy the Jedi and place himself in command of a new galactic order; the Imperial Empire. Episode III starts off with a bang and rarely lets up through its runtime; the action is both impactful and gripping, while the emotions successfully reach their highest zenith yet. There's a palpable feeling of poignancy and tragedy as we see Anakin fall to the dark side, transforming into the powerful Darth Vader. Furthermore we also see a number of concepts raised in the previous prequels coming to fruition; most notably Yoda's warning that ""Fear is the path to the dark side"". Compounding this positive trend are the action scenes which are given copious amounts of impact; when you watch the furious lightsaber battles between Anakin and Obi-Wan, juxtaposed with the duel between Yoda and the Emperor, you feel a rush knowing that the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance, something not seen since the original films. Ultimately Revenge of the Sith's plot feels both more immediate and more realised than both the previous episodes put together, and it provides a satisfying seg-way into ""A New Hope"".

The cast this time is most definitely standing to attention when it comes to delivering the emotions associated with a tragedy of this scale. Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin is much improved for the final act, yet ironically this mostly comes through the moments which lack dialogue; the scenes where Anakin is alone in the Jedi temple looking across the city and thinking of Padme, as well as standing motionless in the factories of Mustafar accomplish and convey a great deal of internal conflict with Christensen's detailed facial expressions. Natalie Portman is still a victim of some poor dialogue at some points, but she brings to bear the heartbreak and sadness of seeing the one closest to her fall into darkness. Revenge of the Sith also makes worthwhile progression with characters who were already done well; Ewan Mcgregor not only pours all his heart and soul into his last performance as Obi Wan, but he also channels a performance that forms a strong bridge between him and the performance of Alec Guinness from the original films. Revenge of the Sith is also the film where Ian Mcdiarmid really comes into his own as the mastermind responsible for the fall of the republic; you can feel the pure, unfettered evil that radiates from his character. Whenever he's on screen, he's incredibly sinister and manipulative, planting thoughts and twisting Anakin's mind. Aside from some unnecessarily over the top or corny pieces of dialogue, Episode III makes an impression with characterisation where the other prequels failed.

Episode III also sees fit to show off the best and most extravagant special effects in the prequels. The computer effects have received additional layers of detail and now give off a greater sense of believability; a more extensive use of explosions and a greater number of troops on screen at once pulls the audience in, absorbing them into the deadliest battles of the Clone Wars and upping the scale to the highest level. The new locations are just as detailed as others introduced previously; the humongous battle cruisers of the warring armies, deep sinkholes of Utapu, and the raging lava pit of Mustafar are all grand avenues for some of the most action packed battles of the entire saga. Then there's John Williams' score, and what a soundtrack this is. Revenge of the Sith wouldn't create half the emotion it does without the incredibly haunting and chilling songs that dominate and signify the more heart-wrenching moments of the film. Not only is it the best soundtrack of the prequels, it also comes pretty close to standing alongside the iconic tracks from the original trilogy. Just as the acting has progressed to its highest level in the last piece of the prequels, so too does the technical presentation. It's great to see the filmmakers really deliver in this regard.

Revenge of the Sith is the best of the prequel trilogy by a country mile, not to mention a sizeable redemption for George Lucas's flawed cinematic vision. It's still a tricky proposition to gloss over some iffy dialogue here and there, but ultimately this entry is the one that recaptures that Star Wars magic, not to mention appropriately taking the saga into the deepest and darkest of places."
"May 14, 2016",4.5,"Best order to watch Star Wars 
IV: A New Hope (original trilogy)
V: The Empire Strikes Back (original trilogy)
I: The Phantom Menace (prequel trilogy)
II: Attack of the Clones (prequel trilogy)
III: Revenge of the Sith (prequel trilogy)
VI: The Return of the Jedi (original trilogy)
VII: The Force Awakens (sequel trilogy)"
"May 13, 2016",5,One of my favorite Star Wars.
"May 12, 2016",5,"I know that till this day the prequels get a bad rep. but too me this is also one of George lucas masterpieces. everytime I watch this movie it brings me to tears. anakins tragic story is one that will never be forgotten. the whole story has been about anakin and his family all along, I feel if u can not appreciate the sequels then u simple do not appreciate the series as a whole."
"May 09, 2016",3,"Revenge of the Sith has many of the same problems as the other prequels: cartoonish action sequences, wooden acting, painful dialogue, tonal dissonance. But the Emperor is fun as an over-the-top evil villain, and the final dual between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi is thrilling (and helped out by John Williams's amazing soundtrack)."
"May 08, 2016",4,"Best of the prequels.
Emotionally compelling, and delivers a fun yet depressing ending."
"May 08, 2016",5,Star Wars Episode III Revenge Of The Sith is definitely a big improvement on the phantom menace and attack of the clones it's my favourite Star Wars film in the entire saga I also like The Force Awakens too
"May 08, 2016",2,Natalie Portman is pretty. That's the only good thing.
"May 06, 2016",5,Love this movie! Really awesome and definitely the best of the prequel trilogy. The lightsaber battles are awesome and the plot is excellent! Very good and even though it has some flaws this movie is incredible to watch! Must see.
"May 05, 2016",3.5,"OK, this completes the Starwars prequel Saga, and that's all. Still have the pedigree of starwars saga : underdeveloped characters, boring storyline, but the scene where how dark vader come is great enough to cover every flaws this movie have."
"May 03, 2016",5,The best of the entire Star Wars franchise. We finally see Skywalker become you know who! Best action and story. 95 out of 100
"Apr 27, 2016",4,Though The first half is very corny and slow paced. The last half finds the darkness and substance that rivals the empire strikes back. Even though some of the acting is shaky the great cast helps you past it. revenge of the sith is the best of the prequels and gives us some of the magic of the OT.
"Apr 26, 2016",1,"I just don't know what to say.  Er... Thank you, Disney. You took Star Wars away from Lucas. Revenge of the Sith was hopeless ending of ruined prequel trilogy."
"Apr 24, 2016",5,"7/5.
The level of work and detail put into this film was just amazing. Lucas' directing was on point, the perfectionism amazingly satisfying, telling a rich and horrifyingly sad tale of the downfall of Anakin Skywalker.  I really haven't seen a film this good in ages."
"Apr 22, 2016",3,"Después de dos intentos por fin hay una trama mas completa, al igual que más acción dentro de película y por fin caracterización de personaje.
Los efectos son de los mejores de esta trilogía, como también la banda sonora de Williams es impecable.
Pero sigue pecando en los horribles diálogos por parte de Anakin y Padme, al igual una que otra actuación mediocres."
"Apr 20, 2016",4,You only need to watch the first battle and then skip to when Obi-Wan confronts general Grievous.
"Apr 14, 2016",2.5,Seriously the worst dialogue ever. How high was George Lucas when he wrote this script?
"Apr 11, 2016",5,"Not without its flaws, but still a satisfying and masterful conclusion to George Lucas's epic. The prequel trilogy suffers from its reliance upon supporting materials like the Star Wars: The Clone Wars TV series to put events in context. However, when paired with said show, this is the superior Star Wars trilogy, proof that George Lucas should have been given the director's chair again."
"Apr 11, 2016",4,The movie And actors themselves wasn't horible but not as good as return of the jedi or A new hope.
"Apr 10, 2016",3.5,Star wars episode 3-Revenge of the sith is the best of the three prequels but still has issues. Anakin's transformation is way to  quick.There is only a few scenes of the Emperor seducing him but they are all really good.The effects have improved but some parts on Coruscant look really fake. The end fight drags on for way too long and is so choreographed that it becomes boring. The movie is very bad at conveying emotion between the characters.The writing is still bad. Besides that the movie is really good and i recommend it to any star wars fan.
"Apr 09, 2016",3.5,"Good action,effects, and a strong ending, this movie truly feels like star wars,but was still a slight letdown"
"Apr 02, 2016",3.5,"The horrible acting, dialogue and chemistry is still there, but hugely reduced and a yet again more interesting story mixed with good enough emotion and visual effects make this the best of the prequel trilogy.

"Mar 27, 2016",3.5,Better than the last two
"Mar 26, 2016",4.5,"While it may stumble in some departments, Revenge of the Sith is much more emotional and powerful film then we have seen before in the Star Wars saga. The action is intense and spectacular, the scope massive in scale and epic in it's execution and the ending bittersweet. A return to form on many levels."
"Mar 26, 2016",5,this star wars movie is good the cgi is ok the storyline in great it's a good star wars movie.
"Mar 25, 2016",3.5,"Amazing action, better acting and a tear dropping ending makes this the best movie in the prequels"
"Mar 24, 2016",5,"I love this movie so much, the visuals, the battles, the soundtrack, just everything. A truly epic conclusion to the prequel trilogy that transitions perfectly into the OT."
"Mar 24, 2016",5,My personal favorite starwars film.
"Mar 24, 2016",5,episode 1 2 and 3 are my all time favorites. it was meant for you to destroy the sith not join them!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amazing scene.
"Mar 23, 2016",1,"79%? This movie is less crappy than the other two, but that doesn't make it any good!"
"Mar 22, 2016",4.5,"I love the dark story, yet Hayden Christensen is AWFUL."
"Mar 22, 2016",1,"New star wars sucks!
Female main character turns Star Wars to Hunger game or Twilight :("
"Mar 21, 2016",4.5,"A great send off for the prequel trilogy that would complete the saga full circle. Although a little hard to watch after Anakin turns to the dark side and all the Jedi start to be killed, the climactic fight scene makes up for it with flying colors. I salute you George Lucas."
"Mar 20, 2016",4.5,"Sith get's unfair critiques sometimes, understandably by fair critiques of the former two Prequels. However, this Shakespearean Space Opera is near perfect and deserves the critical acclaim it has received. The weaker dialogue is no weaker than moments found in the hallowed Original Trilogy and the strongest of the dialogue is actually Oscar worthy. Mainly that of Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine / Sidious. Ewan McGregor is more than believable as a young Obi-Wan and brings more gravitas while Hayden Christensen actually knocks it out of the emo park as a suitably conflicted Anakin Skywalker. The love dialogue is still written in a way that no actor could truly say comfortably, but let's keep things in perspective. It's passable and nowhere near the debacle of the romance of the former Attack Of The Clones. Ultimately, this movie succeeds in creating a truly mythic experience. The first time I saw this, I really felt like I descended into Hades, this is a most rare success and makes it a worthy prequel to the uplifting A New Hope."
"Mar 17, 2016",3.5,"Out of the 3 Star Wars prequels, this one is probably my favourite. 5 and 6 are probably my favourite though."
"Mar 15, 2016",3,"What Revenge of the Sith lacks in character, it makes up for with thrilling, consistent action, nifty visuals and suprising emotion."
"Mar 13, 2016",4.5,The ending of this trilogy is a pretty great one despite the fact that no one in this movie can act to save their lives.
"Mar 10, 2016",5,Awesome just awesome
"Mar 10, 2016",3.5,"Though unable to touch how well put together any of the original trilogy movies were, Revenge of the Sith is a vast improvement over it's two predecessors. The writing has improved and the storytelling is certainly far better than any other Star Wars prequel. A fitting story to show the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker, and the rise of Vader and the Empire."
"Mar 10, 2016",3,"Too much ""Disney"" touch"
"Mar 10, 2016",4,Good but overrated. This movie is certainly not the best Star Wars movie. It is no better than Transformers 1.
"Mar 09, 2016",3.5,This is what the whole trilogy should have been focusing on. The whole point of the trilogy was to see the main character's downfall from promising knight to horrible dictator. This movie however brought a semi-interesting closing to the trilogy.
"Mar 09, 2016",4.5,Easily the most enjoyable and exciting Star Wars movie to date.
"Mar 09, 2016",2,"It was kinda meh, super predictable. Maybe would recommend if nothing else was on..."
"Mar 08, 2016",4,"Despite many of it's problems being the same from the last two instalments of the trilogy Revenge of the Sith suitably fills in all the wholes between the originals and the prequels, making for one investing and action packed end to a trilogy.

B+"
"Mar 05, 2016",3.5,"Personally my favourite star wars prequel, although thats not saying much. Is the movie perfect? No. It does have its flaws in things such as dialogue and sometimes the movie is quite boring. But those two things are much worse in the phantom menace and attack of the clones. Theres much more action in revenge of the sith and the dialogue is greately improved. This movie is certainly not my favourite star wars film, but it sure as hell is enjoyable, and wraps up things nicely between attack of the clones and a new hope."
"Mar 03, 2016",1,"Grade: F (25%)
Rating: 2.5/10 - Awful"
"Mar 02, 2016",4.5,It was really amazing and the actors were really played well. I could feel the emotions brought by them into the movie. The graphics were absolutely fantastic with many incredible animation. I was interested by the lightsaber duel. It was an elegant technique there. Overall the plot was good. I could say that this one was the best among other episodes. Such a masterpiece!
"Mar 01, 2016",5,"Revenge of the Sith is arguably the best prequel of the Star Wars saga. We finally see the birth of Darth Vader, one of the most ruthless Sith Lords in the Star Wars Universe."
"Feb 29, 2016",4.5,Really enjoyed lt one the best movies in the franchise more plot in the first 10 min than the whole of the force awakens.  ( well except for that Darth Vader NOOOOOOOOO scene.)
"Feb 28, 2016",3.5,Worth the watch......obviously.
"Feb 26, 2016",0.5,unbearable... the worst from the saga ever made
"Feb 26, 2016",5,la mejor precuela de star wars
"Feb 26, 2016",3,"Probably the only film in the prequel trilogy that's worth rewatching...once, maybe twice."
"Feb 24, 2016",0.5,the first one with darth vader i more with the that is for rotten
"Feb 19, 2016",4,"this stetted  up episode lV PERFECTLY don't believe me it hade this huge plot beginning to end setting up episode four did a great job like all the duel serisly all of the lightsaber duels dooku, grevious, palpatine, palpatine again and the best of them all darth vader (Anakin Skywalker) this should not and never be hated im not 100% sure if its my favorite 4 stars 86%"
"Feb 17, 2016",3,"The prequel was finished the journey, and this one, really really low energy
Except for the lightsaber duel, it's was good"
"Feb 15, 2016",3.5,I don't know why people dislike this movie it's better then the other 2 prequels and maybe as good as return of the Jedi.
"Feb 07, 2016",4.5,This sci-fi movie adds a dramatic twist to Star Wars. Pretty much every performance is great although Hayden Christian is a bit off. The fight scenes are visually stunning.
"Feb 04, 2016",3,"I generally like this film, it could obviously be improved but a good watch."
"Jan 31, 2016",4.5,"While very entertaining, the dialogue is quite awful but the visuals, the storytelling, and the action are nearly perfect."
"Jan 30, 2016",5,SHIT ANAKIN CAN KILL ME DADTH VADER NY FUCKING-OH MY GOD
"Jan 30, 2016",4,"Oh, my god... ¡Pero qué carajo...! ¡Esta película es lo máximo! ¡Odio a Anakin porque se vuelve malo, pero esto...! Guau, es la mejor de todas, y la batalla entre Obi-Wan y Anakin, guau..."
"Jan 29, 2016",4,"""Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith"" (2005) tells the story of the rise of the Dark Force, the Sith, and the fall of the Galactic Republic. Our hero Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) along with the other Jedi Knights are working to overthrow Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). Meanwhile, they are neglecting the real leader behind the Dark Side of the Force, Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid).

Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) who is secretly betrothed (a no-no for a Jedi Knight like himself) is given to ever greater feelings of insecurity about losing those closest to him. We see Chancellor Palpatine begin to exploit this insecurity to turn young Anakin to the Dark Side.

The film concludes with an epic battle on a lava planet that is not to be missed. For fans of the series, or those newly interested, because of battle scenes like this finale and the ultimate transformation for young Anakin to the Dark Side, this is one of the better films in the total Star Wars saga, not better than ""Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) or the newest installment, ""The Force Awakens"" (2015), but perhaps tied with ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983)."
"Jan 27, 2016",5,"I'm happy how this movie got down to action and fighting there where great battles and I like the fight with light sabers it was pretty intense movie with drama my favorite character was Anakin Skywalker, obi-Wan Kenobi. If you like Star Wars then you will be glad to see this!! Light saber battles are great in the Star Wars movies!!! Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker wow how they fight against each other was just down to hard fighting so intense that you could watch it over and over again!! It's a tuff fight with drama. And much more!! Pick your side the light side or the dark side."
"Jan 26, 2016",3,"Ah, now the saga is now complete. Star Wars Revenge of The Sith, is the best movie out of all the prequels, even though it's the darkest movie out of the saga, next to Empire Strikes Back, it does a good job telling the final part of the story as Anakin Skywalker, played by Hayden Christensen , turns into Darth Vader, defies his, and the Jedi's beliefs. And turns to the way's of the Sith, and becomes the greater evil, he was chosen, and swore to destroy, and was suppose to bring balance to the Force."
"Jan 25, 2016",5,"Very ingaging story, and the best action in a star wars film.Its a worthwhile experience"
"Jan 23, 2016",5,"Revenge of the Sith is one of my favorite Star Wars movies! It's very very sad but also very very action packed and amazing! I was sitting on the edge of my seat when I first saw this movie, it is so suspenseful! It's really really sad when Anakin turns to the dark side because he's such a heroic character and then at the end, he just transforms into something that is very very dark."
"Jan 19, 2016",5,"My Favourite Star wars, It Brings both trilogies together. I was so excited to see this."
"Jan 18, 2016",5,"Say what you will about the prequels but this was my favorite star wars movie of all. the battle scenes in space, the lightsaber duels between the characters it was just amazing"
"Jan 17, 2016",5,Great acting and great plot. Lucas show how he grew up as a director in these years. More complex film that let behind the childish first 3 movies
"Jan 15, 2016",3,Best of the prequels? Not saying much really
"Jan 15, 2016",3.5,"Finally a good Star wars movie brought back to the screen.Is it just me,or is it because it is not rated PG."
"Jan 13, 2016",4.5,The romance in this movie is off the charts I wish anikin doesn't turn but that's inevitable
"Jan 12, 2016",3.5,"With the last two being heavy blows to the Star Wars community, Revenge of the Sith has the best visual effects of any the of prequels before it, has the most dark and compelling drama of the prequels, and probably the best soundtrack of the three films. It is the Star Wars movie people wanted to see back when Phantom Menace was released in 99. Though it still isn't without its plot holes and clunky dialogue."
"Jan 11, 2016",2,"Terrible acting throughout and only two scenes throughout the film were actually good and quite wonderfully shot. One scene is the scene that goes in depth with Palpatine speaking of Darth Sidious and his powers with great acting and is honestly the best scene in all three of the prequels and the other scene is the show down of Obi-Wan and Anakin although the dialogue was un-tasteful I enjoyed it, another thing I give credit to is the scene where there is silence and you can feel the emotions instead of hearing awful words from the characters mouths. Honestly you can watch this one and find enjoyment so watch it just skip some scenes."
"Jan 10, 2016",3.5,The best in the prequels for sure. Not as good as the originals. Ewan McGregor agian is the best thing in the movie. The action sequences are amazing but the story is a little rough in the corners. But still the best in the prequels.
"Jan 10, 2016",3,"Revenge Of The Sith is superior to the other two prequel Star Wars movies. It has better acting, great special effects, and is just overall enjoyable. Still isn't all that great though."
"Jan 10, 2016",3,"It's ok, but I grew up watching the original three.  This film was very predictable so it was just ok.  One of those movies that there is not a lot of interest to watch a second time."
"Jan 09, 2016",4.5,"The only film in the prequel trilogy that can compete at a similar level with those of the original trilogy. Ultimately though the film has found itself to be underrated due to its associations with the two earlier films if the trilogy despite clearly standing above them in quality.

Rating: A-"
"Jan 08, 2016",2,It's the best prequel... Which really doesn't say much.
"Jan 07, 2016",3.5,"Redeeming little of the ponderousness of Episodes I and II, Revenge of the Sith nonetheless manages to entertain while it brings a surprising level of satisfaction to this origin story's curtain-closer. So over-stuffed with plot points that it makes you wonder why they wasted so much time on needless exposition in chapters one and two, this go-round still doesn't achieve the same feel as the much superior first trilogy but it manages to thrill and satisfy at many junctures.    

In this PG-rated sci-fi adventure set three years after the onset of the Clone Wars, the noble Jedi Knights are spread out across the galaxy leading a massive clone army in the war against the Separatists. 

The audience has already resigned themselves to the fact that this prequel trilogy got aimed at a wholly different (read: younger) audience than the much superior original trilogy. That being said, Revenge of the Sith gets a lot right. Over-reliance on soulless computer generated effects aside, the battles never disappoint. Also, emotional screams aside, our (anti) hero's transformation into the iconic Darth Vader gets tastefully handled. Filmgoers might not have known or cared what transpired in the two preceding chapters, but this go-round conjures up poignancy and excitement in spades.

Bottom line: Sweet Revenge"
"Jan 07, 2016",3.5,"Well, this episode looks firm, with its dazzling special effects and countless fight\action scenes, with its dark tone and bitter ending showcasing the events prior to the original 1977 movie."
"Jan 06, 2016",4,"Star Wars Revenge of the Sith is by far the best film of the 3 prequels.  It has the most action, the best acting and it has the best moments out of the 3 prequels.  Ewan Mcgregor does a great job as Obi-Wan Kenobi again, Ian Mcdiarmid is fantastic as The Emporer he just makes that character so good.  The lightsaber duel at the end of the film is one of the best duels out of any of the 7 films which have been released.  There were not many down points to the film.  One thing that improved slightly but was still a bit cringeworthy was some of the dialogue, especially between Padme and Anakin.  The way that Padme died was pretty lame, it would of been better if she died because of being force choked by Anakin.

Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader was well done, even though they rushed it a bit at the end with the suit and how it was all put together.  Probably the worst thing about the movie is when Darth Vader screams Noooooo!, everything up to that point was good.  He force crushes everything around him and gets angry and that should of been it, the Darth Vader we see in the original trilogy doesn't scream Noooo! or show much emotion,

The ending to the film is really good, it links Episode 3 to Episode 4 nicely.  It is a good ending to a prequel trilogy that started off badly."
"Jan 06, 2016",5,"Although the first two prequels were (in my opinion) terrible. This movie brings Star Wars back to life with epic action scenes, colorful and dark characters, and a whole heck of a lot less Jar Jar"
"Jan 05, 2016",5,Is the best prequel and is a great Star wars movie
"Jan 05, 2016",4.5,The best prequel Episode.
"Jan 04, 2016",3.5,"The final film in the prequel trilogy is the only legitimately good film in said trilogy. Better paced, acted, and visually executed than its predecessors, Revenge of the Sith manages to overshadow its overreliance of CGI and its rough around the edges dialogue with a poetic yet bleak tone and some thrilling action; the final act in particular stands out. Verdict: B"
"Jan 04, 2016",5,Impressive. Most impressive.
"Jan 03, 2016",3,"Palpatine is at his finest, but the lack of buildup in the previous two films make the character arcs feel rushed and unbelievable. Anakin's turn to the dark side, though understood, is sudden and awkward. The final battle between Anakin Obi Wan should have been an epically gut-wrenching struggle, but it failed to deliver due to poor writing and a lack of development in their relationship."
"Jan 03, 2016",1,"People will clap for just about anything these days. 
The fact that some fans laud this movie as a return to the greatness of the original trilogy is disturbing to me. The emperor is truly not wearing any clothes, which, incidentally, would be more interesting than the plot of Revenge of the Sith. 
This movie is not an improvement over Attack of the Clones. The dialogue is still terrible. The characters are still flat. The action is still lost in a dense CGI landscape. The audience is still told what to feel. There is no honest friendship or passion or betrayal or temptation. Let's face it: Jar Jar wasn't the problem. 
Let's start at the beginning. No one should be proud of a continuous tracking shot DONE ON COMPUTERS. There is no craft at play here, let's not kid ourselves. 
Second, this entire space battle has no point and doesn't advance the plot in any way. Anakin is never punished for beheading Dooku. There is no motivation given to go after Greivous again. It serves no purpose. 
Which brings me to General Greivous, a cartoon robot, literally and artistically. What's his motivation? What makes him so bad? Does he know that he's just a pawn for Emperor Palpatine? No one cares, least of all George. This character is here to sell video games and action figures. 
But I digress, onto Padme and Anakin's secret romance. I will give Hayden Christensen some credit here. There is a moment after Padme says that she is pregnant, when Anakin appears pissed off and uncomfortable with the news that he's suddenly going to be a father. LIKE A REAL PERSON! However, he quickly gets over this honest reaction one second later and goes back to being a one-dimensional character. 
Both Portman and Christensen are given lines that no one, not even Meryl Streep and Daniel Day-Lewis, could save. Everything is shown to us via words: ""We are in love."" What does Padme like about Anakin? Seriously. What is there to like? What does Anakin like about Padme? Is she smart? Brave? Funny? We may never know.
Moving on. One of my biggest problems with the prequels is how Anakin turns to the Dark Side. In a movie like The Godfather, Michael Corleone turns to the Dark Side. This happens slowly without him even knowing. It happens decision by decision until we get to the final scene in the movie, and we, the audience, and Kay, his wife, realize that he's a completely different person than he used to be. That's what happens in real life, after all. No one sets out to be a bad guy.
After I saw the first movie, I assumed that Anakin's motivation for turning to the Dark Side would be helping his mother. In Phantom Menace, Shmi mentions that the Republic doesn't exist on Tatooine, which is why there is slavery. In Attack of the Clones, Anakin even hints that he supports a dictatorship over a democracy. If the writers were smart, they would have slowly transformed him into an agent for the Republic and then an agent of the Empire. 
Instead, they throw in this ridiculous plot device with the dream of Padme's death and Anakin wanting to save her. Not only does this not make sense, but it flies in the face of all the subtle seduction the Emperor has been doing all along. This ain't the Godfather. It ain't even Godfather Part III. 
To this point, the deleted scenes with Padme forming the Alliance should have been (re-written) and  included in the final film. They could have provided a logical explanation for why Anakin and Padme parted ways. Instead, Anakin never even finds out about Padme's links to the resistance movement, and Padme never leaves Anakin, as any smart woman would do after she finds out that her husband is a murderer of children.
Younglings. Enough said. 
The fight between Yoda and the Emperor is creative in some minor aspects. I like that the Emperor is literally destroying the building blocks of democracy by throwing the discs at Yoda. However, this scene tells us nothing new about the Force. No new powers are revealed. Instead, we get more meaningless lightsaber nonsense. Is Yoda's cane just for show? 
Couple more small things: 1. Dying of a broken heart is fine, but a medical robot shouldn't be involved in that diagnosis. 2. Leia remembered her mom. 3. This movie didn't need to be PG-13 to be dark. 4. How does lightning make someone's face old? Couldn't the Emperor in ROTJ just been really old? Did we need an explanation for that? 5. Mace Windu's dialogue is so cliche-ridden, it hurts. 6. Jimmy Smits looks ridiculous driving that space Corvette with Yoda. 
I could go on and on and on. 
Like Attack of the Clones, this movie has no heart and soul. 
Only two things help this movie rank slightly above Attack of the Clones. 1. Ian McDiarmid is an underrated actor who can say just about anything and be honest and interesting. 2. The final shot looking off into the sunset is beautiful, though painted with too many perfect CGI details.  
To be clear, this movie did not redeem the prequels. Space politics was never the problem. Jar Jar was never the (biggest) problem. It all comes down to human beings."
"Jan 02, 2016",4.5,Great end to the Star Wars prequel trilogy.  I would love to see what mostly practical effects would have made this film look.
"Jan 02, 2016",3.5,this is not the best move but I think it's a good move :)
"Jan 02, 2016",3.5,"The Star Wars prequel conclusion is an answer to prayer for many fans, learning from the mistakes from the previous two episodes. The action is even better than before, the plot holes are miraculously (and sometimes unbelievably) filled, the stock characters are reduced, and it attempts to return to the grand and epic drama of the original trilogy. However, it cannot help but feel uneven at times, thanks to the poor set-up of attack of the clones and the huge amount of explaining it has to do. Unfortunately, it cannot completely free itself of the mistakes the previous two made, and some of the character development scenes are questionable. Still, it contains some of the most effective sequences Star Wars has seen so far, and brings the prequel trilogy to a satisfying and action-packed conclusion."
"Jan 01, 2016",5,This movie did a great job in showing the transformation from Anakin to Darth Vadar. The movie aided me in empathizing and understanding the reasoning behind Anakin being tempted and manipulated to joining the dark side. I find they couldn't have rounded off the prequels in a better way. They couldn't have done anything better with this movie. It's one of my favorites of the entire Star Wars saga.
"Jan 01, 2016",3.5,"It's the strongest of the prequel trilogy and a pretty good movie. Does it compare to the original 3 movies or The Force Awakens, no it doesn't but you should still check it out."
"Jan 01, 2016",2.5,"The only watchable movie of the prequels.  Still overloaded with CGI and bad acting, but neither are as bad.  I'll even say Anakin wasn't nowhere near as annoying as the last movie.  Last fight was awesome...for the first 5 minutes.  Just went on for too long.  Palpatine stole show every time he was on screen and easily the best thing about the prequels."
"Dec 31, 2015",1.5,"Not as bad as the other prequels, but still a bad movie with wooden acting, moderately confusing plot(better than episodes 1 and 2 but still), and terrible CGI. However this film has a little more heart to it and the action scenes seem less dance-like and silly. It's a meh movie with some good points but honestly it has more negatives than positives."
"Dec 31, 2015",4.5,"The Star Wars Saga is Now Complete

Originally Written May 19, 2005--
It has been three years since the Clone Wars began. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from General Grievous, the commander of the droid armies, but Grievous escapes. Suspicions are raised within the Jedi Council concerning Chancellor Palpatine, with whom Anakin has formed a bond. Asked to spy on the chancellor, and full of bitterness toward the Jedi Council, Anakin embraces the Dark Side.

The Star Wars Saga is now complete. This is the chapter we have all been waiting for! The only Star Wars film to be rated PG-13, ""Revenge of the Sith"" finally reveals how the world we were introduced to in ""A New Hope"" 28 years ago came to be. Without question, this is the darkest chapter in George Lucas' six film saga, but it's also the most rewarding. A lightsaber duel to end all lightsaber duels, a Master Jedi fighting against a Sith Lord, and the introduction of a Wookie named Chewbacca, this film has it all! The only question I have is why did it take so long to get here? Four-and-a-half stars out of five."
"Dec 31, 2015",3.5,"""Nooooooooo"" ~ Darth Vader"
"Dec 31, 2015",5,para mi es el final perfecto de esta trilogia.
"Dec 30, 2015",4,"Episode III is obviously the big payoff to the slow burning prequel trilogy, and it's one of my favorites of the franchise. For all the pacing problems in the first two prequels, this movie is firmly on track and building towards its finale, which is one of the most iconic moments of the saga. On a side note, I always loved the concept of General Grievous, and he's a good B-plot in the movie. Half droid, half organic, feeling unwell, kind of a nice mix!"
"Dec 29, 2015",5,"This movie, (along with Return of the Jedi), are tied for my all time favorite movies. I absolutely loved how there was a display of emotion through the characters! Anakin's fall to the Dark Side and his ultimate doom during the Mustafar duel with Obi-Wan to become Darth Vader is perfect. The soundtrack complements the movie, and in all, it makes a wonderful addition to the saga!"
"Dec 29, 2015",4,Loved it as a kid but watch again and still liked it but not overly as excited as most. I'm not a big d SyFy person.
"Dec 29, 2015",2.5,"Revenge of the Sith feels closer to star wars than the past 2 films. Though it is uneven, has stiff acting, and is at times, ridiculous!"
"Dec 29, 2015",5,awesome!loved it clapped and cheered!â?º
"Dec 29, 2015",3.5,"the best of the three preqeuls but the writing it still bad but it had some grea
t action"
"Dec 28, 2015",4.5,"Say what you want about George Lucas, he executed this movie perfectly. The opening was great, there weren't that many boring talking scenes and if there were they were shorter or had something of interest, the visuals still hold up today, and the ending actually kind of made me tear up."
"Dec 28, 2015",2.5,"Final de la trilogía de precuelas de ""Star Wars"".  Las buenas noticias: Jar Jar Binks casi que ni aparece.  Las malas noticias:  todo lo demás: Vacía, con pésimas actuaciones, inconsistencias y peleas sin emoción. ¡Snif!"
"Dec 27, 2015",3,This second trilogy is nowhere near as good as the first.
"Dec 27, 2015",4.5,Really good movie but not good enough for a five star
"Dec 27, 2015",3.5,"Much better than 1 and 2, and in my opinion unfairly lumped in with them as poor quality experiences."
"Dec 27, 2015",5,"Go on hate this Episode, I'll defend it. Stop blaming Hayden. He's a damn good actor, he was just given a very bad script. He did a very good job portraying our Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader. For crying out loud! Of all the prequels, this one's my favorite even though I really loved the prequels, tbh, the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones were awful WHEN you compare it to the sequels, but still enjoyed it. Those movies were my childhood."
"Dec 26, 2015",4,Though it had some minor flaws like a rush starting and other things. It was really a solid finish for the prequel's. Great great graphics. Amazing set up for the original trilogy. It really leaves you wanting to go out and watch the original trilogy again because it sets it up so well. Not that bad of a movie nice solid ending.
"Dec 26, 2015",3.5,"Awesome movie!
One of the best yet. Must see!"
"Dec 26, 2015",3.5,"This is probably my favourite in the star wars series. It provides the transition between the prequels and the latest movie. It includes the biggest moment in the story, the moment the whole franchise is built upon and its done very well. Hayden Christian develops as a character, and the terrible Phantom Menace and Attack of the clones are completely forgotten about. Even with out the others this one can entertain as long as you've heard of Darth Vader."
"Dec 26, 2015",4,"A solid ending to an otherwise disappointing trilogy. Dialogue still felt robotic in some areas, but did have depth in areas needing it most. More passion in this movie then its previous 2."
"Dec 26, 2015",3.5,Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith is no doubt the best of the prequel trilogy.
"Dec 25, 2015",3,"All flair but very little substance. Initially enjoyed this film upon its release; however, repeated viewings expose the wooden acting, shallow plot, and illogical/confusing character motivations. I still laugh so hard at the Frankenstein ending. John Williams' score is incredible, and helps provide the film with an illusion of greatness."
"Dec 25, 2015",3,"The first Star Wars movie in the prequel trilogy that actually feels like a Star Wars movie only in looks but not in tone . This movie still has bland acting, dull characters and story flaws. The 45 minute lightsaber fight at the end seems more like a 20 minute dance off than an actual fighting scene with characters we are emotionally invested in."
"Dec 25, 2015",3,The best of the prequels (that's not saying much)
"Dec 25, 2015",0.5,"the disgusting prequel trilogy ends.the plot is garbage,the actingsare terrible and the reason why Anakin became Darth Vader it's idiotic.the only good thing with this movie is nothing"
"Dec 25, 2015",5,Saddest and most interesting of the Star Wars movies. This movie should bring you to tears if you are a Star Wars fan! Darth Vader is born and we are all worse for it.
"Dec 25, 2015",3.5,this is the best Star Wars prequel by far and I believe that Hayden Christensen adapted into his role as Anakin Skywalker seeing as he could shoot an intimidating stare when he's not saying any stupid dialogue not to mention the painfully obnoxious Jar Jar Binks does not have a single line in this film looks like George Lucas learn something for once
"Dec 24, 2015",3.5,"Rating: 72%
The plot is still questionable, but the better action scenes, special effects, and even acting make Revenge of the Sith the most enjoyable of the prequels, although it still trails the originals by miles."
"Dec 24, 2015",3,"Another improvement on the prequel series. Still cheesy, but less talking with Natalie Portman &amp; Hayden Christensen helped the movie."
"Dec 24, 2015",2.5,Shaky conclusion complemented by poor acting; left too many questions unanswered.
"Dec 24, 2015",3,BETTER THAN THE OTHER 2 BUT STILL ONLY AVERAGE....
"Dec 24, 2015",2,The romance scenes and Hayden's acting again ruin this movie.  All the Palpatene scenes are awesome.   However they ruin general Grievous and then use the shitty version of Grievous in the new tv show.   movie isnt completly with out its merits but has big problems.  Movie contradicts info in the original trilogy as well.
"Dec 23, 2015",4,Pretty Dark. I like how the lead you up to the point that Anakin discovers that Palpatine is the Sith. Anakin is full of anger and turns dark. 
"Dec 23, 2015",4.5,Criminally underrated.
"Dec 23, 2015",4,this was the best movie of the prequels. I enjoyed seeing the ending ark tocthe Darth Vader story line. one of the better star wars movies.
"Dec 22, 2015",1,"I wish to god I could give this no stars. This is a giant turd of a movie, just like episodes 1 and 2. I can barely remember anything about them because they bored the crap out of me. All I remember is jar jar binks, the terrible acting of the kid playing vader, and all the digital effects. The computer generated yoda is just so bad. I mean, the old ones blew these out of the water. This is just awful. I want the last two hours of my life back. I'd rather watch lizards do push ups in my yard. Or an infomercial on the slap chop. Or my cat using the litter box. Literally anything else. Anything. Else. Literally."
"Dec 22, 2015",4,"A highly underrated movie. Not bad compared to the other prequels, but not at the level of the originals by any means"
"Dec 22, 2015",2.5,"the problem with prequels is that everything becomes predictable -- we're just waiting to see HOW things turn out that way. While this one doesnt suffer as badly as the CGI-ridden Attack of the Clones, there are some major problems: the worst overacted actress award goes to Natalie Portman, and Lucas for feeding her the ""Oh Love shall conquer all"" lines. Whatever happened to the strong Queen Amidala?? And letting the resident Hispanic Organa adopt the lily white baby named Leia ? Well, at least she got the 'tude that she will eventually dish out to Han Solo, but messy it is, messy it is indeed."
"Dec 22, 2015",5,Best out of the prequels. Personal favorite of all the Star Wars movies. It has the great story of the originals and the visual effects of the prequels.
"Dec 22, 2015",4.5,"With the exception of some poor acting, it was pretty good."
"Dec 22, 2015",3.5,"This movie is surprisingly good. George Lucas took what we hated from AOTC and TPM and got rid of it. I mean it still has cheesy dialogue and boring camera shots, but all the actors seem to put on their best performances of this prequel trilogy. There is actual emotion in this movie that was not present in the first two."
"Dec 21, 2015",3.5,"An improvement, no doubt, on the previous two prequel instalments, with a more darker film. Nevrtheless, it remains at times very uneven and at times very impressive and rather unique. Hayden Christensen is still laughably diabolical at acting."
"Dec 21, 2015",5,"I honestly think this is a great Star Wars movie. Extremely entertaining. Awesome music, great fights, decent dialogue."
"Dec 20, 2015",3.5,"Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a huge step up from the first to prequels. The special effects are improved, but still only decent (definitely not as bad as Attack of the Clones). The action sequences in this are great. It begins and ends with awesome action sequences, and throughout the film there are great ones. It's still uneven like the other two, but definitely not as bad. The acting in it is improved, but still a bit weak. The villains in it are cool, especially General Grievous. So, in conclusion, Revenge of the Sith is a big improvement over the others, but still has some weak points. It is a satisfying way to end the series."
"Dec 20, 2015",4,"Some are calling ""Revenge of the Sith"", the best out of the prequels. Others are calling this great as ""The Empire Strikes Back"". For me, I would say that this is the best out of the prequels.

What I like about ""Revenge of the Sith"" is not because the writing is great, which it isn't, but because it manage to have a dark center around the surface of the film. This is where we see Anakin Skywalker is slowly joining to the dark side. I think the way that George Lucas tells the story in here is nicely done. I also find that the lightsaber battle between Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi is amazing.

There are some weak areas around it, especially where Obi Wan Kenobi is having his last scene with Anakin Skywalker which I thought that was weak in my opinion, but I still liked it. 3/4"
"Dec 19, 2015",3,"While there are enough stand-out scenes (opera house scene, anyone?) and thrilling action to make this marginally more entertaining than the other two, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith still suffers from the vomit-inducing writing and Hayden Christensen's existence."
"Dec 19, 2015",4.5,This film isn't the best but it's the best of the prequels and one of the better Star Wars movies.
"Dec 19, 2015",3.5,"A marginal improvement over the first two prequel movies, but that isn't saying much. Out of context it is an okay movie plagued with wooden acting and near nonexistent character development."
"Dec 19, 2015",4,This is legit star wars. It all comes down to a sinister conclusion. It has the most action and best dialogue of the prequels.
"Dec 19, 2015",0.5,Lucas is an extremely lucky hack that greatly benefited from the talent around him. I'm speaking of the original trilogy of course. Here he displays the result of his dictatorship.
"Dec 19, 2015",4,a respectable end to the trilogy
"Dec 19, 2015",3,less garbage like than Episodes I &amp; II but weak.....
"Dec 19, 2015",4.5,The best of the pre quels. Well structured. Teaches you all you need to know about the Vader/obi Wan/Yoda/Darth sidius history which is developed and finished in the original series. Epic battles. Crazy light Saber fights. Anakin v Douko. Obi Wan v Anakin. Emporer vs both Yoda and Windu? Forget about it. Epic film.
"Dec 19, 2015",5,"I feel this has aged well. Imaginatively it's spectacular. For example, I like the droid General Grievous...as well as the scenes with the Wookies. I also feel Yoda is deftly portrayed, filled with wisdom, and complete understanding of what is going on. One of my favorite parts is when he tells Palpatine he has too much confidence in his new apprentice, and in the dark side. This comment ultimately turns out to be correct, it just takes a few decades to manifest.


I love how this sets things up for the original trilogy, and it all plays out perfectly because George Lucas had it planned. It's not like these movies were an afterthought, so the result is they fit with the original trilogy extremely well. When Palpatine strengthens the republic, bringing the systems together, that is the formation of the empire! At the end Yoda decides to go into exile, to the swamp planet. You see the decaying of the Jedi, and this makes it resonate when, in Episode IV, Obi-Wan talks about the old Jedi. 


The development of Palpatine is terrific, and one of the most horrible parts is when he persuades Anakin to chop off Samuel Jackson's arm. This is the turning point, and from then on Anakin is so twisted-not even evil, but lost, hopelessly confused. He force chokes Padme! I think he still loves her, but he's too twisted; he wants her more as chattel rather than his wife. Also, when you look at Anakin, especially when he's under distress, he looks so much like Mark Hamill, who will be his future son, it's uncanny. 


Mostly this movie is about Anakin, and I think it speaks to the importance of Vader's character that there are three movies basically dedicated to him. The most heartbreaking part for me is at the end when he's rebuilt as Vader, and the first thing he asks, the first words out his mouth, are about Padme. He's too confused to know that part of his life, his old identity, is gone. Then the evilness of Palpatine comes through: he quickly lies to him, grinning, pleased with what he has created. At this point Vader is broken down, incredibly strong with the force but lacking a will of his own. It makes sense how he ends up the way he does. It's beautiful to see him side by side with Palpatine observing the construction of the Death Star, which will set off the rest of the movies."
"Dec 19, 2015",5,This is one of my favorite Star Wars movies of all time. I thought Hayden Christensen gets a bad rap from most fans. He did a good job as Anakin and it is proven in this movie. The ending is the perfect finale for Anakins story.
"Dec 19, 2015",4,The best in the prequel trilogy.
"Dec 18, 2015",4.5,"In my personal and unpopular opinion, this is one of the best star wars episodes. It is the only fully enjoyable prequel episode from start to finish and it perfectly lays the groundwork for the later episodes. The action is intense and spread well throughout the film, the story is incredibly dark, and it's the most emotional of all the episodes. The Jedi's being massacred is one of the best directed scenes in all of the episodes. My only complaints is that the ending seems to drag on a bit and Anakin's change to the dark side happens a little too quickly and unrealistically. 

However, the CGI is kept to a minimum compared to the previous two installments, Jar Jar is only seen once, there is not nearly as many cringe-worthy scenes or dialogue (especially between Anakin &amp; Padme) and the villain is taken seriously for the first time throughout all the prequels. This compliments the later installments for sure without detracting from them at all (except maybe R2 &amp; C3 getting their minds wiped)."
"Dec 18, 2015",3,"By far the best of the prequel trilogy, but Revenge of the Sith is still lightyears away from the quality of the original trilogy. Viewers will be glad to see hated characters be almost completely cut along with the embarrassing stereotypes, and the acting isn't completely unbearable this time around. There are some large inconsistencies in terms of lore, but the end of the film will have you excited to rewatch the latter and far superior half of the saga."
"Dec 18, 2015",3,"Journey to Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens 
Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith - Movie Review
This movie was definitely the best of the three prequels for the Star Wars saga. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean that it was a great movie. Unlike in the two first installments, the Revenge of the Sith managed to bring forth my emotions at a couple of points, but I still could not but laugh whenever the screen was decorated by a so-called romantic scene. Lucas still doesn't know a better way to describe love and emotions than making the characters say them aloud or staring silently into the distance...

Still, I was pleased by this movie and my only wish is that Lucas had made episodes I&amp;II into a single movie (spanning the childhood of Anakin) and not filled them up with useless and meaningless scenes. This third movie shows the strength of a focused story versus the incoherence that episodes I&amp;II represented."
"Dec 18, 2015",3.5,"Far and away the best of the prequels, Revenge of the Sith ejects most of the dull drama in favor of an endless stream of elegantly staged and thrillingly kinetic fight sequences that work in such a way that the film exists in an entirely different league than its two predecessors. The performances from the cast are much more consistent, the connections to the original films are obviously meticulously thought-out (the ship design specifically), and the existence of legitimate stakes allows the proceedings to feel far more weighty than they more than likely have any right to.

It bears repeating that this trilogy is regularly beaten into the ground for all the wrong reasons, this film lazily thrown in with the other two out of a misguided and petulant need to deride anything that doesn't cater to its fanbase's extremely specific set of requirements; to proclaim this final installment a failure in relation the original trilogy is to out oneself as belonging to this childish movement built on the back of entitled tantrums and misplaced nostalgia. Yes, there are a few hiccups that one could decide to single out as the basis of an overblown take-down of a film that doesn't give you exactly what you want, but overall, Revenge of the Sith is a piece of work that earns its place in the Star Wars pantheon on the back of its solid construction and honest-to-goodness fun in a way that Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones frequently failed to.

Sidenote: The jump in quality is exemplified in the line ""So this is how liberty dies? With thunderous applause"", a line that would've been great in a prestige drama."
"Dec 18, 2015",4.5,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith [Lucas, 2005] Great. Kind of the only necessary episode of the prequel trilogy. 9/10"
"Dec 18, 2015",4,"The best out of the prequels by far, A nice easy plot this time not full of council meetings although they're not scrapped completly, The effects were top class but it seems George Lucas can't make a film without making just about everything with them, For me it was the worst acted as I thought some of the performances felt very forced (No pun intended) It's full of action from the word go and all was good fun, It's the darkest Star Wars film ever and it worked well what with little to no humour and Jar Jar Binks being reduced to a cameo so you got to love that, A fantastic final few scenes, Very emotional too, Revenge of the Sith can be proud of becoming a true Star Wars film even if it does have its flaws."
"Dec 17, 2015",5,Hayden Christensen is the perfect Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader. Impressive.
"Dec 17, 2015",3.5,"Easily the best of the prequels, Revenge of the Sith is packed with solid action and finally shows us the birth of one of the most iconic movie villains which is handled quite unevenly at times thanks to the screenplay and the acting."
"Dec 17, 2015",4.5,"It is a shame that the first two prequels were not as good as this one.  This movie is a very solid 9/10 and may be the third best of the saga.  Very dark and it does a nice job linking the two trilogies.  I am still confused why Obi-Wan does not recognize R2 or 3P0 in ""A New Hope"".  I guess he knows their memories were wiped and it wouldn't matter.  The lightsaber duel at the end is probably the most aggressive and best one of the saga as well.  It is also great to see Darth Sidious and Yoda do battle."
"Dec 17, 2015",3,Mixed bag of thrills. I didn't care much for General Grievous or Anakin's fall at the end. I felt that Lucas cheapened the character of Vader by turning him into child killer and slaughtering ugly unarmed aliens with his lightsaber. Could've been better. This one good but not great.
"Dec 17, 2015",2.5,"""Revenge of the Sith"" turns 10 this year and it was the first Star Wars movie I saw in the theater.

This is the movie everyone wanted to see happen because we finally got to see Darth Vader again, but was sitting through the entire movie really worth it? Vader only had about 3 lines and all of them were terrible. The plot of this movie was leading up to this and while it's not a terrible movie, it's not very thought provoking either. It's filler. Not at the level of ""Attack of the Clones"" filler, but most of this movie wastes its time on pointless shit. I don't care about General Grevious, I don't care about Count Dooku, I don't care about Mace Windu, and I don't even care about Anakin Skywalker and his story is the most important one. Hayden Christansen wins ANOTHER Razzie for his portrayal and came off as an absolutely hilarious idiot.

Lucas just doesn't know what he's doing here. Since this trilogy is so horribly written, I like to think of this ""prequel"" saga as a completely different species. They don't connect with the original trilogy in any way, unless Lucas has to modify the originals just so they could somewhat be in the same universe. Sigh...

I do have nostalgia for this third film, but how far can nostalgia really take you once you're not interested in what's even happening?

With the few pros: The CGI is certainly the best of the prequels. Even though they lack any heart or substance, they blend in better with their environments. Ewan McGregor gives his best performance as Obi-Wan and has some of the only few lines of dialogue that are very involving and ones that intentionally made me laugh. Seeing Ian McDiarmid reprise his role as the The Emperor in his prime is a pure joy to watch. I love watching the Emperor in this movie, he's so damn evil but he loves to be evil, and he looks so damn creepy and his voice is so goofy but can still be ominous at certain points. Like usual, John Williams' film score is fantastic and is tied with Ian McDiarmid as the two best things about this film.

""Revenge of the Sith"" is the most decent Star Wars prequel, but it's just gotten so much more uninteresting with time..."
"Dec 17, 2015",4,"visually it is good. the story about being a thriller but not very effective, generally entertaining."
"Dec 17, 2015",5,Just re-watched this and it holds up!  Brilliant movie leading up to the trilogy we all love!  You can feel the dark side in this movie!  Very very well done. Now on to the classics!
"Dec 17, 2015",4,If you ignore some of the horrible dialog then it's just a good action movie I think this one kind of redeemed the prequels a bit... Besides phantom menace dear god... But this movie is pretty good
"Dec 16, 2015",4,"Obviously better than the rest of the prequels. If I had to pick one Star Wars movie that Hayden Christensen was better in, it's this one. Even though he still continues to bring problems into the movie."
"Dec 15, 2015",4,"Revenge Of The Sith might be the only prequel that I approve of just due to it being the film we all expected. What makes Revenge Of The Sith that best prequel is that it's kinda what we were expecting. A dark, gritty, sad film that showed the downfall of the Republic and the uprising of the empire. What I most love about this prequel is how Anakin grows so much darker as it progresses. Not to mention the light saber fights were on point the whole movie. All in all the third and final prequels actually isn't very disappointing and it shimmers some George Lucas greatness."
"Dec 15, 2015",2.5,"La mejor de las tres. Lo cual no es decir mucho.

10 años pasan desde El Ataque de Clones, y mientras las Guerras Clónicas están en su peor punto, la presencia de alguien maligno oculto en la República se hace evidente para los Jedis. Con Anakin (Christensen) cada vez más cerca del Canciller Palpatine (McDiarmid), y con Obi-Wan (McGregor) liderando una ofensiva contra el General Grievous, el Consejo Jedi debe tratar de desenmascarar al Sith misterioso mientras lidia con una Guerra que no da señales de acabar. 

Seguido sucede que alguien me dice que La Venganza de los Sith es una buena película porque es la mejor de la trilogía. Y yo respondo planteando el siguiente escenario: Frente a mí tengo un gran basurero. Y yo saco de ese basurero un pañal usado por un bebé enfermo del estómago. Puedo decir que ese pañal es la cosa con el olor más tolerable del basurero. Pero eso no significa que el pañal deje de ser un pedazo de mierda que pertenece a un basurero. Eso es La Venganza de los Sith, en mi opinión. Simplemente la mejor de un grupo de tres películas mediocres.

El film inicia de forma diferente y novedosa con respecto a las otras películas: de lleno a una escena de acción. Tengamos en cuenta que este film sería el último de la franquicia, por lo que considero que fue una buena decisión.

Sin embargo, también entramos de lleno a un guión que brilla por su debilidad. Un guión que literalmente es la definición del término ""mal desarrollo de personaje"". En una escena podemos ver que Obi-Wan antes de siquiera aterrizar con su nave, salta hacia afuera de ella enérgicamente y comienza a matar droides antes de que Anakin siquiera empiece a sacarse el cinturón de seguridad. Sin embargo, en otra escena, cuando están atrapados en un ascensor, Anakin salta de él mientras que Obi-Wan niega con la cabeza y dice: ""siempre en movimiento"". Ah... Okay... ¿Quién es quién en ésta película? Uno no puede simplemente añadirle características a unos personajes y a la siguiente escena invertirlas. Eso no significa que seas atrevido como escritor. Eso significa que tu guión está por todos lados y te olvidaste, o no te importa, de lo que estás escribiendo realmente.
Y por supuesto, si hablamos de Anakin, debemos mencionar al actor con menos expresiones que una puerta, Hayden Christensen. Me gustaría poder decir que desde el Ataque de los Clones la actuación de Christensen mejoró un poco. Me gustaría decir que, al igual que McGregor y Portman, él trató de trabajar en sus habilidades o en su personaje para poder ser un poco mejor en una película en la que nunca recibirás ayuda de tu director. En serio, me gustaría decir eso. Pero no. O fue muy holgazán para hacerlo o en realidad trató, pero simplemente es su naturaleza actuar horriblemente. Cualquiera sea la opción, su actuación sigue siendo un asco.

Si en el Ataque de los Clones el CGI sufrió un abuso desmesurado, en esta película alcanza niveles ridículos. Oye, George, ¿ves eso al lado tuyo? Es un actor, y es de verdad. Puedes ocuparlo a él en vez de uno que se ve completamente ridículo hecho por computador. Esto alude directamente a mi súper regla de que ""si no estás seguro de que puedes hacerlo bien, no lo hagas y punto"". ¿Para qué escribir una escena en la que Christopher Lee debe dar saltos y pelear rápido cuando claramente a su edad ya no puede y tendrás que reemplazarlo digitalmente? Mal, muy mal...

Y en lo que parece un doloroso recuerdo del Jar Jar de la Amenaza Fantasma, Lucas le imprime un humor precario y crudo a los droides digitales, incluyendo a R2-D2. Si bien en la trilogía original, 3PO y R2 también servían como toque cómico, éste era más sutil y más inteligente. Lógico, diría Spoc. Un humor un poco seco como el de Sheldon en The Big Bang Theory. Pero en este film, los personajes son reducidos a meros comediantes físicos.

A medida que avanza la historia, la dirección de Lucas no parece hacerlo. La narrativa sigue siendo torpe, afectando negativamente a las motivaciones de los personajes. Si uno lo piensa realmente, no hay ninguna razón lo suficientemente fuerte como para que Anakin deba lógicamente unirse al lado oscuro. Digo, tiene visiones de que Padmé morirá, por lo que el Emperador le dice que se una a él para que descubran cómo salvarla. Y una vez que muere, ¿simplemente lo deja ir? Da un ridículo grito de ""¡No!"" y luego comienza a servir al Emperador. ¿En serio? ¿No se siente engañado? El Emperador incluso le dice que en su ira, él la mató. O sea, por volverse al lado oscuro, mató a su esposa, cosa que él quería evitar. ¡¿Y no importa?! Basura de guión.

Pero no todo es malo en esta vida. Hay que sonreírle al mundo porque incluso en esta porquería de film, hay cosas buenas.
Ehm... ¡La música! Sí, la música compuesta por John Williams nunca decepciona. Un sólo vistazo a la partitura para la épica Battle of Heroes y quedas maravillado. Es increíble como este tipo puede crear no uno, ni dos, ¡sino que seis temas icónicos para una misma saga! Bravo, John Williams. Simplemente, bravo.

Dentro del, escaso, desarrollo de personajes, tenemos al rol de Obi-Wan Kenobi. En este film es un personaje digno de ver, pues McGregor hace un respetable, y respetuoso, trabajo tomando aspectos de la actuación del gran Alec Guiness para añadirlos a su interpretación. En algunos momentos, pareciera que realmente estamos viendo a un joven Guiness, por su tono de voz y sus miradas.

Hay algunas escenas que son ""cool"" conceptualmente. Como las tomas de Anakin como Vader caminando hacia el templo Jedi con un ejército de clones detrás de él, o toda la secuencia final de su lucha contra Obi-Wan. Okay, te damos eso, George.
Y el mayor punto a favor del film, ni siquiera es por mérito propio. Es simplemente genial ver como Yoda se exilia al Sistema Dagobah, o cómo Obi-Wan entrega a un Luke recién nacido a sus tíos Owen y Berú, o como El Emperador, Darth Vader y un joven Gobernador Tarkin supervisan la construcción de la Estrella de la Muerte. Pero esas escenas sólo son grandiosas porque nos traen la nostalgia de la primera Star Wars. Nada más.

Así es como George Lucas logra producir la ""mejor"" de las tres, plagiándose y homenajeándose a sí mismo. Como dije, ésta película puede ser el pañal menos maloliente, pero no deja de ser una pedazo de basura."
"Dec 14, 2015",3.5,"ahhhhh bueno todo tiene que llegar a su fin, una pelicula aceptable pero un poco ilogica pero aceptable y hay cosas que no se entienden y cosas sin explicar"
"Dec 14, 2015",4,"Episode 3 is a big improvement over its last two installments (tho still some dialogue issues). This time around we see Anikan starting to turn to the dark side and ultimately become Darth Vader. This movie is more violent, has better visuals, promotes a darker story, and brings more character development than the last two movies did and brings this trilogy to a satisfying end."
"Dec 14, 2015",3,"Episode III kehrt zurück zum klassischen Star Wars Stil der Seifen-Oper. Wir wissen, dass Anakin Skywalker wider besseren Wissens zum Jedi ausgebildet wird und schliesslich zu Darth Vader mutiert. Auch sind wir als gelehrige Star Wars Studenten unterrichtet, dass Luke Skywalker und Prinzessin Leia den Familien-Namen erlösen werden müssen (weil Anakin forthin mit schwarzer Maske Böses tut). Noch aber wissen wir nicht, wie Anakin zur dunklen Seite wechseln wird. Der Kanzler Palpatine bittet Anakin, für ihn zu spionieren - das hat nicht umsonst etwas Unheilvolles... Anakins Wahl des Bösen schliesslich hat einen schmerzhaften Grund und der hängt mit seiner Liebe zu Padme zusammen. Beide haben heimlich geheiratet und nun ist Padme schwanger. Wie auch in Epiode II ist dieser Teil der schwächste des Films, denn Lucas kann einfach keine romantischen Dialoge schreiben. Alles bleibt flach und bemüht. Doch Episode III kann nicht durch Lucas Dialog-Schwäche ruiniert werden, da hier mehr Action geboten wird als je zuvor in einem Star Wars Film. Bewegung im Stakkato, eingebettet in nicht nur atemberaubende Bilder hinsichtlich ihrer Tricktechnik, sondern vor allem wegen ihrer Wirkung. George Lucas agiert hier nicht wie ein Wissenschaftler der Special Effects, sondern wie ein Künstler! Er rundet mit Episode III seine eigens erschaffene Welt ab - so überschwenglich wie wir ihn mögen! Der Druck, nun die Episoden VII, VIII und IX umzusetzen (die Lucas angeblich bereits als Student entwarf) ist deshalb umso höher, da die Kritik an den Episoden I-III nicht gering war. Ich bleibe aber dabei, dass dies ein Missverständnis ist, dem Umstand der Verklärung der ""alten"" Teile geschuldet. mehr auf cinegeek.de http://cinegeek.de/star-wars-episode-3-die-rache-der-sith-star-wars-episode-3-revenge-sith-dvd-29"
"Dec 13, 2015",3.5,"""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of The Sith"" is a great Sci-Fi film of 2005. The plot to the movie is that ""Anakin Skywalker"" portrayed by ""Hayden Christensen"" and ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" portrayed by ""Ewan McGregor"" are saving ""Chancellor Palpatine"" portrayed by ""Ian McDiarmid"" who is a hostage in ""General Grievous's"" ship. After this ""Chancellor Palpatine"" befriends ""Anakin Skywalker"" and shows him the ways of the dark-side. The plot to this movie is great; it's far better than the previous two films. The opening scene of the movie is perfect; it's what a ""Star Wars"" film is supposed to look like. The climax of the film is amazing; ""George Lucas"" did a great job filming the movie's climax. In ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of The Clones"" the dialogue is very cheesy, in ""Revenge of The Sith"" it's still somewhat bad, but it's watchable. ""Anakin Skywalker"" is okay in this movie; he's not as much of an annoying brat as he was in the previous movie. The acting in this movie is good. ""Ewan McGregor"" and ""Ian McDiarmid"" are probably the best actors in this film. The music in ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of The Sith"" is thrilling towards the end, the music at the second last scene is very sad and fits in perfectly with the scene. One thing that's been good throughout the ""Star Wars"" prequels' is the way action shots are filmed, and ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of The Sith"" is no exception. In the previous two films the use of C.G.I. hasn't held up to todays standards, this movie tried to use as minimal C.G.I. as possible. There are a few scenes that C.G.I. is noticeable. If you are a person who enjoys the original three ""Star Wars"" movies' then I recommend you watch ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of The Sith"" as it is a great movie with good acting, an amazing plot and thrilling music. This movie is not perfect it has problems with it's script, ""Hayden Christensen's"" role isn't right, acting could be better and less use of computer generated image. I give ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of The Sith"" a 7.5/10."
"Dec 13, 2015",4,"I gotta say, this is REALLY an improvement compared to the first 2 prequels. While not perfect, it DOES capture the essence of the franchise a lot better than the first 2.

Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is still awesome with his character, Hayden Christensen is... still bad with his voice, but his facial expressions show that he's going dark, the lightsaber battles are still great, and even the CGI is clever! Or at least, compared to the first 2 prequels.

Yeah, there's still a few weird scenes and stupid dialogue, but if you look past that, expect to be impressed. It's pretty emotional, too."
"Dec 13, 2015",3.5,"Most certainly the best of the pre-trilogy films, still some head slapping silly moments however."
"Dec 13, 2015",4,"WHAT I LIKED: Lucas knows what he wants here - 'Revenge of the Sith' has much more direction thanks to a plot that ties everything up really well. It's also very dark, thanks to some exciting characterisation and the music that adds so much to this film. 'Revenge of the Sith' is probably the best it could have been considering what it was left to work with, saved by (mostly) great acting, amazing action scenes, and the whole last 40 minutes which are just spine-tingling in comparison to anything in the other prequels
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It's still bogged down by petty politics and average writing. And like all the prequels it still suffers from being pretty dragged out too
VERDICT: A memorable and moving Star Wars prequel finally worthy of a place in the trilogy."
"Dec 12, 2015",5,"This is easily the best of the entire prequel trilogy! This is how every prequel episode should've been, great, not mediocre or bad. The story continues and we follow Anakin and Obi-Wan uncovering deep secrets about the Republic and its Chancellor. Anakin is being more and more tempted by the dark side until he finally gives in and it's amazing. Hayden Christensen finally plays his character well! I haven't had any problems with this movie, to be honest. I loved how the last hour of the movie was depressing, dark and flatout insane! The change in the characters' natures was amazing. I loved the scenes after Chancellor Palpatine ordered everyone to turn against the Jedi. It was very heartbreaking to watch them, though. Also, Padme and Anakin finally shared some good on-screen moments. It wasn't nearly as awkward and cringe-worthy as it was in the episode 2. Obi-Wan and Anakin fight was hard to watch. There were so many emotions during that fight. I really loved this episode if you can't tell by now. I'll just say that I would be really pissed if I hadn't seen the original trilogy before this. I feel the original movies would be a bit ruined if you see the prequels first and therefore recommend you to watch the original trilogy first if you haven't seen any of the movies yet. All in all, Revenge of the Sith is the best of the prequels and I really loved it!"
"Dec 11, 2015",0.5,"There are worse movies than Star Wars episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Those are called Star Wars episode I and Star Wars episode II. In the end, everything I could say about it has been said and explained better and more competently than I could ever do by Mr. Plinkett of RedLetterMedia. By the way, his reviews are more entertaining than the movies, plus they have a teaching value, so... check them out, maybe."

""The Dark Side in all it's horror"""
"Dec 10, 2015",4,The best and most watchable of the prequels. Still has some issues with the dialogue but not nearly as much as Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace. Hayden Christensen is okay once Anakin goes evil until the end then his line reading are pretty horrible. I would recommend this movie to a fan for sure but a light recommend in general.
"Dec 10, 2015",4.5,"Not only is this the Star Wars story we have all been waiting for, it is an improvement from the last two prequels. The cgi improved, the dialogue is better but it gets wooden at moments. Hayden Christensen slightly improved but his acting is still corny. All in all this is the best film from the prequel sage."
"Dec 10, 2015",3.5,"I don't think Lucas was capable of making an 'excellent' film after A New Hope, so Sith is (I think) rightly considered his second best film. It's easy to watch these films and see only the problems; the dialogue and acting seem almost purposefully awful, Anakin's descent into Vader is absurdly steep given how much set up time he's given, and the admittedly badass lightsaber duel on Mustafa goes on far too long. That said, I don't think any Star Wars fan can resist what these films add to the lore. You're really watching it for the fiction, the incredible world building - achievements on a grand scale, that leave all nuance completely wanting."
"Dec 07, 2015",4,"A lot of people would agree that this movie is the greatest of the prequel trilogy. We all knew that Anakin would eventually turn into Darth Vader. This movie is darker than the Empire strikes Back. While this movie is good, its not without flaws especially the final 6 minutes(after the fight) they were poorly acted and should have held much more impact. The fight scenes between yoda/the emperor and obi wan and Anakin where incredibly directed and it was a blast seeing them on the big screen, because unlike the first two movies these fights were very emotional and the stakes were high."
"Dec 06, 2015",4,Now that's a prequel... Dark &amp; emotional.
"Dec 06, 2015",3.5,"Mejor que sus predecesoras, pero no tan espectacular como la trilogía original."
"Dec 06, 2015",3.5,"Anakin already wears black all the time, presumably in preparation for becoming evil. PadmÃ© gets knocked up and rocks a foreshadowing Leia hairstyle. Obi-Wan befriends a giant lizard and kills General Grievances. Anakin decides to join the dark side because he thinks it's the only way to save PadmÃ© from dying during childbirth. His name gets changed to Darth Vader. Basically all of the Jedi get murdered. Obi-Wan cuts Anakin's legs off and he gets burnt up in lava fire. He's gonna need some sort of breathing apparatus to fix this one. PadmÃ© gives birth to Luke and Leia and then dies."
"Dec 06, 2015",4,"A prequel finale that feels as though it is racing against time to tie off its plethora of loose end plot lines, while still having some fun along the way. (B)"
"Dec 06, 2015",4,the most fun of the prequels. the opening space battle is a blast. Order 66 is heartbreaking. the ending makes you want to watch A New Hope immediately.
"Dec 05, 2015",3.5,"This is not only the best of the prequels, but it is also probably the closest to the original trilogy. While the dialogue is bad and painful to listen, Lucas decided to add scenes of emotional turmoil and man it was really really good. There were times Hayden Christian looked like the ruthless Sith Lord. Even his transformation to the dark side is difficult (even though you knew it was going to happen)."
"Dec 05, 2015",4,"The final installement of the much derided prequel trilogy and out of them, Revenge of the Sith not only surpasses the underwelming last entries and is possibly ,in my opinion the best film since Empire Strikes Back.

Don't get be wrong though, the flaws of Phantom and Clones such as awful romantic dilogue, Hayden Christain's wooden acting and some massive continuty errors with the orginal trilogy regarding Anakin's motivation to become Vader, Padme's fate and the removal of cruical scenes that set up both the formation of the Rebel Alliance and Yoda discovering Dagobah.

However, what's great about this film is extreemly well done rather then just ok. The opening space battle is really entertaining to watch, Ewan MacGregor, Frank Oz and espiecally Ian Macdirmind give some of the best prefomances of thier careers, John Williams's score is scend only to The Epire Strikes Back as my favourtie Star Wars Soundtrack and the final 50 mins havve some of the best moments of the entire franchises such as the Jedi Purge, Yoda and the Emperor using the senate platroms as battering rams via the force and the final duel between Obi-wan and Anakin set on the Star Wars's version of hell, Mustafar.

Overall a much more satisfying film then Phantom and Clones, and despite still having a few major hiccups with the dialogue and the story, did manage to serve a fitting finale to a legendary series (for 7 years that is..)"
"Dec 05, 2015",4,"Sentimentally this is my favorite (although that may change soon). I can remember watching the first scene and jumping up and down in theatres. Beyond that though the dialogue, the acting, the story are all leagues better than the first two. Some scenes are downright hard to watch as Anakin falls to the dark side. The final fight between him and Obi-Wan is the best fight in the entire prequel and original trilogy and I will defend that until my last breath."
"Dec 04, 2015",3,The best of the 3 prequels but still not amazing. Some good acting from Ewan McGregor who proves to be the best part of the prequels. Let's hope the new trilogy learns from the mistakes.
"Dec 03, 2015",4,My favorite by far of the newer trilogy! It's epically dark and unbalanced  in a perfect way!
"Dec 02, 2015",2,I got the reveal I wanted.  The first breath was amazing.  Sadly the rest of the film...wtf?
"Dec 02, 2015",4,"Despite the first two films ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"" Revenge of the Sith is a breath of fresh air. My only problem with this film is a waste of Padme and Obi-Wan. Sure you need Obi for the end of the film. But Lucas should of used Padme in this film. Her acting was amazing and she was under used. I felt like when I was watching this film Lucas was thinking ""What should I do with Obi Wan?"" Another problem with this film is how the jedis died so easy in order 66. Lucas should of let the Jedi have a fight with the clones. While the final duel was awesome they didn't have to make it so crazy. In Return of the Jedi the duel was more emotional and it was just in one room. I wanted something a little less in the final duel. The ending for this film was perfect."
"Nov 29, 2015",4.5,The best of the prequels. The opening sequence and final lightsaber battle between Obi-wan and Vader are breathtaking. The visuals are amazing. The characters show true emotion especially Ewan and Portman. The film still suffers from dialogue that falls flat in some scenes and not enough practical effects. Overall best of the prequels and a great movie throughout.
"Nov 29, 2015",3.5,a major improvement from the previous film
"Nov 29, 2015",4,REWATCH. The best of the prequels.
"Nov 28, 2015",3,"After two let down prequels, we finally got a new Star Wars that at least came close to what a Star Wars film is supposed to be. Now to start off and I am going to get a lot of hate for this, I liked Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker! Now won't get me wrong most of his dialogue is complete and utter literary garbage which makes the character seem like a crybaby, however when Christensen has no dialogue and just uses his eyes and his facial expressions he does it very very well. Now, what else did I like?
1. I liked Ewan McGregor as Obi-wan and Ian McDiarmid continuing his role as The Emperor as these are the strongest performances in the film.

2. The drama is fantastic in this film combined with the excellent score by The Legendary John Williams.

Now, what are the faults? The first issue I have is the amount of CGI in the film. The original Star Wars were revolutionary in their effects, here everything you see is obviously fake, which I think is a little lazy. I also wasn't a big fan of Natalie Portman's character/performance, watch the film and see why. In conclusion, it's not a bad film, 3/5 stars."
"Nov 28, 2015",4,"While it's script could certainly use some polish, The Revenge of the Sith is the most stunning, thrilling and intense chapter in the Star Wars prequel trilogy,  making up for it's predecessor's mistakes."
"Nov 27, 2015",3.5,Best of the prequel trilogy but ....
"Nov 26, 2015",4.5,Everyone hates this movie but I love it personally it's my favorite I like it when the bad guys win spoilers but not really if u know anything about star wars
"Nov 26, 2015",3.5,"Despite George Lucas presenting yet another confusing plot, this installation in the star wars franchise still proves to be better than the other prequels with its many thrills and action sequences. My score: 69 ""Somewhat Good"""
"Nov 26, 2015",5,What amazing special effects. This is probably the best Star Wars movie. It had a great story to it with heart breaking scenes. The CGI and special effects were the best. Just all around a great movie with a great ending.
"Nov 26, 2015",4,"This movie is actually pretty great. It still has a lot of stupid Hayden Christensen acting, but this time it pays off. It is dark, griddy, thrilling, and the story is there. A somewhat satisfying final part of the overall disappointing prequel series. The continuity got lost by the end thou."
"Nov 25, 2015",1,"Better than prequels I &amp; II, but that does not mean much at all. Some good aspects, but fails overall. I have nothing to add to Mr. Plinkett's (Red Letter Media) masterful review."
"Nov 24, 2015",3,The most satisfying out of all the prequels.  That's not saying much.
"Nov 23, 2015",4,"Many fans will probably crap on this one but despite not having the same charm in the visual effects and some cheesy dialogue, the underlying meanings actually make you think a lot and much of the story and this script doesn't rely on structure from the original 3rd film which actually makes it not only the best of the prequels, but a great edition to the Star Wars universe that not only shows us interesting things we've never seen, but the things we actually wanted to see in this whole prequel trilogy."
"Nov 23, 2015",5,I don't care what all the crybaby fan boys say this is a great star wars movie only reason lots of star wars fans hate it is because they let the Phantom menace and attack of the clones ruin it for them.
"Nov 22, 2015",2,Best one of the prequels with acting and effects but the script is still awful and so is Hayden Christensen in every aspect of everything he does
"Nov 21, 2015",4.5,Really liked this one very close to the original in my opinion would have like to have kept Leia birth a secret that remained for Jedi.  But we cannot have everything.
"Nov 20, 2015",0.5,"must-watch science-fiction epic configures something for all audiences. a convictive arch between two trilogies coalesced with dynamic and filmic battle scenes give 'episode iii' an enduring, universally mythical quality. it also handles scenes of repose far nimbler than its two precursors. not only devises canny character growth, but avows a highly tangible - and enjoyable - outlook of how malevolence assumes control."
"Nov 19, 2015",4,The best of the second (first) trilogy.
"Nov 19, 2015",4,"Released approximately a decade ago, when this film was particularly the biggest film of the year, I can most certainly say it still holds up incredibly well. 'Revenge of the Sith' is the most climatic chapter in the Prequel trilogy, this is the story which connects both trilogies consistently in an incredibly concise and dramatic structure. Packed with the visual effects austerity that has certainly aged well a lot more than it's predecessors, even with a more darker and foreboding tone never seen in the franchise since, not to mention the incredible action and space battles at hand that have made this franchise so iconic to begin with. Episode III also has some of the franchises most powerful moments, evoked through George Lucas' sheer power of the mythology. It might also be the best Star Wars film with the best sense of compelling characters and incredibly rich and diverse character development all throughout. On a last note, while it's often said this is favorably the best quality film in the entire Prequel Trilogy, (despite very little cheesy moments of stumbling, it can be tolerated) never once letting viewers turn away from the magnificent story, scale and subject matter at play the franchise has always treasured and has always been defined by."
"Nov 19, 2015",4.5,"Revenge of the Sith is actually really good. I was actually surprised by how good this movie turned out. It's like everything that made Ep.II a nightmare had been fixed, particularly the dodgy CGI. 

The way that the movie manages show the descent into evil is brilliantly done. Unlike the previous movie, it opens with Anakin and Obi-Wan working together in a credible, fun relationship (which really shouldn't be a compliment) and a very cool action sequence. 

The whole subplot with the battle against the Separatists and General Grievous is a brilliant distraction to hide the more important events surrounding Anakin and Palpatine, which works on multiple levels and delivers a heavy dose of fun action before the real plot kicks in. 

For once, every actor gives a good performance, even Hayden Christensen who somehow turns his previously creepy character into someone we care for and can believe his descent into darkness. 

The final act is actually quite emotional as Obi Wan sees his friend become a foe, while Yoda comes to terms with the new Empire. That's something that Ep.II could never dream of, and honestly makes Revenge of the Sith one of my new favourite movies."
"Nov 15, 2015",2.5,"I think everyone says this film is good, solely because of the final few scenes, but honestly it's nothing special, don't get me wrong, the final battles between Obi Wan, Anakin, Yoda, and Palpatine are great, but everything is what you'd expect from these Star Wars prequels: Bad CG, Wretched lines, and Padme, who I just hate. Speaking of which, the scenes where she delivers Luke and Leia are some of the most embarrassing I've seen."
"Nov 15, 2015",2.5,"The best of a bad bunch, and ultimately you get your payoff. In many ways it just underlines how pointless the other two were. It's still too long, but does have a discernible plot. Christensen is truly appalling though, and did it really then take twenty years to build the Death Star?"
"Nov 15, 2015",3.5,This third instalment provides us with some interesting moments which link into the original (fourth) movie. There is more emotion and real conflict in this Star Wars film.
"Nov 08, 2015",3.5,"Ok let's face it, the prequels suck compared to the original trilogy. But episode 3 was BY FAR the best of the prequels. Sure, it still was overloaded with CGI, meager acting, and a fair bit of cheese, but the story was a powerful entry to the Star Wars franchise. Let's not forget the great Order 66 scene or the Mustifar fight. Just watch this movie after watching the first two prequels. You will be impressed"
"Nov 07, 2015",3.5,Not quiet enough younglings killed by Anakin
"Nov 05, 2015",4.5,"the best Star Wars prequel with a dark, depressing, and overall serious demeanor which the previous two films lacked. Overall Star Wars Episode III is a must see for almost any Star Wars fan."
"Nov 01, 2015",4.5,"Rating: 9/10

Warning, this is a very long post!

Revenge of the Sith was one of my favorite Star Wars movies and it still remains the case. It also is one of my favorite movies in general. As Attack of the Clones, it's also a tough review and I needed some time to put in place my thoughts about the movie.

Before I get in to it, I have to say that this was the first Star Wars movie I've ever saw 10 years ago when it was first released and it blew my mind when watching it the first time. Before watching this movie and becoming a Star Wars fan, I already had a preference for science-fiction movies and space-operas in anime and mangas and in other TV series. Back then, if I would compare what I've experienced previously with everything related to science-fiction and space-operas with this movie, Revenge of the Sith really surpassed my expectations and what I liked about this genre when I was a teenager. Back then I also was very interested with the subjects related to our real world's history, like the World War II, to mythology and to philosophy. And Star Wars, especially this prequel, has really managed to combine very well those different elements and that is what I liked very much about this movie. It was an enriching experience when I've watched the first time. This movie also unleashed my imagination and when I was younger, I used to do a lot of drawings about the space-battles, the ships and the planets. The battle of Coruscant is my favorite opening in the entire Star Wars saga along with the one of A New Hope since you jump immediately on the action. I certainly have a lot of nostalgia surrounding this movie.

Today, it has been more or less 8 to 9 years since I've not watched this movie and when rewatching it again after all those years, it was a little bit difficult at the beginning to recapture the feeling of what it was when experiencing your first Star Wars movie. Part of that reason might be because I've watched it many times and I already know almost every detail about it and another reason might me because, as an adult, I might have a different perspective about things. But it doesn't mean that I like it less than before. In fact I still love this movie.

Unlike the first two Star Wars prequels, there's a lot more things happening in Revenge of the Sith and the events are taking place somewhat faster. I could say that this movie could have been divided into two separate movies. The story is a lot more interesting and enriching on this point. What I really like about this movie is how the universe that was exposed in the first two chapters toggles and is approaching itself to the universe exposed primarily in the originals, not just in terms of visuals and designs (by design we can think about the first Star Destroyers owned by the Republic, the first X-Wing fighters and Tie-Fighter, etc...), but also from what we learn from the characters and the dialogue: for example when Obi-Wan shares to Anakin his concerns about Palpatine gaining more and more powers and controlling more the senate and the Jedi Order, and when Padme is starting to think that the democracy they all fought for once has ceased to exist, etc... Each scene in this movie felt to be very important. I heard some people complaining that it was too little, too late in this movie or, since there was more important things going on in this movie that the two previous movies, Episode III was more as bottled mess and things were forced. But I rather think that this transition from the prequels to the originals in Revenge of the Sith was handled very well. Sure, it would have been interesting to see the deleted scenes between Bail Organa, Mon Mothma and Padme about the creation of the Rebellion. But I think that since Lucas must have listened to the critics about The Phantom Menace, he wanted to lighten a little bit the political plot and make it easier to the audience to understand, thus the importance to pay attention to the dialogue. The political plot is exposed very well as it is through the dialogue (hence the importance to pay attention to what the characters say instead of saying that ""it's boring""), so I don't think there is a need to add those deleted scenes, otherwise it might weigh down the pacing of the movie.

But even if the political plot is exposed as it is, I cannot help myself to sense a feeling of menace and somewhat of despair when the characters are sharing their worries and fears about a democracy becoming slowly a dictatorship in those scenes. The cinematography and the music used in this movie are also doing a very good job to pass on this feeling.

In terms of visuals and cinematography, it's a pretty dark movie, and I found it to be very effective in order to translate the tone of the movie. In almost every scenes occurring on Coruscant, there's always a sunset, and the sun is being almost hidden by clouds, meaning in a certain way the beginning of the end or the fall of the light side and the destruction of the dreams of a better world. Even the characters are being sometimes hidden in the shadows, translating very well the atmosphere of the movie.

I've found the scenes between Anakin and Padme to be very well done and their relationship felt to be more natural and a lot less honeyed than in Episode II. Two of my favourite scenes between Anakin and Padme are when Padme announced to Anakin that she's pregnant and the actors managed to translate very well this mixture of fear and happiness about the news. The other one is when Anakin wakes up in the middle of the night after having a nightmare and I've rather found that Hayden Christensen acted very well, when waking up, sweating and being troubled by his dream, translating very well his fear. I have never noticed it before listening to the podcast of Trek.fm concerning Episode III (https://soundcloud.com/trekfm/the-602-club-45-more-than-a-feeling), but in this scene when Anakin shares to Padme his nightmare, there is a lot of subtext. Padme's first reaction when Anakin tells her that she would be dying during childbirth is to ask him: ""And the baby?"" while touching her belly and Anakin was being dismissive saying simply ""I don't know"" and tells to Padme: ""I won't lose you the same way I've lost my mother"". This scene really shows that Anakin didn't want to save Padme only because of love, there was much more behind his motivations to choose the Dark Side than just love. There was greed behind his motivations: not accepting to let go of things or people he doesn't want to lose or not accepting the way nature is being made as it is as Yoda said in a later scene: ""death is natural part of life"" which is true since we are facing death almost everyday around the world.

One of the parallels I can make with Anakin wanting power in order to defy death and then losing his humanity as a consequence is with the backstory of one of the manga series I'm currently reading Fullmetal Alchemist. The two main characters of the story, Alphonse and Edward, who are brothers, wanted to use alchemy in order to resurrect their dead mother but then failed and had to pay a heavy price by committing a taboo: one loses his entire body and the other loses his leg and arm. Edward even says later in the series: ""When you get too greedy, it comes back and bites you. See this? I wanted to bring someone back from the dead, and this is what I ended up with.""

And I think this is the main theme and morality in Revenge of the Sith and the entire Prequel Trilogy: greed and lust for power always turn against you and you'll have to pay a heavy price. After all this is also one of the reasons why the Republic and liberty have fallen, because of the greed of The Trade Federation, the greed of the separatist leaders building an army in order to impose their claims to the Republic and making a deal with the Sith, and the greed of the Emperor and Anakin. Even the Jedi, who were supposed to be the guardians of peace and justice, were ready to defy their own code in order to maintain the democracy by spying the chancellor, by ordering to Obi-Wan to destroy General Grievous rather than capturing him, or Mace Windu who was ready to kill Palpatine instead of arresting him and putting him in front of the trials. The only character who still wanted to preserve this good and this idea of justice in the galaxy was Padme, especially on that scene in which she was asking Anakin to talk to the chancellor and convince him to stop the war and let the diplomacy do his job. While you think about this, she's in reality a good character.

Many people were blaming the fact that Anakin's turn was too quick. But I rather think that his journey to the Dark Side was made gradually with all the events that occurred since Attack of the Clones: the massacre of the Sand People, the death of Count Dooku, his refusal to comply with the Jedi Council's orders, the fact that he is tempted to learn a power which will allow him to cheat death, thereby committing a taboo, the betray towards the Jedi, the massacre of the Jedi, the fact that he refuses to listen to Padme about convincing the chancellor to cease the war, the fact that he Force chokes her, the fight against Obi-Wan, etc... I think that he was taking one step after another to the Dark Side.

Concerning Hayden Christensen, I've got nothing to reproach against him, in the contrary I've found that he was decent and there were few moments in which he kind of shines, like the moment in this Jedi Council room when he says the reserved ""What?"" The first time I've watched the movie, that little moment was enough to show the uneasiness between Anakin and the authority of the Jedi Order, especially the confrontation towards Mace Windu. I think that his acting was very subtle and it managed somehow to translate his inner conflict: he believes that what he wants and what he's doing is good, but at the same time he's conscious that it is against the Jedi rules.

But two of the shining points of Revenge of the Sith are certainly the characters of Palpatine and Obi-Wan played by both Ian McDiarmid and Ewan McGregor. You can't easily detach your eyes from the character of Palpatine, he really steals the show. Concerning Ewan McGregor, I liked every scenes in which he is in this movie and watching again the scene in which he yells at Anakin after cutting his limbs on Mustafar is still very emotional.

There are many scenes that I liked about this movie like the scene with Padme's rumination in the middle of the movie, the execution of Order 66, and the birth of the twins and the reconstruction of Vader at the end of the movie. When I was watching this movie for the first time, I couldn't help myself to get excited when watching the final scene with the twin sunset and it was at this moment that I wanted to watch all of the other Star Wars movies.

The CGI was a lot better than the two previous movies, especially Attack of the Clones. They improved a lot the CGI Yoda by adding more of textures, thereby making him look more real. It was really hard, even impossible, for me to tell the difference between what was ""real"" and what was CGI. The special effects on this movie still hold up very well today.

This movie also has my favourite music and soundtracks in all of the Star Wars movies such as Battle of the Heroes. The transition from the prequels to the originals is also done brilliantly by adding the music from the original Star Wars at the end. And replaying those old themes and music at the end of this movie always give me the feeling that this is the end on some way, but also the announcement of a new beginning.

I'll wrap this up immediatelybecause there are so many things to talk about this movie and so many things that I like about it that I don't think I'll be able to finish this post.

But I have to say that Revenge of the Sith is certainly one of the most important and pivotal episodes in the Star Wars saga along with Return of the Jedi: in Return of the Jedi we see the indestructible good overcome the evil, but in Revenge of the Sith we see what was supposed to be good becoming evil. This movie, I think, is one of the most ambitious in the Star Wars saga since it combines a lot of stories, themes, symbolism and subtext. It begins with a sense of adventure and a lot of action at the beginning, there's a lot of drama and desperate situations in the middle and it ends up with a light of hope.

To conclude on the prequels, one of the things that Episode III has revealed to me is that, if I would compare the Original Trilogy with the Prequel Trilogy, there isn't so many subtexts and symbolism in the originals unlike Revenge of the Sith and the other prequels. Some fans can hate me if they want to, but I'm not saying that the originals are bad movies, but I've rather found that the story in the prequels was more interesting and deepened than in the originals and they provide an enriching backstory to the original Star Wars from 1977. They may not be masterpieces as the originals but they are not as horrible and catastrophic as many fanboys have been keeping saying during the last decade.

Rewatching these movies after all those years has confirmed to me that many of the critics against those movies are out of proportions such as qualifying these movies to be ""too childish"". I can understand on some degree the disappointment of older fans who grew up with the originals, wanting more of this ""feeling"" of the originals. But what is the point of recycling the themes and stories to make an OT 2.0? I think that it is a good thing that each trilogies stands on its own, having its own themes, feelings and stories, making the universe of Star Wars look larger than it originally was in the OT. And the Sequel Trilogy should also stand on its own, not being a copy-paste of the Original Trilogy. In each of the Star Wars movies something different and new has always been attempted and this is what makes this saga authentic. I think that value-judging nostalgia can be sometimes depressing and saying that one type of fandom is better than the other or that one does not have any taste on movie or have any knowledge about cultural significance or movies in general is untenable and annoying. There's nothing wrong with allowing nostalgia to guide our tastes or our preferences, but measuring things from our own childhood perspective against other people's childhood perspective is what has developed this fracture in fandom, and this has to cease.

To end up this post, I might need another viewing of this movie since there are so many things to talk about it, but I'll give Revenge of the Sith a score of 9/10."

While the first two films were massive disappointments, Revenge of the Sith did well with what it had to work with. The dialogue still wasn't that great but the acting did not seem as bad as episode 2. The action is great and there are loads of it. The opening 20 minutes alone are better than the Phantom menace. Anakin's turn to the dark side is rather sudden and is not as warranted as it should be. we do not learn how he got the name Darth Vader like they promised we would, all we get is Sidious saying hence forth you shall be known as Darth Vader. that is not good enough, also him killing younglings is not the task he should have been given, we should have seen him fighting other Jedi. The fight with Obi-Wan was great for a little while until it dragged on far too long, the end of it was satisfying though. Yoda fighting Sidious was fine, The ending was okay, Darth Vader yelling ""noooo"" did not bother me like it did others. seeing the partly constructed Death Star was cool and Hayden Christensen fit the Darth Vader suit alright. Revenge of the Sith is a satisfying conclusion to a mediocre trilogy. 3.8/5"
"Oct 19, 2015",3,"The only watchable of the three cursed prequel films. Darth Vader is created, Order 66 is executed, the twins are born, and the Jedi are put on the run."
"Oct 17, 2015",3,"Before I watched this film, I knew this was going to be the one that would be the least bad. And I was correct. Revenge of the Sith is easily the least bad of the Star Wars prequels.

While the film started off being just as mediocre as the previous two and had even more obvious CGI, the film slowly gets better in quality. This had the least awful acting from the cast, even from Hayden Christensen who was okay and Ewan McGregor being the standout. The film had a much more watchable and intriguing plot. And the ending I felt was very powerful.

This is definitely the least awful Star Wars prequel, and it is a satisfactory installment to the Star Wars saga.."
"Oct 17, 2015",4,Such A Great Film Best Of The Prequel Trilogy And Had The Best Battles
"Oct 16, 2015",3,It's not the worst of the prequels
"Oct 12, 2015",4,"Big improvement over Phantom Menace. Lucas tries to hold back the awkward CGI characters that plagued the previous two films and bring back the serious tone that made Empire Strikes Back, the best of the Star Wars films."
"Oct 12, 2015",3.5,It was better than I and II.
"Oct 11, 2015",5,"It would have been hard to make a movie like this. We already knew who Darth Vader is, now we learn his backstory. If you liked the other movies, watch this. :) U won't be sorry."
"Oct 10, 2015",2.5,"Better than episodes 1 and 2, but still dull, wooden, and emotionally lacking. Anakin is a terrible character, he's a complaining, angry, stupid, gullible character that destroys all three of the prequels. This movie is the better out of the prequels, but it still stinks."
"Oct 02, 2015",3,"Entertaining sure,but it still has the melodramatic dialogue of Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones."
"Sep 27, 2015",4.5,"I think it's my personal fav, good story, good characters, good effects, good dueling, good music. This is a masterpiece, surprised that it only has a 65%"
"Sep 26, 2015",5,"Personal Favourite Star Wars Film, Lots of Action and was the deepest film of the series from me, especially during the Great Jedi Purge/Order 66. The music was incredible as well."
"Sep 23, 2015",4.5,"In 2005 I thought it would be worse than episode I and II but really worked still not able to match the 3 originals.Get rid of the groans and Anakin burning and some Grevious  parts then it will match the other 4.I saw 7 and enjoyed it.
90%"
"Sep 21, 2015",2,"Just re-watched this for the first time since 2005, and it''s not good. I remember everyone saying that ""this time"" George Lucas got it right and it's so much better than the other prequels. Not true. Hayden Christensen is so awful as moody skywalker. And the transition from slightly doubting jedi to full fledged child murdering sith is just terrible. It's so sudden and doesn't make any sense. Even Natalie Portman looks bad in this one. The character design and environments are cool, but there is so much wasted material. General Grevious (who seems like an interesting villian) is killed at the end of the first act and other environments and planets just seemed forced into the story."
"Sep 21, 2015",3,"While it can't be watched fully by star wars heavyweights without being criticized for ruining the best franchise on earth, it has everything a great sci fi movie should
A PROPER PLOT (ANAKIN STRUGGLING WITH HIS POWER'S AND TURNING INT DARTH VADER), GREAT ACTING BY ITS LEADS EWAN MCGREGOR, NATALIE PORTMAN, IAN MCDIARMID AND SAMUEL L JACKSON &amp; GREAT SPECIAL AFFECTS AND NO JAR JAR BINKS! IT ONLY LOSES BECAUSE HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN WAS TERRIBLE AS ANAKIN!"
"Sep 17, 2015",2.5,Star Wars Episode III was the most disappointing thing since Star Wars Episode II
"Sep 17, 2015",4.5,Definitely better than I and II
"Sep 14, 2015",2.5,Only one of the Star Wars prequels that didn't completely suck
"Sep 12, 2015",2.5,"Granted it is the best out of the prequels, Revenge of the Sith still doesn't hold up compared to the original trilogy, and is long and uninteresting.  The graphics are decent, but the writing and dialogue are terrible."
"Sep 08, 2015",0.5,Undoubtedly the worst star wars film ever made. Acting from all cast members was shocking excluding that of Hayden Christensen # Bad Casting. Jar Jar Binks was not in the film nearly enough and Anakin became evil far to quickly. The only reason this one gets half a star is because of George Lucas' great ability to write dialogue.
"Sep 07, 2015",0.5,"Absolutely god awful!! I tried watching it and it looks pathetic! Acting, sorry CGI, props, characters.  Throw this in the garbage!!!"
"Sep 06, 2015",4.5,"A stunning and truly tragic end to the Young Anakin and Obi-wan Trilogy. We finally see many key events of the Star Wars Saga unfold that lead to the Original movies, such as Anakin’s transformation into Darth Vader, and the formation of the Galactic empire. CGI is more polished than in episodes 1 and 2, even though, it’s kinda still too much."
"Sep 03, 2015",3.5,7/10 An entertaining piece indeed...great finish to the trilogy.
"Sep 01, 2015",3,A mile-long step ahead from Attack of the Clones.
"Aug 31, 2015",5,"Yes the prequels have their problems, especially Attack of the clones. However  ten years on, Sith still holds up as a great film that is worthy of being part of the original films."
"Aug 28, 2015",2.5,It's cool to see Darth Vader I guess.
"Aug 26, 2015",3.5,"I am a huge Star Wars fan, Star Wars was my child hood and I still love it now. I really enjoyed the first half of this movie
I just didn't like how far the director went with Anakins downfall. I mean seriously, for the rest of the time we know Anakin in his adult life we see how deeply he cares for Padme. So it is unrealistic to say the least that he would force-choke her. Kind of far-fetched.
They didn't have to go so far. 
However the many battles in this installment of Star Wars were epic, and it's a good thing since fans did not get enough of that the last two movies.
Three and a half stars"
"Aug 25, 2015",5,"I remember watching this film when I was 10. At school this film was all we all cared about. And when I finally got over that nasty flu, and I went to go see it, it did not disappoint. Great film showing the rise of Darth Vader."
"Aug 25, 2015",1.5,Why do the prequels even have to exist?
"Aug 23, 2015",4,Visuals? Yes! Story? Yes!! Dialogue? Not the best. Love Star Wars and this one gives us some of stuff we're all hoping gets expanded on in the Sequel Trilogy.
"Aug 22, 2015",4,"George Lucas finally gets his act together and concludes this difficult trilogy on an epic high (if bittersweet) note with visual artistry, thrilling action, and strong themes, and only a little amount of lame dialogues and improbability to worry about."
"Aug 21, 2015",2.5,The biggest mixed bag I have ever seen. Sometimes I just don't know how to feel about it. It's that mixed for me.
"Aug 20, 2015",2,"A vast improvement over the first two prequels, but that's not saying much. There is still some nauseating romance dialogue, but the movie is an action movie showing Vader's final seduction into the dark side. In fact, it's shown clear and concisely enough that it renders the first two disasters which slowly and awkwardly documented his transition to the dark side completely unnecessary. However, the movie is still incredibly boring 2/3 of the time."
"Aug 19, 2015",4.5,"The darker Star Wars of the serie,the best of the prequel and the movie who perfectly close this fabulous Lucas' saga!"
"Aug 14, 2015",5,"Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith is close to being the best Star Wars film ever. Don't get me wrong, the level of ambitiousness created by the original trilogy is no doubt better, but Revenge of the Sith gets is great mythology better than any previous film while also being a great, great political thriller, which no doubt credit must be given to Star Wars creator George Lucas. Overall, Revenge of the Sith is near or arguably the best film of the franchise."
"Aug 14, 2015",3,Padme's death is just... wtf.
"Aug 11, 2015",5,The best Star Wars movie!
"Aug 10, 2015",4,"It's much darker than most Star Wars films are. And out of all the prequels, with one being boring and only had two great scenes and the other one being boring, poorly acted and has a false title, Revenge of the Sith is, in my opinion, the only watchable one in the prequel trilogy"
"Aug 10, 2015",3.5,"The best by miles of the prequels and last of Lucas's attempt at ruining my childhood memories of a Galaxy far,far away."
"Aug 10, 2015",2.5,Hayden Christensen will never star in a movie again
"Aug 09, 2015",2,It has ok action and ok acting and moody tenagers it is ok but not worth your time
"Aug 09, 2015",5,favorite star wars movie
"Aug 07, 2015",1.5,"And so concludes the trilogy that ruined Star Wars.  Aside from the CGI catastrophe, but it's the made-for-tv shoddiness that represents the poor production right across the board.  Easily the biggest disappointment in the history of film franchises."
"Aug 06, 2015",5,This movie is amazing a great film action and emotion
"Aug 05, 2015",2.5,"Pretty solid movie, but the acting will kill you."
"Aug 03, 2015",5,"Amazing, love it, the music and the dark tone and Fights love love the special effects the best of all the saga"
"Aug 02, 2015",3,Better then the other prequels.
"Aug 01, 2015",4,"Great film for fans and non fans to enjoy, George Lucas proves that he still has some magic behind him as he delivers a great ending to the prequel trilogy."
"Jul 28, 2015",4,"3rd best installment of the 6 Star Wars films.

Grade = 8/10"
"Jul 27, 2015",5,this is the best starwars movie evermade
"Jul 27, 2015",5,Really enjoyed this one...easily the best of the 3 prequels...and i loved the dark tone this movie had for a star wars film.
"Jul 27, 2015",3,Best of the prequel trilogy but with Hayden Christensen's acting only marginally improved from Clones.
"Jul 26, 2015",4.5,"Okay, Lets get the cons out of the way. There are a few cheesy moments of romantic dialogue. But I still believe this is a powerful movie. Hell, Once you reach the second half, I believe its absolutely perfect film-making. The action is beautiful, the visuals still hold up, the acting is terrific (Even Hayden Christensen is really good) Pretty much from the Order 66 scene (Which after watching Clone Wars is completely heartbreaking now) to the final lightsaber duel, That entire portion is just amazing. Honestly, I stand by this. I think it might be slightly better than ""Return of the Jedi"". Just slightly. Maybe its just the fan in me, But I do think that the prequels, despite their flaws. They're still Star Wars. The characters, the memorable scenes, the heart. Its all still there (Even if it is lacking certain areas)."
"Jul 22, 2015",5,Great wrap up on the prequels
"Jul 21, 2015",3,"The best of the prequels by a far margin. Lucas found out what was wrong with the first two and decided to make a much darker movie, perhaps the darkest of the entire saga."
"Jul 20, 2015",4,Best of the prequels and second best behind The Empire Strikes Back.
"Jul 19, 2015",4.5,"It's, in my opinion anyway, the best of the prequel trilogy. It still has its queezy moments though."
"Jul 17, 2015",3.5,"Of the prequels, this is the one that's actually not bad and is somewhat of a good movie."
"Jul 16, 2015",4,Awesome action actually had some emotion built in to it and fills in a the missing puzzle pieces
"Jul 13, 2015",3.5,"a mess of a film but the best out of the prequels. it sure is silly at times but it does show a darker side the this universe. new characters fell a bit forced for toys even if general Grevious is pretty cool. The battle scenes with storm troopers look like they can do something on some pretty good looking planets. some of the CGI looks aged but some still looks brand new out of this summer's block buster. The score is incredible with ""Duels of fate"" being the show stopper while a rather fantastic fight is happening and if looks a bit Moore natural to the episode one very  coreagraphed . Some scenes feel very forced like Aniken killing the kids, you know a family film. Padamae and Anikens dialog is a little bit better and fresher but tasted like spam when we were promised caviar. Everything elts is OK for a OK film."
"Jul 13, 2015",3,Lucas did this entry completely in front of green screen. There are no real sets or locations so half the time the film looks like a CGI cartoon. What saves the film is John Williams brilliant score.
"Jul 11, 2015",4,"The dialogue is still a bit flat and there's still too much CGI, but this move kicks awesome. So much going on that maybe some of the plot should have been spread out to the previous films. Possibly the most unfairly hated movie of all time."
"Jul 10, 2015",5,"Of Course this is a true film adventure
As long as i watched this more than once has just blown my mind for cool Special Effects and Creative Wonders.
I'm not just playing around I seriously think this is better than attack of the clones and the phantom menace
A Recall to tell what the prequels are this was made after the 4th episode.
Ewan McGregor Plays
Haden Christian is bad at acting but doesn't do too bad playing Anakin.
I Don't care who plays Darth Sidius
But Natalie portman has been in very good movies.

Score: 9/10"
"Jul 09, 2015",4.5,This final installment overwhelmed me more than the two films and definitely it's worth to watch on the day of your favorite third installments! Hayden Christensen May not be the brightest actor but my golly! This film is only the best of the prequel series!
"Jul 06, 2015",3.5,"Despite a number of recognizable flaws, I actually still enjoy Revenge of the Sith. I thought, by Star Wars prequel standards, this is still pretty entertaining."
"Jul 05, 2015",4,"Lucas ends with a bang and finally gets it right. Undoubtedly the best of the prequels, Episode III features incredible visuals, a more focused plot, and memorable action. McCregor gives an even more notable performance, while Christensen is still rough around the edges. Overall a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy and a great epilogue that leads into IV."
"Jun 30, 2015",2.5,"We knew it was coming, but he went so bad so suddenly."
"Jun 30, 2015",3,"Easily the best of the three prequels, Rots proves to be entertaining and satisfying, ripe with lightsaber duels, and fantastic music. Ewan McGregor again does a good job as Kenobi, while this time McDermid does a great job as Palpatine. It doesn't reach the height that the OT reaches but it does come as close as any prequel."
"Jun 29, 2015",4.5,Would have given five stars had Hayden been a better actor
"Jun 28, 2015",5,Best of the prequels!
"Jun 28, 2015",5,You can feel a real connection between Anakin and Obi Wan in this film. 5x than the previous prequels
"Jun 27, 2015",3.5,A really enjoyable movie. The best of the prequels
"Jun 24, 2015",3.5,"This was great, but not as amazing as the Star Wars original trilogy"
"Jun 23, 2015",3,Very underrated. Christianson very much redeems himself from Attack of the Clones.
"Jun 21, 2015",2.5,"Definitely is better than the other two before this one. It's exciting and fast paced, still not that good though."
"Jun 17, 2015",3.5,"I feel unfinished potential in this movie. The story and ideas presented within it are promising and interesting, but the execution is over-dramatized, rushed and immature, even cringe-worthy in several scenes. I want to like this movie but it is really difficult to watch, although it is interesting to reflect on. Perhaps someday a better movie might be made with similar epic scale, classic themes and thought-provoking ideas."
"Jun 16, 2015",2,more of the same. final battle is what the movie but there have been better
"Jun 15, 2015",4,"Thanks it's darker tone, focused narrative, and powerfully executed final act, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is a satisfactory entry into the Star Wars trilogy that the concludes the prequels with sheer majesty."
"Jun 12, 2015",4.5,Best Star Wars prequel movie of course!
"Jun 11, 2015",4,"This was definitely a step up from the last two entrees in the ""Star Wars"" franchise. The action sequences and special effects were far more awesome and stunning to look at. The acting was a step up with some improved performances, and the villains were pretty awesome and didn't feel very forced into the movie with a few exceptions. I even thought that the ending was far better then the last two movies' endings. I even liked that they died down the crumby dialogue a little bit. One of my only major complaints with the movie was that sometimes it got boring and sort of just dragged on a little. With some stunning action sequences and better acting, this Star Wars movie was pretty satisfying."
"Jun 09, 2015",5,Darth vader has been born
"Jun 07, 2015",3,"Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith is one of the movies that are the worst in the series, not to mention some VERY disturbing content. But other than that, it's ok, and has some action here and there, but tries more to shock you with intense moments."
"Jun 05, 2015",3,The best one of the prequel!
"Jun 03, 2015",4,"Already into the third film and still no saving grace from the prequels. It has it's action going for it, but the acting has been abysmally lost from the first film, no direction except a delivery of lines like that out of a low-budge sci-fi.
Turning these films into PG approved movies for children instead of the soap opera masterpiece's like its predecessors were.

This is what I was thinking throughout the duration of the film, I have seen the series before; so I knew the epic-ness that was coming my way if I just stick in there a little longer. I don't know a film series I rate on respect, instead of how good it is. I now know, like everyone else, why Lucas made those dreadful excuses of great re-imagining of his series. Picture the scene, it's night mid-90's George Lucas awakes in a wet-sweat, unsure whether he is really awake or still roaming in slumberland, because he figured out an amazing, catastrophically brilliant ending to a prequel he has not even written yet. I am trying to say this film saves it self with it's amazing ending.


Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is being kept hostage by Droid Separatists , Supreme Commander Greivous. Two Jedi Knights (Obi-Won &amp; Anakin) must save Palpatine from the General. After Swiftly saving him- a warm welcome awaits the victorious Jedi Knight's. Anakin and Padme are in a heavy love affair, a secret one. They secretly wedded at the end of The Attack of The Clones. Padme is pregnant. Anakin gets a sinister premonition of a possible future were having the baby *baby's, will kill his beloved Padme. This one thought of losing her, sets in motion a steady, and dark decent into destinies arms. The Sith Lord has big plans for young Anakin and his children will hold greater dates with destiny then any one could have possibly imagined.
The fall of the Mighty Jedi Council and the smoldering creation of Darth Vader.


It's one liners are corny, and off putting in the beginning. One in every six work without sending anger-venom pulsing into the main vain. The CGI spam from the other films follows with a breeding frenzy, it's neither better nor worse then the other special effects, but it is noticeable when the actors are in front of a green screen.


The force. A trivial subject in the prequels that get life revitalized back into it with this film. Senator Palpatine is explaining to curious Anakin how Darth Sidious (a powerful and great Sith Lord) could bring back the dead and prolong life. Sparking Anakin's brilliantly performed and executed journey to becoming Darth Vader, played by Hayden Christenson. Unlike the others, there is an actual scene that is the best and in my opinion the best scene in the prequel Trilogy.
 The Sith Lord has been revealed. Jedi Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and Anakin are split between whether to kill or take the Sith Lord to the Jedi Council. Without spoiling a film that has been out for nearly a decade now, Anakin does not allow Mace to kill his new Master.

All the other films should have been this good, Revenge of The Sith is average, but it is the best one. The First film is a full-blown kids film. The second is still very much targeted at snot-nosed kids who don't know the difference between Jedi or Sith, but is abundantly better and more enjoyable, especially it's action. This one, the third, merely a good action drama. but for any one who have seen the originals before, it is expanded by fan-ism, making the most coolest person Geek out.

This film is everything the prequels should of been and it is still so wrongly portrayed in the beginning. It starts like the rest, but goes darker more Gothic, but not to much to the point of emo type of goth. A good film for once, but still shows its fugly-ness, don't matter how much C3-P0, Darth Vader, Yoda or Chew-Bacca are flaunted on the screen to tangle our hearts strings. But a fucking amazingly geeky ending, that made me question my harsh approach to the first film, only for a few second, until I heard Jar Jar open is mouth. Good film."
"Jun 02, 2015",3,Stars wars revenge of the Sith review: I thought this one was hurried. It's like Lucas couldn't wait to Finnish it. I found it lacked juice. I liked the ending that set up the real trilogy. I'll give it 6 out of 10 for great fight scenes and kinda setting up the next three
"May 30, 2015",4,"The writing has only slightly improved, but there is finally enough content to give the actors some space to work. Despite the series' missteps, the culmination of all the previous events still leads to an epic and (surprisingly) emotional payoff."
"May 28, 2015",1,"Their is only one mediocre scene in this movie, the rest is garbage"
"May 23, 2015",2,Much better than any of the other prequels but still a far inferior film to the original trilogy. Poorly written and weirdly acted despite an engaging story.
"May 23, 2015",3.5,"Hayden Christensen totally redeemed himself in this in this installment of the prequels, and my favorite part was having Darth Vader. This was one of the best Star Wars yet."
"May 23, 2015",4.5,"Finally a good Star Wars prequel! This one is pretty entertaining and interesting. It has a pretty decent story, cool action sequences, pretty good visuals, and that's probably about it. Does this movie has flaws, yes a few, but not a ton like episodes 1 &amp; 2. It's a pretty good movie with some emotional conflict and a dark tone. It used to be the best Star Wars prequel , but sadly rogue one has earned that title, but still great movie. Score = 9.0"
"May 19, 2015",4,"Revenge of the sith is a very good movie, mainly because of Anakin's fall from grace it is so well done and although there are some cringy dialogue, for the most part the dialogue is pretty well done and the action scenes are amazing as well as many other things, Obi-wan is fascinating and we understand why Anakin turns to the dark side, because we all have those that we love very much."
"May 19, 2015",3.5,An improvement but far from a masterpiece as the original trilogy was.
"May 16, 2015",5,"By far the greatest of the prequel trilogy due to its visual wonder, better acting, better direction and well written script that leads straight into the original trilogy make this one of my favorite Star Wars films to date."
"May 15, 2015",3.5,"Episode III, the concluding episode of the first Star Wars trilogy (a.k.a the annoying Anakin trilogy). However, Anikin was slightly less annoying in this movie than it's previous 2 predecessors. 

The pro's of this movie are its lightsaber fights, established characters, the visuals, and it's set up for the next trilogy. I am sure this movie has leverage because it is the movie that sets up the next trilogy, and has that advantage. 

However, the pro's of this movie, are sort of... kind of... also... its con's. Though notably bad were it's at times cringe worthy dialogue and rush sequences. I believe the first 2 movies could have been just one movie, and this movie could have been split to 2 movies. 

In conclusion; Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith is watchable and an okay movie. Sadly okay isn't the caliber of the originals, and probably might not watch it when marathoning Star Wars, though I wouldn't consider it out (like *cough* episode 1 and 2). 7/10"
"May 15, 2015",4.5,One of the best movies of all time
"May 14, 2015",4.5,"George Lucas returns for the final installment in the prequel trilogy, and while it may not be the best film of all time, I enjoyed the film.

      Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars film in my opinion behind Return of the Jedi, the film improves on acting and plot, the development of Darth Vader and of Padme and Annakin. Obi-Wan has amazing dialogue. And I watched the end of the film hundreds of time, it's that good.

       Their are not many things that I didn't like about the film, but I do wish the film would have spent a little more time on Annakin becoming evil, and while the film does explain why he did become evil.
 
      Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a must see for fans of the series and while the film does have a bit of weird moments, it is still a stunning work.

GRADE: 8.9/10"
"May 13, 2015",3.5,62% on my Tomatometer.
"May 10, 2015",3,"While an improvement upon the first two prequels, it is still very much of the same and a very unsatisfying end to a very unsatisfying trilogy. Please make the first good Star Wars since 1983, JJ."
"May 04, 2015",4,"Suitably grim, deeply emotional visually exciting and action packed. Revenge of the Sith brings the prequel trilogy to a brilliant close thanks to George Lucas respecting what he created."
"May 04, 2015",4.5,"The best of the original trilogy.
Ends nicely to tie into Ep IV."
"May 02, 2015",5,"It has flaws, but the darkness and the epicness of this film can be compared to the ones found in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". It takes the best duel in the entire franchise, and a really emotional ending to make this my favourite Star Wars movie, but I recognize it's not the best one."
"May 01, 2015",4,One of the very best films in the Star Wars franchise!!!
"May 01, 2015",5,Amazing it was awesome with Dooku's head sliced of and Anikan turning evil it was very good
"Apr 29, 2015",3.5,"We all knew how it would look like in the end. The travel to make it there is quite amazing and makes some sense. My view is that psychologically the Sith and the Jedi are groups of psychopaths with excessive powers, and always wanting more. In the original series, the power was more difficult to obtain and attain. Miracles were unexpected and loved. Now, they look like the ordinary superhero stuff. Lots of this is made with children in mind, so It shouldn't surprise anyone if I find it puerile at times. I like the bit where someone (Obi-Wan I think) finally mention that the whole thing, including the war, was fomented only to provide more power to the top Sith. With all the power in their hands, peace at last. Nice parallel with war(s) on earth. Fabulous effects but still noise in space!"
"Apr 29, 2015",2.5,"There was so much potential for the final film to the prequel trilogy, but what weighed it down? Lousy storytelling, and bad acting! I can never get past Natalie Portman's cringeworthy line on Mustofar ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart""! Uuuggh! I can't watch this woman anymore, because of this, THIS! I can't look at that face the same way in any other movie! There is still a few things to admire about it though. The effects and fight scenes, and that's it!"
"Apr 26, 2015",5,"One of my favorites. And by that, I mean of all time. Yes, all time. 
A certified fresh rating of 100%
   ""Everything is improved upon the first two Star Wars prequels: The characters, writing, action, CGI, etc. Revenge of the Sith will please die-hard fans of Star Wars."""
"Apr 23, 2015",3,"A vast improvement for this last installment in the prequel trilogy. Enjoyable and entertaining ride. Regardless, this trilogy is a setback, contradicting screenplay and  George Lucas fail to capture the subtlety and emotional epics from the original trilogy."
"Apr 21, 2015",4,"By far the best star wars prequel, but still fails in comparison to the originals."
"Apr 19, 2015",2,Does it get wors than this
"Apr 17, 2015",5,"Honestly, I was impressed. It ranks up there with Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back."
"Apr 14, 2015",3.5,From my blog Foster as Films: https://fosterasfilms.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/foster-as-star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith/
"Apr 11, 2015",2,the best of a rotten barrel of apples.  I found Anakin's descent into darkness rater petulant.  Who near Darth Vadar's origins came from a bratty bitch boy pissed that he didn't get what he wanted.  I now feel Vadar is a bitch.
"Apr 09, 2015",3.5,the only good Star Wars prequel
"Apr 08, 2015",1.5,The effects are nice but effects don't make a story or interesting characters. Action scenes take too long and we already know who will survive as these are prequel movies! Not once did I care if Obi-Wan would survive here because he's in the better Star Wars trilogy. The entire movie is only here to show how Darth Vader came to be and how the Jedi fell as the Empire rose to power.
"Apr 07, 2015",2,the last one finally!! and every bad thing about the first two are here as well the characters and plot holes but I did like the opening battle and that's it.. every thing is to over the top silly so don't check it out.
"Apr 06, 2015",4.5,Favorite in the prequels and the only movie that can hold up to the original trilogy. The only thing holding it back is that dialog.
"Apr 02, 2015",3,"A solid entry into the Star Wars franchise. While I'm still not stoked on some of the actors performances, it does not hinder the results..."
"Apr 02, 2015",3.5,"Yes this is what all the prequels should have been like, definitely in no way a perfect movie but still a pretty solid one."
"Mar 30, 2015",5,"this is the best (or one of the best) star wars movies created beside episodes 1,2,4,5, &amp; 6"
"Mar 23, 2015",4,"Finally, George Lucas has given us a prequel to root for. From the very first shot after the opening credit crawl to the very last shot before the end credits, 'Revenge of the Sith' is an incredible film to watch over and over again."
"Mar 23, 2015",5,"Characterization for Anakin is definitely better, and the path to Darth Vader is a fun one. Ewan McGregor puts on another great performance as Obi-Wan and Ian McDermid's Darth Sideous is a perfect villain. Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a fun, dark, and thrilling Star Wars that puts a fitting end to the prequel trilogy, and holds the best light saber fight yet. 9.5 out of 10 GREAT"
"Mar 20, 2015",4,a lot of people hate this film but  i think its one of the best films in the star wars series great  film
"Mar 18, 2015",3,Good not great. Way better then the second one!
"Mar 15, 2015",3.5,Loved the ending as Vader begins!!
"Mar 15, 2015",4,It was the best movie not from the original trilogy. Cool action and great lead into the 4th movie. 4/5 a must see!
"Mar 13, 2015",4,"While the script and character development is still weak, Revenge of the Sith is and improvement over the last two prequels and with great special effects and an expansion on the story and mythology make it a satisfying way to end the Star Wars Saga."
"Mar 13, 2015",4.5,This is the best of the prequels and my 2nd favorite star wars film. i was the first one i saw in the cinema.
"Mar 11, 2015",4,This is really the only prequel that needed to be made.
"Mar 10, 2015",4,as good as the empire strikes back!
"Mar 10, 2015",5,"Revenge of the sith is literally the perfect example of an ideal star wars movie. Its up there with the original trilogy. After one pretty bad prequel, and a lukewarm prequel this is the one we were waiting for. The first half is kinda light-hearted with some jokes here and there in between great battle scenes but then Anakin betrays Windu and it becomes the darkest entry yet possibly. All the Jedi getting killed, Padme getting choked out by Anakin and the best lightsaber duel yet between Obi-Wan and Anakin which leads to the most dramatic and tragic scene in any Star Wars film. This entry saved the prequels."
"Mar 09, 2015",5,The best of the saga in my opinion.
"Mar 07, 2015",4,Star Wars siempre se a caracterizado por sus efectos visuales pero sin duda esta tercera (o sexta) parte demuestra lo glorioso de ese aspecto. Otra vez los errores de guion se hacen presentes pero sin duda la ultima hora es epica y muy triste.
"Mar 07, 2015",5,"Fucking brilliant. Anakin gives into the dark side &amp; becomes Darth Vader. Enough said. Younglings are killed, Yoda goes into hiding, the Jedi retreat like scared bitches. Brillant!"
"Mar 01, 2015",5,people may bad mouth Mr Lucas but I am not one he stays true to the story of the fall of Anakin and the fall of the Jedi order. also people should see the clone wars if you need any clarification on why the Jedi couldn't see there down fall!!!
"Feb 21, 2015",4,"Easily the best prequel movie, where most of the problems from the previous two films were fixed."
"Feb 10, 2015",3,I think it. was a good movie.  Transformation of An akin Skywalker into Darth Vader I think could have been better. Good battle scenes.
"Feb 09, 2015",4,"Quite exciting, a great way to finish the trilogy."
"Feb 08, 2015",4,"The best of the prequels. And it’s not even close. It’s easy to see that this is the story that Lucas wanted to tell all along. He just had to put two movies before this one. It still has plenty of problems. Anakin and Padme’s romance is cringe worthy once again. Anakin’s turn to the dark side is very sudden. It should’ve been building up over the last two movies, but it just quickly happens in a span of ten minutes. The good far outweighs the bad in this one though. This is where the saga begins for me. Don’t even bother with 1 and 2."
"Feb 06, 2015",3.5,The only one in the 2000s trilogy I thought was semi-bearable.
"Feb 03, 2015",5,This movie was my favorite. Why do people hate? Just because it's a prequel? Wow!
"Feb 02, 2015",2.5,"Even though ""Revenge of the Sith"" is the best prequel, it's still doesn't excuse it from being a boring, nonsensical, disappointing train wreck."
"Feb 01, 2015",3,"The script isn't very good and it feels overblown like the two previous movies, but Episode III is entertaining and visually spectacular and it's easily the best of the prequel trilogy."
"Jan 29, 2015",3,The mythology is pretty sound but the set-up from the previous two was so bad that nothing that happens here is enough to outrun it. Full review later.
"Jan 28, 2015",4,"It sadly still features Hayden Christensen, but it's the best action movie of the whole franchise."
"Jan 25, 2015",5,5 stars because it is Star Wars.
"Jan 23, 2015",4,Great to see the finale that we've all been waiting for but just can never quite capture the magic of the first three.
"Jan 19, 2015",4,"Well I prefer the original trilogy 10,000 times over prequels this is easily the greatest prequel of the Star Wars saga. Even if the acting could've been better."
"Jan 19, 2015",3,Could have been so much more
"Jan 16, 2015",1.5,"Revenge of the Sith is the final prequel film to round off the story of Anakin's fall to the dark side, his transformation into Darth Vader, and the rise of The Empire to the level it holds in A New Hope.  

The story begins with Obi-Wan and Anakin fighting some dudes to rescue Palpatine from General Grievous.  After the fight, Anakin hooks up with Padame who's all ""I'm pregnant"" and he goes from stoked to angry about it in, like, no time at all.  

Anyways, through a series of events, Anakin ends up working for Palpatine, and acting like a shit for the rest of the movie, until the big showdown that leaves him so fucked up he needs a robo-suit and ventilator just to keep doing shit (is that even a spoiler, I mean, everyone should have known that's what was going to happen anyways).  

So how is the film?  In a word, it's shit.  I say this as a huge fan of Star Wars films in general.  The first time I watched this film, I was on mushrooms, and I couldn't tell if what I was seeing was really that bad, or if it was a side effect of my visual hallucinations.  I would find out later that no level of psilocybin inspired hallucination could create a gleaming visual shit feast of this level.  

The amount of CGI found in Episode I and II were magnitudes higher than the original trilogy, but the amount in III is absolutely staggering.  The entire film appears to have been filmed on a green/blue screen sound stage, and I literally mean it appears that way.  The whole movie leads you into the uncanny valley in a way that Zemekis' Beowulf could only dream of.  The result is a bunch of characters moving from CGI location to CGI location, but acting as though they're not entirely sure as to what their surroundings really look like.  I mean, for fuck's sake, would it kill you guys to make a couple of walls and walkways here and there?  

The story is completely absurd.  Dooku is an entirely uninspiring villain, and Grievous is just ridiculous to an extreme that is hard to measure.  It's like they looked at the original trilogy, and decided to give Darth Maul a double ended lightsaber, and you know what?  It actually fucking worked, and was arguably the coolest part of that movie.  Then after the success of that, they decided to up the ante, and give CGI yoda a lightsaber and have him flip around all over the place like a spastic child's action figure.  So for the final movie they decided to have a character with four fucking lightsabers.  Yo dawg, I heard you like lightsabers, so we just made them superfluous to the point of nobody caring anymore.  

TL;DR - 3/10
This is, in my humble opinion, the worst Star Wars film to grace the silver screen.  Hayden's acting seems to have only gotten worse as time went on.  The overuse of CGI.  The uninspired villains.  The feeling that the whole movie was just being made to placate the audience and earn Lucas a shit ton of space bucks.  There are so many things wrong with this film that it's actually a struggle to find positive things to talk about in it.  Many people consider this the high point of the prequel trilogy, but those people are fucking nuts.   The phantom menace is better than this sloppy turd, and half of that movie revolves around the hijinks of a goofy cgi muppet.  Still, at least Phantom had a fucking badass villain, a couple of solid action sequences, and a brand new song that nothing in the rest of the trilogy could touch.  Fuck machete order.  You don't need to watch this movie.   It ruins the mystery of Darth Vader, and turns him into a mopey whiny bitch.  Avoid this one like the midochlorian plague."
"Jan 14, 2015",5,"That movie is really sad. Sad in a good way due to story, plot, animation, visual and special effects."
"Jan 12, 2015",1,This was still pretty fucking awful. Why did they keep making these movies after the Phantom Menace.
"Jan 12, 2015",3,It was alright. Had some fun moments but Anakin is really annoying.
"Jan 09, 2015",3,"The better one out of the prequel 3. That is not saying much. This movie is like how Anakin described sand in the second movie, ""Course and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. "" It was a movie you went to see, because you wanted to see it done. 

You take the word ""Sith"" and you move around some of the letters you will get another word that perfectly describes the movie. 


""Tshi"" which is chinese for ""Disappointed in the cooking of the Duck meat"" -RLM"
"Jan 07, 2015",4.5,"Not perfect, of course, but far and away the best prequel...some of the finest sequences in the saga grace this film. Hayden Christensen is a lot more comfortable playing Anakin and McGregor is perfect as Obi-Wan. It is McDiarmid's emperor, however, who steals the show. Not only does this film make Return of the Jedi better, it allows the prequel trilogy to end on a high note."
"Jan 06, 2015",5,awesome movie in the world
"Jan 02, 2015",2.5,"The best entry in the Star Wars prequels, which doesn't really say much."
"Dec 31, 2014",4,"Review In A Nutshell:

After the initial misfire and average sequel, George Lucas has conjured up a splendid finale of the trilogy. Revenge of the Sith may not pack the spectacle punch that Attack of the Clones was able to bring, but he made up for it with something better; character development. It is here in the end; better late than never, that we see the growth of Anakin Skywalker, showing us his inevitable path of the dark side.

Lucas brings back the previous trilogy's simplistic elements to tell its story; good vs evil, betrayal, revenge, hope. It is through this simplicity that audience members are able to connect with its characters and achieve a sense of balance; appreciating not only its superficial aspects but also the deeper, thematic driven ones also. Lucas' ability to raise the personal stakes of its characters that the audience can finally feel a deep sense of loss by its end; it did not matter that we knew Anakin's fate, it is the dark journey he grows through, being enticed by the temptations that lurks beneath him and slowly losing his sense of virtue and lightness that we identify him as a real human being; we cannot purely hate him for what he has become as we see that there are multiple factors that led him down his path, and Lucas ensures that we are able to see a sense of good in him that would pay off later on in the saga.

Gone are the cheery fun scenes that dominated the first film and portion of the second, taking its content much more seriously. Lucas rarely ever gives us an instance to laugh or smile, and I commend him for doing so, because the series is at its best when it takes its characters and story seriously. Lucas does not need to feed us with visual treats and jaw-dropping battle sequences, the series should be about the raw emotion that drives its character; exploring layers that would help audience gain an understanding. In this film, we see Anakin and Obi-Wan in a light that was barely shone; it tests their relationship that manages to thrill audience both in the climactic duel and the internal drama that drives it.

The film certainly still retains that sense of sentimentalism that lets certain moments feel off, but this is Lucas' only way of making things obvious for the entire audience; there will be those, especially the young ones, who may feel alienated towards subtler executions, but the problem with taking this approach is that it becomes less appealing as one becomes older and wiser. Lucas translates this apparent tones and themes through the performance of its actors and the dialogue they speak; I found Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan to be quite effective but Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker was constantly crossing the threshold of melodrama, sometimes unintentionally causing laughter. Though this has always been a problem in the prequel trilogy, and here it is only more tolerable due to Lucas' darker and serious tone, which cushions the blow and creates a more Shakespearean outlook.

The musical score by John Williams is as great as ever, taking a much darker tone that connects well with Lucas' intentions. His contribution to the series has always been one of the franchise's strengths; something that has stayed with me ever since my first viewing as a child. There is simply nothing like the tune of a Star Wars soundtrack.

Revenge of the Sith is what the prequel trilogy should have been, a story that is taken seriously and given a high level of respect. It manages to deliver in deeper themes and fan-service without any conflict with one another. Why couldn't it have been always like this?"

"Dec 24, 2014",4.5,"George Lucas tells the tale of how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, the epic conclusion of the Prequels Trilogy sees the end of The Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire. Great performances all around. The action is great, the effects are fantastic, easily the best of the prequels. Setting the stage for A New Hope with a darker tone."
"Dec 23, 2014",4,"Containing more action than either of its two predecessors, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is one of the darkest films of not just the prequels, but the entire saga, secondly only to The Empire Strikes back, and is the best Star Wars film since Lucas's crowning achievement from 1980. Despite its flaws, Lucas concludes this trilogy in thrilling fashion, finally bringing to life Anakin Skywalker's transformation from Jedi Knight to one of the most iconic villains in film, and closing with a fitting final shot that promises ""a new hope"" is coming.

Full review at http://silverscreenfanatic.com/2014/12/16/benjamins-stash-50/"
"Dec 22, 2014",4,"Easily the best of the prequels (which wasn't difficult), Revenge of the Sith actually boasts some rather good bits. Hayden Christensen does a decent job at portraying a man twisted by a lust for power, as does McDiarmid, who recaptures the real snarling essence of the Emperor. The visuals are better than in Attack of the Clones and put to better use. The film is certainly an entertaining one."
"Dec 20, 2014",4,A much darker and progressively transformative addition to the Star Wars series!
"Dec 17, 2014",3.5,"Not the best of the Star Wars flicks, but it's decent. Best of the prequel trilogy by far."
"Dec 15, 2014",4,"Good and it looked as it would have no hope because 4,5 and 6 did well george lucas did a good job"
"Dec 15, 2014",3,"An improvement over the poor first two entries, Revenge of the Sith is a darker but surprisingly more fun ride. First of, it starts how every Star Wars movie should start. With a fuckin' awesome aerial fight. Then, it features consistent action ste pieces and a better constructed and simpler story that doesn't get too politicalsilly like the ones before and lastly, it actually has a couple of well pulled emotional punches.

Still, the cringe is still here on all its glory. Tacky dialogue, more awkward romance, even more Hayden Christensen and unnecessary foreshadowing of the older trilogy."
"Dec 14, 2014",5,"This movie was great! Lots of action, non stop fun, I can watch this movie over and over and never get bored. Rating A-"
"Dec 14, 2014",2,Constipated Palpatine anybody?
"Dec 13, 2014",4,"After a string of subpar prequels, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith offers a suitably epic and gratifying return to the galaxy well all know and love."

"Dec 04, 2014",3.5,Still cursed with awful dialogue in places but overall everything else has improved drastically.
"Dec 04, 2014",4,"One the best prequel movies of all time! All actions scenes are incredible. The movie is a DARK story. Not just in tone, but also in cinematography and it works well with the story. Loved how everything leads up to the original trilogy (4, 5, &amp; 6). Obi-Wan and Anakin's interactions are very good. Now it makes us believe that they we're actually friends. Their relationship was far better than the first 2 prequels. Watching Palpatine manipulating Anakin into the dark side was handled very well. The music is very epic. Anakin and Padme's relationship is really intense.
I believe George Lucas wanted to only make this prequel, do to how much of a big improvement it had on the other prequels.
The epic battle between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader was the best out of all Star Wars movies and expanded universe. Not just by great choreography, impressive visuals, but because there was so much emotion in it.
Padme's death was my problem with the movie.
Overall, it's an impressive movie that will be one of the best prequels of all time."
"Dec 01, 2014",2.5,"The best of the lot, mostly for the scene between Anakin and Palpatine."
"Nov 29, 2014",2.5,"The best of the prequels (not saying much). If you can get past the god awful love dialogue between Portman and Christensen, it’s an enjoyable movie."
"Nov 28, 2014",2.5,"It had it's moments, but is overall hard to sit through (for me at least). The script wasn't there, Anakin dies a whiny teenager instead of a hero, and the politics get thrown into the mix. Disappointing to say the least."
"Nov 17, 2014",3,"Another improvement from the other two new Star wars flicks, a much better script that is intense and dark, plus cool CGI effects."
"Nov 16, 2014",1.5,"The acting freaking sucks!
Nuff said"
"Nov 15, 2014",4,"I really liked this one there wasn't the best dialogue, but there was a great soundtrack, great SFX, no JARJAR, shows us some of the original characters and ships, and Darth Vader!!"
"Nov 14, 2014",3,"a deserving end to Anakin's saga, steeped in Star Wars mythos"
"Nov 09, 2014",4.5,The force is strong in this movie!
"Nov 06, 2014",3.5,The emperor brought up some great points in the senate battle between him and Yoda. The Jedi are just a bunch of condescending judgmental pricks. The Sith and Jedi are both evil. Though I did find the movie to have many enjoyable parts and is the only good Star Wars made thus far.
"Nov 01, 2014",4,"A satisfying and suitably epic conclusion to the Star Wars saga. Although my overwhelmingly positive reaction wasn't sustained over multiple viewings, there is enough new territory covered in here to make it one of the franchise's more memorable moments."
"Oct 29, 2014",5,Arguably the best in the entire Star Wars saga with better acting than it is said to have. There's even the return of Chewbacca for original trilogy fans! The great lightsaber battles and the OT nostalgia make this an amazing flick!
"Oct 28, 2014",4,Finally a Star Wars prequel that we could be proud of... Regardless of the cheesy No at the end... This is a good film
"Oct 26, 2014",3.5,"Best of the Prequels
The Phantom Menace pandered too much to children, but laid the groundwork for Attack of the Clones, which was better, but still lacked the substance behind the Original Trilogy. Revenge of the Sith is the middle of the franchise, &amp; much like Empire Strikes Back, is the dark point that means the story can only get lighter. The purpose of the Prequel Trilogy (aside from lining old George's pockets with older Georges) is to explain the tragedy of Darth Vader; to show the days of old that Ben Kenobi told Luke about in A New Hope, before the Empire. Being the central low point of the series means this movie is going to be the darkest, &amp; it totally is. The Republic is destroyed through political shadiness, the Jedi are massacred by their once-loyal clone troopers, &amp; our hero Anakin leads the charge (or the slow, menacing pacing) through it all. ""Oh, but he's only doing what he thinks is right!"" Sure, he's trying to save his wife &amp; unborn child(ren), but since when does a plan like that justify KILLING ALL THE YOUNGLINGS IN THE JEDI TEMPLE?! I understand why that had to happen for the story's sake, but it is totally uncool to show an entire compound of lil baby Jedi corpses. Bad call, Lucas. I could keep going: Good action, more lightsabers, my personal favorite opening sequence from any movie. Also, stiff acting, hit-or-miss acting... Whatever. Good movie.

"Oct 21, 2014",4.5,"Enough puppits, soft talk, boring Jedi fights,  and boring action. 

Good note to end on."
"Oct 19, 2014",3.5,"Revenge of the Sith is the last Star Wars movie so far,that talks about the epic ending of the Jedi order and the cruel beginning of the Empire.Surprisingly dark and very emotional and despite its flaws like the coherency that is lost and the consistency that is jumbled through the movie,Revenge of the Sith is a solid good movie with very convincing performances.Its the prequel we've been waiting for."
"Oct 18, 2014",4,"I get that the other 2 in this prequel trilogy are really bad (still can entertain me though for some scenes). But this one was great. It was what I wanted all along. Granted there is some weak dialogue in this film but it is the best of the 3. It has a clear story, fast paced and though some of the acting is still cringe worthy from Hayden Christensen. There are some moments of his acting that really shine through. Example when he was sent to the Jedi Temple after discovering Palpatine is the sith lord and the ominous music is in the background. Anakin is looking out towards Padme and she looking over at the temple and Anakin is having doubts and second thoughts and you can see the conflict that is great acting and again when he finds out Padme is Pregnant he gives a very good realistic delivery to that scene. The action in this movie is great special effects still look great 10 years on and Ewan McGregor kills it as Obi won and He and Ian McDiarmid give the best performances in the film. It is also really enjoyable to watch and was a fitting end to an other wise bad trilogy. It made me want to watch the others and continue to the originals which is in a sense what a prequel should do. Well done George 3rd time the charm."
"Oct 14, 2014",4.5,"Obviously the best of the prequels, it has the pacing and the tension that the the other 2 sorely lacked and it tied the saga together very nicely, but still, the acting and the dialogue are still off putting. Excellent visuals, awesome battles and enough lightsaber battles make this a must watch"
"Oct 13, 2014",5,The best part by far from the prequels and the 2nd best in the franchise after the Empire strikes back.
"Oct 08, 2014",4.5,"Revenge is a fantastic and epic conclusion to Lucas' great saga due to amazing visual effects, intense action, and surprising elements of interesting mythology."
"Oct 06, 2014",4.5,"The last chapter of the prequels offers an awesome story, worthy of Darth Vader. The whole cast offers great performances, specially Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, fulfilling his destiny becoming Darth Vader, and Ewan McGregor brights as Obi-Wan. This move has even more, but better and needed VFX. It has some continuity mistakes but they pass unnoticed thanks to awesome fight scenes, specially the light saber final fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan. Revenge of the Sith is a worthy bridge to Episode VI: A New Hope and it's probably the best prequel of the Star Wars Saga."
"Oct 05, 2014",4,"As a huge fan of star wars, this one is the best of all the prequels, the most I luv about this movie is the memorable music."
"Oct 04, 2014",4.5,"Best of the prequels. it kills of Hayden (almost), so it does have some credibility"
"Oct 04, 2014",4,"I can see why people hate this film - I really do. But for me, this is the film the previous two prequels should have been. Hayden's acting ability has defiantly stepped up, as has everyone's in this film. From the first shot you see, you can tell the CGI looks 10 times better. A lot of things have improved, and, while it's still cringey at times, the script has too. Anakin's turn is my only issue, as it happens so quickly you can't really believe about how fast it has happened. Regardless, when he has turned, and he is now known as Darth Vader, it is the best scenes of the entire prequels. Order 66 is emotional, the story of Darth Plageius the wise is haunting; it's like Lucas actually wanted this film to appeal to fans of the original trilogy, and for me, it did.

Oh yeah, and General Grievous is the most underrated character in SW - he is badass!"
"Oct 02, 2014",4,Best of the prequels.

With Revenge of the Sith, George Lucas brings the epic Skywalker story to a resonant close, despite the wooden acting and loud, flashy effects that carry over from its predecessors."

"Aug 16, 2014",4,"The conclusion to how it all started. We learn such things as the slightly ""cowardly"" General Grievous being the head of the droid army, discovering the chancellor as the Sith lord, the human clones during the clone war a set-up, and of course Anakin Skywalker becoming the one and only, Vader. I would have to consider this film the best out of the other two prequels. The movie ran along quite nicely, had lots of neat action, scenery and special effects as usual, and it greatly demonstrates how it all happened from the middle of the movie (the Sith lord looking more like himself) to the very end of it (Luke and Leia born and split apart)."
"Aug 15, 2014",2,Satisfying? Maybe compared to its predecessors. EXTREMELY OVERRATED. I like the action though. 2.2
"Aug 15, 2014",4,"Not even close to the original trilogy, but by far the best film of the new one. What makes it very interesting is that it builds a bridge to Episode IV and we finally see how Anakin is led to the Dark side. And the best thing about the movie is that even Christensen's cheesy performance can't harm it."
"Aug 12, 2014",2.5,best if the prequels buy overall not a good movie. Anakin is the cry baby as usual.
"Aug 11, 2014",3.5,"Originally the so-long-song to the star wars film franchise, LucasFilm redeems itself to an extent with this darker tale. Set to build up to A New Hope, Episode III explores the true power of the dark side of the force deeper than any film before it. The movie is still plagued by dull acting but at least the script is ""a little"" better than Episodes I and II. With all of it's flaws, Episode III was surprisingly moving and epic at the same time. The fall of the jedi order is one that you will not soon forget."
"Aug 10, 2014",4,"Definitly the best of the prequels, and it falls a little short from the original trilogy. Very good plot and a satisfactory ending to the prequel trilogy. It gives a very good story on the origins of Darth Vader. The lightsaber battles were more frequent and better. I still recommend the entire prequel trilogy, I enjoyed it. But if you could only watch one from the prequels, I'd choose this one. Very solid movie."
"Aug 06, 2014",3.5,"Grade:High 7/10

Star Wars: Episode III-Revenge of the Sith is the final Star Wars
prequel and one that in my opinion, brings around a fine end to the
modern films too. Some may disagree but compared to the first two which
I actually didn't dislike, Episode III is a good tip top movie and we
really delve into the franchise at a heightened emotional level. With
things such as improved acting, effects and even writing(well
possibly), I couldn't take my eyes off and found the film to be solidly
a good one, and here below is why so.

The story is on an epic scale of fantasy film and we get a massive
movie that culminates brilliantly. It has tense moments but also the
funny parts and for anyone watching it first time, it isn't such an
easy movie to predict. I liked the way it played out and when any
fighting is involved it never seems too long or too short, they get it
done in the right amount of time as so we are not bored by it all. The
ending is a real great ending to set up Episode IV and not to spoil
anything here, but it plays out also real well.

I found that although he doesn't do that well, Hayden Christensen
actually improves a little here and really tries to mix Anakin's
feelings around and it comes off well. Ewan McGregor comes back again
strong and yet again he has a firm hand on his role as Obi Wan, Natalie
Portman finishes off OK and this is as with Christensen, her best film
of the three. It has some great characters in this one and things like
General Grievous may annoy some fans, but I will say he adds a lot of
daunting evil to the pot.

George Lucas puts in a better shift on his last Star Wars film and his
writing is just ever so slightly improved, direction is also done very
well and the fight choreography is done wonderfully as well. I said
about improved effects and it is true, this was made for 2005 and the
effects can seem a bit dated now if we watch but for then they were
great and yet again Star Wars pushed the boundaries of special effects.
The cinematography is beautiful for some too even if it is used on
effects.

The script isn't air tight and has little niggles in there, mostly to
be fair to do with Anakin as he and Padme have very little chemistry.
It could be very much said that the middle part is a bit rushed and
seems as if Lucas is desperate to get to his big ending, the story is
strong but is a bit fast. One last criticism is the acting as a whole,
Anakin in all three has been poorly portrayed to say he is so major and
it's a real disappointment he is hard to connect with.

I feel this one should, and I repeat should bring the Star Wars
originals and prequels to a round circle and finish it off with at
least a bit of style. Some may very much dislike it as it has a few
connections with the originals but not too many to annoy. If you are
new to the series and seen the first two then this will probably make
you feel as if Star Wars only gets better and better as this is massive
improvement.

Overall I give this a high 7/10, it is Solidly a Good movie, I think at times
it is nearly very good and bits are great, but in the end turns just
straight good. George Lucas made them again, brought back the franchise
to the fans and got both acclaim and panning along with them, but I
respect him for doing it and bringing in a whole new generation of
fans. Star Wars has a future but I think even in a while to come,
Episode III will still be a worthy entry."
"Aug 04, 2014",4.5,"I'll own it, this is the best Star Wars movie - better than all the others, period."
"Aug 03, 2014",4,Best out I the 'new' Star Wars movies
"Aug 03, 2014",4,"good send off to the prequels, best of the three. little over dramatic but essential to the continuation of the saga."
"Jul 31, 2014",4.5,The final of the Star Wars Films combines the strong visual effects of the Prequels with the groundbreaking storytelling of the originals.
"Jul 29, 2014",4,Better than the other prequels.
"Jul 28, 2014",4.5,"The story of ""Revenge"" is basically Anakin Skywalker turning to the dark side and embracing his destiny - Darth Vader. However, this film actually belongs to The Emperor, aka Darth Sidious, aka Palpatine. Its Ian Mcdiarmids outstanding performance of Palpatine that is the glue that holds the film together. As Paplatines plot finally falls into place and we understand at last just who The Phantom Menace is, Mcdiarmid totally eats up the screen. From the early scenes where Palpatine subtlely sucks the unsuspecting Anakin into his dastardly plot (look out for a particularly stunning scene between Anakin and Palpatine early in the movie, where Palpatine relays the legend of the tragedy of ""Darth Plagueis The Wise"" to Anakin. This is possibly the best acted scene in ANY of the six movie Saga) through to the hackling, insane and unbelievably evil Emperor literally trashing democracy itself as he battles Yoda in The Senate, this is Mcdiarmids movie and does he rise to the occasion! This is surely the best Star Wars performance since Guiness in Star Wars and Ford in Empire Strikes Back.
However, ALL the acting performances are better in this film. Natalie Portman, Hayden Christenson and Sam Jackson deliver much more solid work than they did in Attack of the Clones. Ewan Mcgregor, if not quite as good as in Clones, is still excellent. The actors clearly relish have more dramatic material to work with, and aside from the occasional poor line here and dodgy acting there, everyones work rises to a better standard in this film.

The film starts with an epic space battle as The Clone Wars reaches its final cresendo. Palpatine has set up his kidnapping and Anakin (now a Jedi Knight) and Obi-Wan Kenobi stage a desperate bid to rescue him from the clutches of Darth Tyrannus (Christopher Lee) and new villain General Grevious. The first twenty minutes is non stop, classic Star Wars action. Look out for the shocking moment when Tyrannus is executed at the hands of Anakin. - This is the first indication of just how dark Revenge of the Sith is.

The film for me really picks up after the opening action when Anakin returns to Coruscant and is reunited with his wife Padme. He finds out he is to be a father and its at this point he begins to have visions of Padmes death - Which takes us back to his mothers death in Attack of the Clones. This sets Anakin on a journey to stop Padme from dying as his mother did. A journey that sees him selling his soul to the devil and desending litterally into hell. For the knowlage to save Padme Anakin must betray his Jedi comrades and become Sith Lord Darth Vader.

The middle of the film, where Anakin makes his choice to turn to the dark side, is where Revenge of the Sith lifts from just being a good Star Wars film to being a great film in its own right. A slient moment of rumination between Anakin and Padme offers one of the most haunting moments in Star Wars history. As Anakin and Padme connect silently across the bustling cityscape on Coruscant, a silent voice wails in pain. The sun sets on the galaxy and on our doomed lovers and Anakin makes his decision.

The rest of the film sees the destruction of the Jedi and Anakins appalling betrayal. A pivitol scene between Anakin, Palpatine (now transformed into the warped Emperor we knew from Return of the Jedi) and Mace Windu is really the key scene to understanding just how deep Anakins betrayal was and that he was given the chance to do the right thing, but made the wrong choice - Leading to the quite shocking death of Mace.

The final part of the movie is where all the loose ends are tied up. From Palpatine becoming Emperor of the Galactic Empire through to the end of the Clone Wars, through to the mythic and long awaited lightsaber fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan against the volcanic, hellish backdrop of Mustafar, through to the birth of Padmes children, Luke and Leia and the death/birth of Padme/Anakin/Darth Vader, Revenge of the Sith delivers in spades.
The shocking irony of Anakin himself making his nightmares come true and lashing out at the woman he turned to the dark side to save takes ""Revenge"" to the level of greek tragedy. Christenson and Portman are stunning in this scene. The way their relationship just disintergrates before our eyes is so well done and seeing Anakins rage and anger is really quite disturbing.
The tragedy continues with Anakins downfall at the hands of his former friend and mentor Obi-Wan. The force with which Ewan Mcgregor delivers his parting words to Anakin are just fantastic and you'll find the immolation of Anakin, even if you know its coming, both shocking and moving. Even though at this point Anakin is throughly evil, you'll still feel, through the music and Mcgregors performance, a great sense of compassion for Anakin plight.

So what about the technical aspects of this film? Firstly Lucas's direction is superb. If he was rusty for Phantom and going somewhat through the motions with Clones, then with Sith he definatly rises to the occasion. This is the film he made the Prequels in order to make. This is the tale he's been waiting 30 years to tell. The how and why Star Wars happened.
Like Lucas and all the actors, John Williams delivers his best Prequel work on this film. Many of his pices of music are by turns operatic and tragic. The music that accompanys Anakin and Padmes silent ruminations, the fall of the Jedi, the disturbing ""Godfatheresque"" moment of Palpatines triumph as Anakin wipes out the remaining Sepratist leaders and the music that accompanys the battle of Anakin/Obi-Wan and Sidious/Yoda are all notable musical highlights. Listen out at the end of the film and during the credits for pieces of music from ""Star Wars"" itself - Hinting at the hope to come and taking the movie full circle.

The special effects, sound effects and costumes are outstanding as ever. Its easy to take ILM's fabulous special effects for granted, but the fact is they produce jaw dropping scene after jaw scene. How/why they never won an Oscare for the Prequels is totally beyond me!
The editing from Roger Barton and Ben Burtt is much improved on Burtts solo edit for Attack of the Clones.

Also greatly improved is the digital camera. Where Attack of the Clones had a some how false and shiny look to it, Revenge of the Sith looks much more gritty and realistic. If you didn't know, you would definatly think this movie has been shot using regular ""film"" cameras, rather than groundbreaking digital cameras.

Revenge of the Sith is a fantastic contrast to The Phantom Menace. If the colour of Phantom is all greens and blues, this film is all blacks and reds. Where Phantom was light, this film is dark. Where Phantom was goofy, this film is mature. There is, very much a sense of despair and desperation about this film and this contrast actually makes The Phantom Menace more interesting, in my opinion. It doesn't negate all the many problems Menace has, but it at least justifys through contrast, the tone that Lucas chose for Epsiode I. Aside from brief chinks of hope with the arrival and splitting up of the twins right at the end of the film, Revenge of the Sith is unremittingly dark. Some scenes, such as the creation of Darth Vader are actually quite disturbing - Hence the 12 certificate.

Along with The Empire Strikes Back, Revenge of the Sith is my personal favourite Star Wars movie. The visual poetry of the final scenes (first dealing with the mother, then the father, then the daughter and finally the son) is just beautiful. As we arrive at the final scene where baby Luke is delivered by Obi-Wan to Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru and the twin suns set over Tatooine, we come full circle and you'll have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the sheer beauty, opera and poetry of it all.

It may not have been a smooth ride, but this film made the Prequels a worthwhile project."

The storyline is more meticulous and intelligently sculpted than any of the other movies in the series. The battles are bigger and better. The universe is more beautiful than ever. The actions being taken feel like they matter and this movie engulfs your senses while you watch it. Lucas learned from his mistakes."

"Jul 16, 2014",4,Best out of prequels by far
"Jul 16, 2014",3.5,"It's the best of the prequels but it's also a solid movie on it's own. The lightsaber battles are actually really good in this one, and it's actually got a few good and interesting villains. I think that the only reason this one gets so much hate is because it's easier to say that all the prequels sucked, instead of all the prequels except for the last one sucked."
"Jul 14, 2014",4,"The high point of the prequel trilogy; still victim to some poor acting, but many dramatic scenes and awesome lightsaber duels mean that 'Episode III' is far more entertaining than its immediate predecessors."
"Jul 11, 2014",1.5,not the best directing
"Jul 09, 2014",4.5,"Probably the third best ""Star Wars"" movie over all. You know what numbers 1 and 2 are."
"Jul 08, 2014",5,My favorite movie of all time!!!
"Jul 08, 2014",5,Emotional and powerful. Expected ending but still continues to shock. Worthy conclusion.
"Jul 07, 2014",3.5,"Clearly the best film in the prequel trilogy. It's the most emotional, most action-packed, and it feels very epic especially in the final climax."
"Jul 06, 2014",2,"Better than the other two prequel movies, but still a mediocre film."
"Jul 06, 2014",4,There's still some annoying scenes and dialogue throughout.  But the darker tone and the ending that explained the Darth Vader we were introduced to in Episode IV ultimately left me satisfied.
"Jul 05, 2014",2.5,It's the best of the last first three but then I've taken dumps that were more entertaining than Phantom and Clones
"Jul 05, 2014",4.5,"For a prequel so devoid of emotion, comedy, reasonable romance and other characteristics found in the originals, Revenge of the Sith is a refreshing conclusion to the failing prequels. Most certainly the best of the last three,  actors like Ewan, an, and even Hayden provide tranquility when needed and fury when demanded. From the fast pace opening to the climactic ending, RotS is almost like an apology for the last two movies, and while still far from perfect, provides interesting lore and a clearer background on the Star Wars universe."
"Jul 04, 2014",4,"One of the best Star Wars films in the whole series. The movie is really excellent, it combines CGI with good characters and a storyline which is hard to forget. As Anakin turns to the dark side, we start to see him behave more like the bad guy that we know from the original movies. Emperor Palpatine is absolutely one of the strongest characters in this whole movie. Yoda and Mace Windu also have really interesting scenes in the movie, which are equally as memorable. This movie does a great job of ending the prequels and entering into the original trilogy."
"Jul 03, 2014",3.5,"Well here it is, the final chapter, the bridge to gap with the Original trilogy, and said to be the best of the series: Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. But in the end of the overpraise the film got, does it hold up better than the other two films? Yeah. Is it a good film? Eh. Is it better than A New Hope or Empire? NOOOO (don't go that far guys.) So as i said before, take the PT reviews with a grain of salt and know that i have grown up with both these trilogies, been there done that, let's move on. So, a re-watch of this film, to complete this autopsy of a trilogy that was the prequels, is what, i have to admit, where Lucas listened to the criticism of the other two films this time, and the results do show this. Anakin's character gets more personality and focus, the effects hold up better with a (sort of) better mix of special effects and practical effects, and Ewan Mcgregor gave a DAMN good performance, and even physical look, of Alec Guinness's Obi-Wan. But......yeah don't take that as a huge compliment, because this is still a flawed, poorly written, and disappointing film. So yeah while the story seems more involving, the acting is better from Hayden, McDiarmid &amp; Ewan, the effects do hold up better, and the opening starts decent on PROPERLY introducing a SW film, the poorly written dialogue, Anakin's sudden and forced turn to the darkside and RUINING Darth Vader's character as a literal child and massacre killing machine, half of the main characters (mainly Obi-Wan and Padme) were not developed as placed as filler, continuity screw up thanks to the poorly made story, and even the Jedi eradication and clones as Stormtroopers were forced and not thought out. So yeah, it may be the better prequel of this series, but it still doesn't excuse ruining the potential this movie could've explored to REALLY connect to the original Star Wars."
"Jul 02, 2014",2,Not bad but the crap
"Jun 29, 2014",3,This is the movie in the prequel trilogy where I can sit down and actually enjoy this movie and be the best in the prequel trilogy
"Jun 28, 2014",4.5,"As we finally encounter the fall of the Republic, the film has a very good ending before the story of Luke Skywalker. Great film, which improves on the 1st and 2nd!"
"Jun 27, 2014",5,may the force be with five star
"Jun 24, 2014",4,"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was the Star Wars film I had seen the least of any of them in my entire life because it was so hard me to watch the Sith execute their revenge, and so I had only seen it three times prior. But it was time to face it as an adult head on.

After a two mixed-quality predecessors, George Lucas finally gets his head into gear with Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and crafts a film more worthy of the Star Wars name than either The Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones.
The central issues with Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith aren't all that much to detract from the actual experience of the film. 
The main issue is that there is still a hell of a lot of talking. The majority of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith takes place as the characters talk all the political aspects of the storyline out in a series of settings. While the scenery is a lot more versatile than it was in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, there is still a surplus of dialogue. And although the script is a serious improvement for George Lucas, it still has quite a few scenes that drone on for quite a while being too talkative for their own good. 
The script has made a serious improvement since Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, but there is no escaping the lacklustre quality of writing in the romantic scenes. The percentage of romance in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith has been decreased by at least 98% since it's predecessor, and it makes room for the superior aspects that make Star Wars films great. But there is still a small quantity of scenes present with poorly sketched romantic moments, using poor dialogue such as this except: 

ANAKIN: You are so beautiful.
PADME: It's only because I'm so in love.
ANAKIN: No it's because I'm so in love with you
PADME: So love has blinded you?

Luckily enough, that is one of the very few moments of cringe worthy dialogue in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. But it still sticks out.
And lastly, one of the most criticised aspects of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is Hayden Christensen's performance. I have mixed feelings about it. He established in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones that he cannot play a romantic well at all, and he reminds us of that within the few romantic moments of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. He is a lot more focused on playing an action hero now which is good because he also established in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones that he does not have a knack for comic timing or breathing depth into the character Anakin Skywalker. The issues with his performance in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith are that he still delivers a lot of lines in a generic manner, and sometimes when he tries to be emotional he is just wooden. And lastly, he does not convey much well at all when he transitions from being Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader. He doesn't give us an understanding of what is going through his mind as he transitions, and he plays the character as two different entities. Yet sometimes when he plays Darth Vader he still goes back to being Anakin Skywalker and says his words without charisma, and that would explain how he scored a second Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor. However, Hayden Christensen's performance is arguably superior to his previous performance in the role. For one thing, he actually embodies the stature of being an action hero/villain this time and puts up a hell of a fight in the action scenes, confidently flailing his lightsaber around and moving quickly without a moment of fear. So Hayden Christensen makes himself a worthy Jedi in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith which should please some people. The other thing is that his performance has some effective moments. While there are times when he tries to be emotional and he just ends up hollow, some of the time he has a seriously dark edge. By that I mean when he plays Darth Vader, a man blinded by the dark side, he capture the role with serious darkness. The stare in his eyes is full of darkness and pure evil, and although enhanced by makeup and visual effects, you can tell that Hayden Christensen is truly taking the role seriously. His performance is a flawed but ambitious effort, and I found that he mostly made up for his lacklustre line delivery with a passion for the action scenes and a shadowing physicality as well as the sense of a truly antagonistic nature. So Hayden Christensen isn't as bad in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith as he could have been.
For the rest of the film, I was thoroughly impressed with Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and would call it an excellent end to the series and an unforgettable science fiction experience.
In terms of writing, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith puts its focus a lot better on the more fun and important aspects of the Star Wars universe than its proceeding two films did. The story plays out many storylines that are full of action and keep the focus of the story on the large scale that the universe covers. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith reveals the relevance to the wider picture by depicting the fate of characters all across the galaxy. And the story has a lot of potential which George Lucas capitalises on by going over all kinds of new territory and science fiction mythology, and he goes into the creation of new planets such as Kasshyk and Utupau among others. The story in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is written with keen detail and introduces many refreshing new elements of storytelling to the universe, and it is full of dark and lurid material. The story in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith has no problems going into dark territory which actually made it a difficult film for me to watch. I was scared to watch Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith as a kid because it depicted the fall of the Jedi order, and many of the images depicted in the film still had a serious emotional effect on me. To simplify it, I cried twice watching Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith this time around because of the story's depiction of both the large scale of people damaged by galactic turmoil and the small scale of the just how of affected people, particularly Obi-Wan Kenobi. And although the script still had some weak moments of dialogue, it was more consistently strong.
And I want to make a side note here and say that Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the first film in the series to attempt to implement in consistent moments of comic relief and succeed. Finally making the decision to reduce Jar Jar Binx's screen presence to a matter of two words, the comic relief is downplayed in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith so that the mood of the film remains serious but as few moments are still funny. The majority of these can be attributed to some of R2D2's moments in the intro scene which is good because it sees a return of screen time to a character relevant to every film in the Star Wars saga. So the dark, lurid tone of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is consistent with the development of the story and does have a few moments of subtle but successful humour, so the general feel and mood of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is terrific, and the fact that it managed to sneak in some good humour was just spot on. It means that the experience is not singularly a dark and shocking one, but all in all it was. Yet I can still look back at Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and say that I enjoyed a good laugh at times.
As a whole, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was a truly dark experience. The general feel of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is consistently powerful in terms of its dramatic effect, and the atmosphere was very thrilling. IT found the right balance between focusing on characters and the big scale of the events which means that it was able to succeed as a science fiction epic and a character focused story at the same time. It is very difficult to have so many characters in single movie and still make a film which breathes insight nearly all of them, yet George Lucas finally realised his full potential as a film director and managed to execute that with Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is a well balanced film which focuses on the correct things that a Star Wars film should, and it manages to keep itself powerfully dramatic and entertaining over a consistent rate for the entirety of its running time.
But when you get right down to it, the simple fact is that Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith features some of the most magnificent and groundbreaking action scenes ever put into a Star Wars movie. I mean the film opens up first thing with a space battle, and from there it transitions into a mix of lightsaber battles, shootouts, chase scenes and more lightsaber battles. The quantity of action in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith hits an all time high, as does the quality because the visual effects peak on a new level of brilliance while the choreography is excellent. Most of the praise has to go to the lightsaber duels because they are just spectacular. The choreography for them is just spectacular, and the actors wield the weapons with serious power. I mean there are plenty of magnificent lightsaber scenes in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, more than I could have expected. And fans will be seriously pleased by the quality of them as well as the quantity. When I think of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, one of the things that always comes to me first is the climactic final battle between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader, because it is the most powerful moment in the film. It is where Darth Vader has reached his most evil and angry point, and the man who trained him as a Jedi is reluctantly forced to try and kill him. The emotional buildup to the scene is excellent, and from there it turns into one of the most unforgettable action moments in film history. Ewan McGregor and Anakin Skywalker go at each other with amazing ferocity and dedication as if they truly want to kill each other, so the emotions in this scene is very powerful, and it capitalises on all of the best technical qualities of the film. Action scenes in movies are rarely as emotionally powerful as the final duel in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and it is one of the most unforgettable moments in Star Wars history. It is amazing and too difficult to actually turn away from, and it gives a good name to the whole movie. All the lightsaber duels in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith are exciting, but the final one is the most powerful in the entire series, and the effect of this one moments is just truly unforgettable.
Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith has many of its other action scenes benefiting from the amazing technical elements that the budget could afford. The visual effect deserve praise especially because they make the entire universe feel flawlessly believable as well as giving exceptional detail and movements to the spaceships and such. The actors blend with the visual effects really well so that during many moments, particularly the action scenes, the film is not excessively reliant on either choreography or visual effects and rather finds a perfect balance. Visually, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is amazing. And the visual effects match, of not exceed, the quality of the production design which stretches out to being a lot more versatile and shows off the many new planets introduced to the story. Everything looks excellent with amazing colour and detail, and the cinematography captures it perfectly enough to constantly maintain the feeling that it is up on an epic scale. It is all edited well to keep things exhilarating, and it makes the pace of everything feel like such a rush, as well as the fact that it features iconic sound effects which are edited amazingly well. 
And the other visual qualities of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith include the astounding quality of the costume designs, and the makeup. One character in particular, the famous General Grievous who is introduced in this entry into the series has an awesome and unforgettable appearance, and the detail in him is just exceptional. Everything in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is visually spectacular, and it is a treat on the ears as well because as well as the great sound effects and timely editing, John Williams returns for one last time to the throne which made him arguably the greatest musical composer in film history and crafts one last amazing musical score. Bringing back many of the old themes from the preceding Star Wars films, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith also introduces some new themes, and none of them are more memorable than the intense battle theme that plays during the unforgettable final duel sequence. It booms in and grabs the emotions of the moments in the film with a powerful tenacity, and it brings the audiences' emotions to the right level one last time. Once again, the musical score proves itself flawless and marks the final entry into John Williams' streak of undeniable success as the composer of the unforgettable music in the Star Wars series.
And the skilful cast in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith manage to give it one last effort and perform very powerfully.
Ewan McGregor manages to step up the quality of his performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi even further for his role in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. In Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith he is elevated to the level of an even more wise Jedi master and a more powerful warrior, and so he has to put more thought into his lines and pack a bigger punch during the action scenes. Suffice to say, he does it. The comic relief that once existed in many of his lines for Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is almost completely absent in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and he stands up and does everything very seriously. Without problem he is a massive success because Ewan McGregor's tense line delivery has a lot of wisdom behind it and gives him the true feeling of a Jedi Master, and while he stays consistently serene in his line delivery but determined in his physical actions as a good Jedi should be, there are some moments where he just blew me away. Particularly, the final scene where he has finished duelling with Darth Vader and cries at the loss of his fallen brother. He was so powerful in his line delivery because his emotions were so tense, and they just brought me to tears. Ewan McGregor also puts up a hell of a fight in the final lightsaber duel. He proved in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace that he had the natural knack for being an action hero, and in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith he expresses that by putting up a hell of a fight. He is determined and stands powerfully on his own two feet in the role which is exceptional. Ewan McGregor gives his best performance to date as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and he cements his status as a hero in the minds of viewers and fans everywhere.
Natalie Portman's performance as Queen Padme Amidala is at its best of the series. Although she does have to deal with a few terrible romantic scenes and the fact that Hayden Christensen can still not create any chemistry with her, her performance is great. She channels the true emotions of the character and brings it to the surface in a performance which is ripe with emotional intensity and absolute tenacity. Natalie Portman's performance in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is a powerful one, and she projects her emotions very well through a tense line delivery and a strong physical projection of emotions.
Ian McDiarmid also steps it up for Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. This time, he gradually develops as a character because he plays Senator Palpatine in an all new way which has him slowly progressing into darker territory more and more and revealing himself as the ultimate Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. He transitions well, and he has a certain level of intense manipulation in the part of Senator Palpatine which makes a powerful transition during his fight scene with Mace Windu. He gets to a point where he is the living embodiment of pure evil, and it is an all new level of darkness. Ian McDiarmid's performance in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is just excellent and he makes a perfect antagonist for the film because he is very threatening and intimidating, both physically and mentally. 
Samuel L. Jackson comes back one last time as Mace Windu in another powerful performance. He has a handful of scenes where he delivers his lines with serious emotional tension and stoicism at the same time, and his general presence provides a sense of wisdom and power to the film. And of course, his execution of the performance is spot on because he puts up a hell of a fight in the action scenes and wields his iconic purple lightsaber like the true warrior that he is. Samuel L. Jackson kicks major ass as Mace Windu one last time, and the firm power of his performance gives Mace Windu the ending that he really deserves.
Matthew Wood's voice acting is also terrific. As well as voicing all of the battle droids and such, this time he voices General Grievous and gives him the iconic uncivilised darkness which makes him such a powerful antagonist. His voice acting matches the appearance of the character perfectly and injects in a grand level of intensity and evil into the part. Matthew Wood makes a great impact doing his voice acting in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and his role as General Grievous is unforgettable due to a mix of his voice acting and the iconic appearance of the character.
Christopher Lee's small return to the role of Count Dooku is also impressive and he puts up one last powerful fight, and Jimmy Smits small effort as Senator Bail Organa is great.

So although it has its weak moments, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is the finest film in the Star Wars prequel trilogy because it returns to everything that made Star Wars films good in the first place, implementing in a lot of versatile action scenes which are of top quality and entertainment value thanks to George Lucas' improved direction and some amazing visual effects. And the script is a lot better, the cast are powerful and the story is so powerfully dramatised that it is impossible for fans not to feel the sadness within the film. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is an unforgettable science fiction spectacle, and it restores balance to the series and the force."
"Jun 24, 2014",3.5,"This movie didn't disappoint, unlike the previous two.  There were a lot of cool things in this movie.  I prefer actual sets and even models to full-blown reliance on CGI, but I have to admit, they nailed it with these effects.

The intro was spectacular, and we're immersed in an all-out space battle with a million things going on.  The mission on the flagship was also well-done in my opinion.  I loved the new look for the clones, which clearly looks like it's evolving into the stormtrooper gear, and how their look varies depending on the environment.  The Utapau battle was exciting and portrayed well and Grievous was wicked cool, but of course he and his four sabers could not beat Obi-Wan's one saber and use of the Force.  That was an unfitting demise for such a cool villain.  After Order 66 is commanded, we are shown a multitude of lush and creative settings in which battles are taking place, and it feels like an epic war.

I didn't care about the last stage of Anakin's transformation because I hate the character, so the entire ending did nothing for me (especially the ""NOOOooOoOo!""), but it's a fantastic popcorn flick that's all about awe-inspiring action."
"Jun 24, 2014",3.5,I don't know how to feel how about HEYDON'TACTAGAINCHRISTENSEN everything else is cool...
"Jun 23, 2014",5,Revenge of the Sith is the best of the Prequels. It proves why the Trilogy is indeed part of the Star Wars saga. It makes me a true fan of Star Wars.
"Jun 22, 2014",0.5,"This (along with the other prequels ) is so shit and pointless someone should make a time machine, and DESTROY THESE FILM."
"Jun 20, 2014",2,"This has a couple of enjoyable scenes, but ultimately sucks.  This movie contradicts so many things stated and implied in the original trilogy, to the point where it can't possibly be cannon.

See redlettermedia's review if you don't believe me."
"Jun 19, 2014",5,"my favorite of the Star Wars series, my only complaint is that anakin didn't get a red lightsaber but there are screensavers on the Internet where he is holding one and I'll give it credit for that"
"Jun 19, 2014",3,My favorite Star Wars prequel movie . Has my favorite character in there and has a awsome battle between yoda and empower palatine . Just that there was to much killing . With the Jedi and the younglings . But a great movie .
"Jun 19, 2014",4,My favorite Star Wars prequel movie !  It has all it needs in there . Just less sad scenes! So sad for the younglings :( . But still a great movie !!
"Jun 16, 2014",2,"Ugh, I mean, It looks okay? Ewan McGregor is wasted and Natalie Portman comes down with a bad case of phoning-it-in-itis."
"Jun 16, 2014",5,Best film in the prequel trilogy.
"Jun 15, 2014",4.5,The only film of the second trilogy worthy to be a Star Wars movie!!
"Jun 15, 2014",5,great and extremely dark movie great emotion
"Jun 15, 2014",4,"This movie is definitely the best of the prequel trilogy with stunning effects and a more darker and intense story. It does seem to be long at some parts and Hayden Christiansen still can't act, but this movie is really fun and has some great moments"
"Jun 14, 2014",3,"""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"" is a fine, and fun movie. I wouldn't call it a good movie, but it is better than ""Episode I"" and ""Episode II."" I still pop it in once in a while, and yeah I point out all the flaws in the film, and trust me, this is an entirely flawed film, and just like the last two Prequel films, I still don't count it as canon, and I advise people to avoid it when doing a ""Star Wars"" marathon. If you're looking for a great ""Star Wars"" movie, this one's not that, but if you just want over 2 hours of dumb fun, this film is certainly the dumb movie you're looking for!"
"Jun 12, 2014",4,"Despite all the negativity surrounding the prequels, Ep III's darker tone and Shakespearean characters combine with stunning visual effects to create a satisfying conclusion to the rise of Darth Vader."
"Jun 10, 2014",3,whine whine whine from anakin
"Jun 10, 2014",3.5,"A little long on the introductions of the characters, this episode drags compared to the others."
"Jun 06, 2014",3.5,Definitely the better of the new trilogy the story made sense to enter episode 4 it had the darkness of the sith  a great way to end this Lucas couldn't have don't it better
"Jun 06, 2014",1.5,"Almost better then episodes I and II but still no good! Bad acting, bad writing and lame CGI yet again destroy what was once a great series!"
"Jun 06, 2014",4,"Okay, now we're getting somewhere.
By far the best of the prequels, rivaling that of Return of the Jedi. The darkest and most mature of the six films, bringing a sense of no one is safe. (Aside for the characters in the Original Trilogy.) We get to see how the Empire is formed, how the Jedi were snuffed out of the galaxy, and how Anakin turns to the Dark Side. We finally get to see a brotherly relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, something that fans had been asking for since the beginning. Anakin is a much more likable character than in the previous films, and his intentions seem relatable. The story is always more interesting when the villain thinks he's doing the right thing and being the hero. The film does a good job in tying up any loose ends and connecting it with the Original Trilogy, even if some things still don't add up.
Overall, the film made sitting through the Prequel Trilogy worth it."
"Jun 06, 2014",2.5,"Revenge of the Sith is completely forgettable, cheesy and worst of all, a shadow of what might have been. It passes for cool visuals, but it isn't as much fun as the other prequels and isn't a shade on the originals."
"Jun 05, 2014",4,"The special effects are gorgeous, and there's a real emotional weight in the film, but still lackluster writing and only slightly better dialogue keep the film from achieving the quality of the original trilogy."
"Jun 05, 2014",2.5,Best of the prequels...For whatever that's worth.
"Jun 04, 2014",5,"This film finally lived up to the expectations of The Empire Strikes Back and the original with a solid story and good action scenes. Hayden Christiansen was a good choice for Anakin, it was Lucas' directing that screwed up the acting and dialogue."
"Jun 02, 2014",3,"It's the best prequel but that's not saying very much as the previous two are lazy dogshit cash ins. But it's not a big improvement over them, the dialogue is still awful and there is still too much CGI and god-damn blue screen."
"Jun 01, 2014",4.5,Best film of the prequel trilogy and a great way to end it.
"May 28, 2014",4,"After one bad movie, and one ok movie, George Lucas finally made a real ""Star Wars"" movie! Pretty much all the bad stuff from the previous two is not in this one! Instead, we get more action, much better acting, and all the tie-ins to the original trilogy! Great movie!"
"May 26, 2014",5,"My favorite in the whole Star Wars saga. It's dark, fun, has lots of action, general grievous, and improved acting from Hayden Christensen. Ewan McGregor does great again."
"May 24, 2014",4.5,"Maybe it's because the previous movies were so terrible, but I'm surprised this was actually written and directed by Lucas. Engaging and emotional this one ranks right up there with Empire and Jedi. 9 / 10"
"May 24, 2014",3,"A big improvement over the first two episodes (it actually becomes clear that this is from the same George Lucas who directed the 1977 original), but Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are still delivering those awful lines with laughable attempts at emotion. The biggest sin of this movie is that Christensen brings all of his campiness and immaturity into the uniform of cinema's most illustrious villain."
"May 22, 2014",4,my favorite of all bc it has the most violence but had a few thing i didnt like
"May 19, 2014",4,This was the best star wars movie I have seen it was awesome I loved Grievous and the acting was really good!
"May 17, 2014",1,A heinous crime to all that is stat wars.
"May 17, 2014",4.5,"It's a good film, but the visuals have not aged well"
"May 16, 2014",3,"Does not pay off for the amount of build up we've been given over 30 years of teasing.
ROTS plays like I would have expected it to, as much as I consider this to be my favourite of this trilogy of films, it is only marginally better than the second one.
And that's the problem here, while we see things that are supposed to be epic and shocking, there's literally no build up to it.
No chances are taken here, we don't see the true horrors of what the Clone Wars have done to the Republic in the 3 years of an all-out Interstellar war, with hundreds of battlefields falling into enemy hands on both sides repeatedly, possibly billions of casualties coming from what is more than likely a conscription service being in order in the Republic now, there's no change of Coruscant from the previous two movies, there's no military presence on the streets incase of separatist attack, there's no feel that people are genuinely scared.
It's just another day in the Republic, while 150,000 miles above your head a great space battle raged where the Republic troops were in a life and death struggle to stop their central world from being overthrown AND their supreme chancellor had been kidnapped somehow.
It doesn't fit. And as soon as that opening was over with, there was barely any mention of the War, the thing that has been raging for 3 years.
I'll address the fall of Anakin here, and how it just doesn't fit with established Star Wars mythos.
Lets say you and your partner find out that you're going to have a baby, lets also assume that you live in a world where a machine exists that can tell you during the first 20 days of conception whether or not the mother is in great danger of life threatening Preeclampsia, do you roll the dice and bet the life of the person you're in love with rather than abort until sounder tests and judgement can rule out? Because it's stated in the canon of the movies that some Jedi can see the future and Anakin has seen the future with his Mothers' death, it's established that he's strong enough with the Force to see into the future and he's seen Padme die during childbirth. There is more than enough evidence here to state that it's dangerous to continue with the pregnancy, but if the time scale is too far along, you are not stating that both would rather keep secret the fact that she is the wife of a Jedi and carrying his child and risk her life, than to go to a doctor and state ""this has to stay between us, but I need constant medical attention from now until  I give birth, I don't need stress and the Jedi cannot find out this man is the Father."" It clears everything up in an easy and tidy package  to stop a forced and contrived idea to make Anakin fall.
As for the fall, I don't get that either, I see what Lucas is going for again, putting on blinders and staring at the goal without thought to whats left and right. It's supposed to be tragic, but it quickly becomes pathetic as we don't see a gradual transformation from ""I just helped kill Master Windu, but I have to keep going...for Padme and the baby"" to ""I have the power to control the universe now, I don't need anyone else!"", a sort of sliding scale between the two to show how even after taking that initial step into darkness for the right reasons, the next is done with less reason and the next after that with even less until it becomes more about gaining the power than gaining the power to save the woman he loves. To see at the end what a monster Anakin has become as he is the one who causes the love of his life's death and he doesn't care at that moment, as it's about making an example and showing his ""power"". That would have made a good fall from grace, not the implied murder of children, because we've never seen Anakin interact with children before that scene, with his shock at the pregnancy, he could be the whole ""I don't like kids"" person. 
It's forced for the audience and it's annoying.
And the horribly overdone ""I hate you"" and ""No!"" scenes from Vader at the end of the movie make some of the worst things I could ever have seen.
I don't need to go into the ""No!"" because it's been done to death, but the ""I hate you"" seems to have slipped under the door somewhat.
It's supposed to be a reference to what Yoda states about Anakin in TPM, ""I sense much fear in you"" (Fear&gt;Anger&gt;Hate&gt;Suffering), but like with his fall, it's a spur of the moment thing that hasn't been given enough gravitas to mean anything more than just more pointless whining from a spoilt kid not getting his way. It leads back to the problems between Obi-Wann and Anakin in AOTC, they already have an adversarial relationship that could easily lead to hatred without much prodding. Having them be best of friends and ""brothers"" in episode 2 could have lead to showing how distant they've become in ROTS and how they are arguing on things, sometimes heatedly, which could work into Anakin's fall during the ""necessary"" steps he takes until, even the hint that Obi-Wann not agreeing with him causes an outburst. That then leading to an eventual ""I hate you!"" from Anakin, before he gets julienned, something along the lines of ""You always showed contempt for my ideas, for my abilities, jealous of your padawan since the moment you took him on, always holding him back because you feared being outshined. I could have been given the rank of Master six years ago if it weren't for you."" ""I only did what I thought was right, Anakin."" ""And that's why I'll always hate you, 'my master'. You caused all of this with your arrogance."" Etc, infinitum. Having a cold and collected statement of hatred hurts more because it's coming from someone you love and they aren't showing anything to you, they hate you that much. Rage is passionate and fiery. Cold is bitter and deep.

Finally get to finish with the sound and VFX bit in these movies.
Part three has the worst of the lot and you'll all already know what I mean.
That god-dammed yapping lizard that Obi-Wann was riding against Grievous, again the sound is lifted higher than necessary and again even on a TV it's cringe-inducing. This time though I'm not giving any quarter.
There's no reason a humanoid sized person would ever domesticate a creature than could pierce eardrums, it's there purely for ""Ooh, it's freaky alien stuff, lets make it sound weird"", my evidence for that is easy, stand behind the chainlink fence as a 747 takes off, that's a loud thing to hear. Try getting closer, even as they're warming the engines up and just think how loud it gets, there's a reason why airport staff outside wear those noise cancelling headphones.
Final note to touch on that again I've seen no-one ever comment on other than to point out how stupid it was that it took 18 years for the first Death Star to be built but less than 4 to build the second.
While a contrived movie, Contact explained it very well. Build 2 for half the cost.
Do you really think that Palpatine would allow a Planet destroying weapon to be a single and solitary one in the whole Galaxy? No. He would want one that was better, stronger and more powerful for himself in case any of his subordinates(Vader) decided to blow up Coruscant.
Episode 3 has a lot of problems with it, again they are mostly in the writing and cast choices, cameos and call backs. Doing that for some of the things you want to see in the next movie is a good thing, doing it for two thirds of the movie is not.
Same with the other two, won't watch unless marathoning."
"May 16, 2014",3,The symbolism is strong with this one.
"May 15, 2014",5,Very awesum movie.......will treasure it forever. ...
"May 15, 2014",5,No question the best of the prequel trilogy!
"May 14, 2014",0.5,It's a really bad movie.  The half star is for the light saber fight.
"May 13, 2014",4,"The best of the Star Wars prequels. This dark turn for the Star Wars franchise was really fascinating to watch. Hayden Christensen is still a mistake, but his interplay with Ewan McGregor is certainly much more interesting this time around. Strong direction, phenomenal visuals, especially for 2005, great cinematography, and much better writing than any of the other prequels. A genuinely great movie."
"May 13, 2014",4.5,Awesommmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeee.............
"May 12, 2014",4.5,"Not only is this the Star Wars story we have all been waiting for, it is an improvement from the last two prequels. The cgi improved, the dialogue is better but it gets wooden at moments. Hayden Christensen slightly improved but his acting is still corny. All in all this is the best film from the prequel sage."
"May 12, 2014",4,"While by far my favorite of the sequels it is also the hardest to watch, all the death and betrayal is a choir to watch but the story, acting and effects are amazing."
"May 11, 2014",3,"This is the best in the latest trilogy. Out of all of them this one resembles the original trilogy the most. The ships and sets are all much more familiar then the other two movies. The storyline is also a lot more interesting to follow. 
    The second half of the picture is very well done skipping back and forth from what's going on with Anakin the Emperor and Obi Wan. It explains everything you need to know about the Emperors deformed appearance and the formation of the Empire. Hayden Christiansen also upped his game a lot from Attack of the Clones. The film wraps up every loose end tying in nicely with a New Hope. The lack of Jar Jar Binks was also a massive positive adding much more credibility to the movie. 
      Yet in my mind it's still not Star Wars. The originals had brilliant sets and excellent dogfights in space. There's far too much CGI in the prequels. In my opinion they all needed a serious rewrite. The basic story is there but it needed a lot more work. There's no comedy element at all and the dialogue is terrible in most scenes. Ian McDiarmid is the only real strong performance in this movie. He plays the emperor perfectly and he's on top form in this one."
"May 10, 2014",3.5,"Once again George Lucas writes a terrible script.  Thankfully this film sticks most to what this franchise is good at.  Spectacular visuals.  Also, the score compliments the tone of this film so well, and a few scenes in particular are quite well done.  By playing to it's strengths, Revenge of the Smith largely succeeds."
"May 10, 2014",1,"Visually interesting sometimes, but it still has so much I fear I'll get a brain aneurism. The acting is still bad as well as there being no plot whatsoever, only a series of unfortunate events. And it further rapes the old trilogy and scares me with these new Jedi rules of no love or attachment or emotion--they are the good guys right?"
"May 06, 2014",5,Christianson's finest hour!
"May 05, 2014",4,It took a bit but Lucas finally got a good prequel out of revenge of the sith. The action is exhilarating and the cgi is amazing. Not as good as the original two Star Wars films but I'd say its the third best. Yes I find it slightly better than return of the Jedi. Plus that final lightsaber battle between anakin and obi wan was just plan awesome. Now I really want my own lightsaber.
"May 04, 2014",4.5,"Underrated movie. Not worth all the harsh criticism from so called fan boy. Some dialogue was bad, yes, but that's the norm in Hollywood these days. Story was solid and FX were great"
"May 04, 2014",4,"Easily the best of the prequels, and the only one of the three to deserve its place among the original trilogy."
"May 03, 2014",3,"The best of the prequels, but it still has it's flaws."
"May 03, 2014",4,Great Episode 3 for ages 12+
"May 01, 2014",3,"Awesome schlock abounds in this superior entry to the prequel trilogy, with blissfully fun scenery-chewing from Ian McDiarmid and a finale that will knock your socks off. Probably-unintended fits of laughter only add to the enjoyment."
"Apr 29, 2014",4,final fighting scene makes up for everything.
"Apr 29, 2014",2.5,"The more I watch the new trilogy (and it isn't often at all), the more I appreciate the power of the old one. I can only stomach Revenge of the Sith and its atrocious dialogue, for example, because I know it links up to a New Hope, showcases Anakin Skywalker's transformation into Darth Vader, and sets the stage for the cast of characters that we really care about. If it weren't for the strength of the established trilogy, would anyone really care about these characters and their yapping? Not me."
"Apr 29, 2014",3,A good way to end a very cringe worthy prequel-trilogy. 10x better than phantom menace and attack of the clones... but still pretty bad compared to the original trilogy.
"Apr 29, 2014",5,Best one in my opinion
"Apr 29, 2014",4.5,"The most expensive, epic-looking Star Wars film to date. 'Revenge of the Sith' is a compelling space opera woven together with compelling performances, brilliant action scenes and outstanding special effects."
"Apr 27, 2014",4.5,if you like sifi your gonna like it.
"Apr 27, 2014",1.5,The least bad of the terrible prequels.
"Apr 23, 2014",3,"Well... Best of the three prequels... but the damage has long been done by this point. Also, more creative scene wipes in this one! Yeah!!!"
"Apr 22, 2014",4,"Revenge of the Sith is a great conclusion to the series, but also works as an independent movie. Lucas is a genius here, and it shows. A thing of admiration it is."
"Apr 19, 2014",5,My favorite of the prequels
"Apr 16, 2014",4.5,"A far superior film to the first 2, here all the pieces come together;  all the answers to the questions we had. We saw how everything came to be here. The story is good, the effects are good,  and it was excellent to see how anakin truly became who he was. The transformation was well worth the wait.  There are some phenomenal battle scenes here,  and the fact the 2 biggest one happen simultaneously is very cool. This movie was a fitting pay off to the second star wars triology."
"Apr 15, 2014",4,"At least Jar-Jar was only in it for less then 2 seconds, that gets a half ah star just for that."
"Apr 14, 2014",4.5,"Easily the best of the three prequels, The Revenge of the Sith is an epic finale to one of the most iconic film franchises of all time. With fantastic CGI, stunning visuals and spellbinding action scenes, The Revenge of the Sith may well be the only prequel that lives up to the standards of the originals. Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor produce very good performances alongside Ian McDiarmid who, for me, was an amazing Darth Sidious. The storyline is near perfect and delves really deep into the mythology of the Jedi Religion and shows that love is stronger than all other emotions. The film sets up for a finale of epic proportions, that brings a perfect end to the Anakin Skywalker story. Lets hope the next Star Wars films emulate the high standards set by The Revenge of the Sith."
"Apr 12, 2014",2,"This movie, has paper thin characters who are painfully unaware of the obvious plot in place by the comicly bad villain. Basically its boring to watch pretty pictures if I have no idea whats going on or why they are doing anything that they do. The best that can be said is its better than the first 2 at least."
"Apr 10, 2014",5,"I literally watched all the star wars movies, and this was my favorite. By far the best of the prequels and really helps tie the series separate trilogies together. The film has amazing battle sequences and by far the best video quality of all the new Star Wars masters. A great film that adds to the Star Wars mythology and truly brings the series full circle. While all the films pull you into the Galaxy far, far away this film really draws you in and establishes many of the series distinctions traits. Highly recommended, of course you should watch the Complete Saga in order to get the most from each separate film, but Lucas originally intended for the saga to be seen in the chronological order of it's films so it would tell one continuous story."
"Apr 08, 2014",5,"Revenge of the Sith has its problems, but as Rotten Tomatoes says, the sheer power of the mythology elevates it to the stardom of the original trilogy."
"Apr 07, 2014",3.5,"A great movie. Unlike Episodes 1 &amp; 2 it has a good story, and likable characters. Anakin isn't annoying, and shows us the fall of Anakin better than episode 2. The special effects are great, and fun to watch. All in all a solid movie."
"Apr 03, 2014",3,"Albeit not even close to the sheer level of greatness carried by Episodes IV-VI, Episode III is still better than the previous two installments of the series."
"Apr 03, 2014",4.5,"While the film suffers from crappy dialogue and a mediocre performance from Hayden Christensen, the story is undoubtedly the best in the prequel saga and the exciting action scenes would be sure to get you on the edge of your seat."
"Apr 03, 2014",1,"Grade: D- (22%)
2/10 - Awful"
"Mar 29, 2014",4,"Revenge of the Sith is a spectacular conclusion to an otherwise lackluster prequel trilogy with thrilling and awe-inspiring battle sequences powered by jaw dropping digital effects and an exciting story epic in scale and scope that fleshes out the mythology of Star Wars. Hayden Christensen's histrionic performance as the Vader-to-be Anakin does, however, ruin the film's more melodramatic character moments."
"Mar 28, 2014",4,The Star Wars that leads up to the original classics is thankfully the best of the new trilogy.
"Mar 27, 2014",3.5,"Rousing, riveting, and achingly tragic, Revenge of the Sith is by far the most well-made Star Wars prequel and is the only one that reaches the heights of the original trilogy. Its searing third act is possibly the the most emotional 45 minutes in the entire series. Unfortunately, its premise still disappoints: the fall from grace is rushed and lacks gravitas. Revenge of the Sith is excellent, but one must think of the opportunity cost: George Lucas could have made a masterpiece, but he settled for something merely good."
"Mar 27, 2014",3.5,"If you are going to see the Star Wars saga then start with the prequels and at least you will end with a good movie. Revenge of the Sith has left a bitter taste in my mouth compared to any of the other movies even Attack Of The Clones (2002) Anakin of course will turn to the dark side in this movie starting the story of Darth Vader, but Lucas has come up with the stupidest reason for "" The Chosen One's"" demise to the dark side. Because of a bad dream. Ugh, and it there isn't enough detail. its all action and fighting, yes it may be attractive to a child and even some teens, but a little more detail would have gone along way."

"Mar 21, 2014",4.5,"As a movie more true to the original trilogy, this third installment in the prequel trilogy is stronger than its two predecessors by a mile.  Darker and more mature, this story seems to focus more on the true tragedy of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the two main characters of the prequels, and less on trying to be technologically amazing, although it does look spectacular.  The result is a more character driven story with a surprisingly solid Hayden Christensen and a spectacular Ewan McGregor playing Anakin and Obi-Wan, respectively.  This movie, while not on the level as Empire and New Hope, is, I believe, as good as or better than Return of the Jedi.  The action is good, the story has purpose, and the characters are likable.  The Force is certainly strong with this one."

"Mar 12, 2014",5,"The fall of Anakin Skywalker is great. The duel on Mustafar of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi, and Palpatine vs Yoda. This movie is Star Wars at it's best. Everyone is at their best on this final prequel.

Is interesting how much this movie precedes the class struggles of films like Joker and Parasite (even if to a degree those show it more clear).

My only complaint is I sorts wish Padmé had kept doing things on the Senate other than being pregnant. Wish an extended cut would release with the scenes where she and Bail Organa organize the First Rebel Alliance meeting."
"Mar 08, 2014",5,The best and latest Star Wars film.

"Mar 04, 2014",4.5,"""So this is how liberty dies.... with thunderous applause.""

There's been quite a bit of division on the Star Wars prequels; to some it's a disgrace to the greatness of the original trilogy, while others like myself enjoy them for what they are. As for the final prequel, Revenge of the Sith, the film that ties the complete franchise together, definitely saves the best prequel for last, and George Lucas has finally made a Star Wars prequel that matches the greatness of the original trilogy.

The Clone Wars are going on, and the Republic is in complete chaos. Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) have defeated Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), but the Sith is still strong thanks to droid leader Grievous, and Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) seems to have too much power for executive rule. While this turmoil is going on, Anakin starts to face moral decline, as his secret wife Padme (Natalie Portman) is pregnant and has nightmares of her dying in childbirth, and faces distrust from the Jedi Council, particularly Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), for befriending Palpatine too much. When it's revealed that Palpatine truly is the Sith Lord the Jedi was looking for, Anakin, torn by his distrust for the Jedi and his mentor, becomes Palpatine's mentor in the Dark Side, and begins his first steps as the ruthless Darth Vader, thus culminating in the extinction of the Jedi and the birth of the Galactic Empire.

While I enjoyed watching both The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, the films were plagued with flaws in Lucas's storytelling, considering their excellent visuals, and lacked what made the original trilogy some of the greatest films ever made. With Revenge of the Sith, Lucas finally makes a prequel modern masterpiece. Though we know what happens to everyone in the end, the way Lucas presents Anakin's turn to the Dark Side is so grand, so tragic, and so moving that you're still shocked at what's happening, especially in the scenes where he attacks all the Jedi.

I have to give special praise for Hayden Christensen, who finally does a great job at playing Anakin after the horrific performance he made in Attack of the Clones. It turns out... he just needed to be evil to actually act. Though some of his dialogue is still a little awkward (especially when he says, ""If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.""), I can forgive the occasional off moments and finally respect Hayden for doing a good job.

This doesn't sound surprising, but like the rest of the films, the visuals are outstanding, with Revenge being the best-looking visually in the prequels, best of which being the grim designs of the planet Mustafar where Anakin and Obi-Wan engage in an epic lightsaber duel. And speaking of that duel, after over 25 years of a really awesome duel scene, this one is the one to really awe at. Hayden and Ewan did the entire stuntwork, and their choreography is so good that it looks like it's done by true professionals. It's the best lightsaber battle in the whole saga, and with new Star Wars films in production, and more advanced technology, I'm excited for more epic lightsaber duels. Also noteworthy is a great battle between Yoda and the Emperor and Obi-Wan's battle with General Grievous.

And like with what Hayden does in his role, everyone involved in Revenge of the Sith showcase their best acting in this film. Ewan McGregor improves with each film, acting more like Alec Guinness in the originals and less like himself. He shines best where he confronts Anakin on Mustafar. Natalie Portman shows more true acting and less eye candy here as Padme, likely because her character is pregnant and has hardly any action scenes, but that's OK. If I want to see the action Natalie, I'll watch Attack of the Clones. Ian McDiarmid gives a performance that made him so great in Return of the Jedi, showcasing his sinister evilness and greatness that made Palpatine such a menacing character. Really love the scene where he receives the scars that made him The Emperor. And Samuel L. Jackson, like most of his roles, continues to show awesomeness even when you know he's only there for a bog paycheck, and has a great fight scene before his character's death. There's also great appearances from R2-D2, C-3PO (though in more of a cameo appearance than other Star Wars films), Chewbacca, Yoda, and the best part??? Jar Jar Binks only says a single line, and is only seen for at least two seconds. The less Jar Jar, the better the film.

And John Williams is back to score the film, and like with just about every film he's involved in, does a truly amazing job at making spectacular music. I love how he uses the previous themes in previous films and combines them into one film to create a truly unforgettable experience, and that what Williams does best, particularly in the awesome ""Battle of the Heroes.""

Revenge of the Sith is easily the best of the Star Wars prequels. The story is more compelling and character-driven, creating a vastly dark and moving experience like The Empire Strikes Back, the acting is as strong as the original films, the visuals are digital technology at its finest, and the best part??? Jar Jar is rarely seen! Though the original trilogy is still the best of Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith is still a great blockbuster on its own. And I'm completely confident that JJ Abrams can match the greatness George Lucas mastered in the original Star Wars trilogy in 2015.

""You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them! Bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness! You were my brother Anakin! I loved you!"""
"Mar 03, 2014",3,"Spoilers

For me Revenge of the Sith is a really nostalgic movie. I don't know why but I used to watch this film a lot when I was younger. Revenge of the Sith is without a doubt the most polarizing of the Star Wars movies. Some people hate this film, some think it's okay and some love it. I think that while it's an okay movie it's definitely the best of the prequel trilogy. The acting in this film is a lot better than the previous two. Hayden Christensen is a lot better in this film. He's not great and he still reads some of lines terribly like at the end with Obi-Wan but he's still decent. Ewan McGregor is amazing in this movie. He gives a very likeable peformance. But I love how he gives a more emotional peformance, his line where he yells at the evil Anakin how much he cared about him is so powerful and it's great to see an actor put some emotion in his peformance. Natalie Portman isn't in the film that much but she's alright but I hate how Padme dies of a broken heart, that's so bad. Ian McDiarmid is so great, he's unbelievably over the top and hammy, he does this weird voice that's really funny and the scene where he electrocutes Mace Windu is quite a violent scene but I found it a bit unintentionally funny because of how hammy Ian McDiarmid is. Samuel L Jackson is incredibly boring and monotone in this film but he has an unbelievably over the top death. Frank Oz is great as Yoda, speaking of which I thought Yoda was a lot better in this movie. George Lucas while he still doesn't do an amazing job at directing this film did a better job than with the previous two. While the dialogue in this film is still a bit clunky and dull it's again a lot better than the other two. Now while this film is still a lot lot better than Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones it's still a mixed bag and has a lot of problems. The action is fairly mixed and I think that there is an overuse of the lightsaber. The fight between Obi-Wan, Anakin and Count Dooku is a lot better than the one in Attack of the Clones and while it's very short I love the bit when Anakin's anger gets the better of him and the Emporer godes him into quite brutally beheading Count Dooku. The Obi-Wan vs General Grevious fight is actually pretty awful. General Grevious is a really bad and useless villain, he does literally nothing and considering he has four arms and fights with four lightsabers you would expect an amazing and intense action scene as Obi-Wan has to act on his feet and figure out how to defeat Grevious, but no the fight is over in about a minute as Obi-Wan just cuts off two of his hands and then force pushes him away. It's very underwhelming and there is literally no point in General Grevious being in the film. The Mace Windu vs the Emporer fight is very underwhelming as it's very short and while it's clear Samuel L Jackson knows how to do the physical fighting, Ian McDiarmid obviously has no clue what he's doing although as I said the scene does have a very over the top death. The Yoda vs Emporer fight I have always loved, I like how Yoda does less flipping around and while it starts as a lightsaber fight it ends as a battle of the force which is great. Ian McDiarmid is again very hammy in this scene. The Anakin vs Obi-Wan fight is very emotionally driven and has great music and some great moments, although it's very overly coreographed and overlong but it has some great moments and I love, love the ending where Obi-Wan chops Anakin's legs off and screams at him as he burns. Although I still don't understand how the fight is over when Obi-Wan jumps on a hill as he has the high ground, even though in Phantom Menace Darth Maul had the high ground and Obi-Wan won the fight. Overall the action is fairly mixed although when it's good, it's really good. This film has some great moments in it. I adore the opening. The film opens with an amazing flying scene which starts with a unbroken take, although the scene with the buzz droids is a bit pointless. The best scene in this movie is the opera scene with Anakin and Palpatine, it's a brilliant scene and it's very good to see the Emporer tempting Anakin towards the dark side. My personal favourite scene in the whole movie however is the order 66 scene, it's very powerful and brutal, but it's also a scene that is made for everyone. If you liked these Jedi watch a powerful scene of them all getting killed, but if you hated these characters watch them all get killed. The John Williams score is amazing, it's the best of the trilogy and very powerful. The cgi is also a lot better, there's still a couple of bad effects but for the most part looks a lot better. There's also a practical set from the first Star Wars movie which is great. The cinematography is again excellent, but to be fair every Star Wars movie has great cinematography. However there are problems, like an over reliance on cgi, clunky dialogue, yet luckily Jar Jar Binks has no lines. One of the worst things about the movie is the handling of Darth Vader and Anakin. Anakin's turn to the dark side is very sudden, he chops off Mace Windu's hand, feels about a second of regret then suddenly he's evil. Then he gets operated on after losing body parts and getting set on fire, which is a great scene by the way, then he becomes Darth Vader and does his stupid, unintentionally funny 'nooooooooo' line then he watches the Death Star get made and that's it. Considering this film was heavily marketing Anakin becoming Darth Vader, it's a huge shame Vader is barely in the film. Also as I said before Padme dies
of a broken heart which is so stupid, I feel like George Lucas needed her to die immediately after childbirth so he just quickly thought up she would die of a broken heart. Also this film does drag in places and while I do love the whole opening action set piece it's a bit overlong, I remember checking how far in the film was and it was 20 minutes! Also some of the blue screen is a bit shoddy at time. Also a huge problem I have is Anakin doesn't really feel evil, he feels more like a bully. Think about it, he doesn't murder a single Jedi, he murders younglings but that's it.
I think it would have been so effective if maybe Anakin had murdered a couple of the jedi as we could see the pain of killing the Jedi yet the satisfaction of killing the people who denied him to become a master. That would have been powerful and amazing. Overall you can nit pick this film to death, there's a lot of problems but at the end of the day Revenge of the Sith is a fairly fun, emotional and quite entertaining movie. It's not perfect but it has some excellent acting from Ewan McGergor, fantastic music and really good action. It's flawed but the best of the prequel trilogy.

Then came time for the third one. And at this point you felt like a battered housewife who keeps returning to an abusive husband...It's like going to your daughter's graduation: YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA SUCK! But you just wanna get it over with. -Plinkett.

Sith is not very well scripted and not nearly as well acted, but at least these problems are partly overcome by the thick plot that should have taken place in the previous movies. In fact, the whole plot of EPIII should have been the main focus of the whole trilogy. While it isn't particularly great, it's substantially better than the previous installments, containing more of what made Star Wars so much fun. Sure, you can say that the main character of the movie is CGI, but once you realize that what you're watching is canon, once you realize that this is Star Wars--this is Lucas's vision--you can do nothing more than sit back and perceive it. It's campy, it's dumb, it's rushed and incoherent in its character development, but Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is something of a treasure."

"Jan 25, 2014",5,"Very cool Star Wars movie. May be my favourite. Hayden Christensen is a much better actor in this one and his transformation from Anakin to Darth Vader is very cool too. Not cool as in being a good thing, but just cool as in the way it happens and his acting. Looks very, very cool on Blu-ray as well. Not nearly as much politic stuff as the first two movies which made it much more exciting and nothing that could cause you boredom. There are probably the best Jedi battles in this one compared to the other movies. These include Mace Windu, Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Palpatine and a few others as well. Pretty emotional movie too with many thoughts going through the people's minds in the movie as well as your own. Lot of cool action that was upped a lot from the first two movies and the clones did a lot more cool things too. Stunt work was also done exceptionally well and helped you like the characters more. I recommend seeing this movie in your lifetime if you never have. Very cool."
"Jan 24, 2014",4.5,"Despite still being hampered by its less-than-pleasing acting, Lucas' ""Revenge of the Sith"" rises above its faults with a dark, powerful story and amazing special effects.  As of now, it's the best Star Wars movie to come out since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of 1980.  By the end of it, die-hard fans of the series will be pleased by the way Lucas has wrapped things up here."
"Jan 24, 2014",4,"although i admit it does have flaws. It does a brilliant job of improving over it's predecessors. visually impressive though does rely a lot on digital effects. whilst not a perfect film, unlike prior instalments theres enough going for it that any negatives are easily diluted. In the end a satisfying conclusion to the star wars saga &amp; is likely to please fans and newcomers alike id even go so far to bump this up a percentage or two. The force is indeed strong with this film.(the original force not this medichloriene b.s)"
"Jan 24, 2014",4,Now...this is more like it. Can probably rank this as the 3rd best Star Wars film. Everything comes together especially in the last hour or so. The only thing that keeps it from perfection is the terrible dialogue.
"Jan 23, 2014",3,The final installment of the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy contains a grand scale of tragedy and power as would be suited to a finale of this type
"Jan 22, 2014",4.5,"Amazing and epic, Star Wars III is one of the best installment in the Star Wars series. Not to mention, it brings us over to the dark side, while still showing off its flashy visual effects."
"Jan 22, 2014",3,"Much better than the first two, Lucas had done a much better job on ending the saga by giving what the fans had truly just wanted in the first place, overall a good modern space epic..."
"Jan 21, 2014",3.5,"The best of the new films, and leads into A New Hope almost too beautifully."
"Jan 19, 2014",4.5,Awesome.This Was Better Than The First Two.Best In The Series.Not A Classic But Still Good.A-
"Jan 16, 2014",4.5,"*UPDATED REVIEW* (Beings I find it the best of the prequel trilogy, I thought it deserved a 90%. Other than that the review is unchanged.)A great send off for the prequel trilogy that would complete the saga full circle. Although a little hard to watch after Anakin turns to the dark side and all the Jedi start to be killed, the climactic fight scene makes up for it with flying colors. I salute you George Lucas."
"Jan 14, 2014",5,"Easily the best in the series,episode 3 is a dark and awsome conclusion in the prequals series"
"Jan 12, 2014",3,The best of the god awful prequals and this actually is almost as good as the originals. Almost!
"Jan 10, 2014",3,At least it was good
"Jan 08, 2014",0.5,Why ... Why is this canon
"Jan 07, 2014",3,"That thing playing Anakin deserves what he got, i hope he suffered. I know his acting career has. WHO THE FUCK PICKED HIM TO PLAY THE PREDECESSOR OF FREAKIN' DARTH VADER FOR YODA'S SAKE?"
"Jan 05, 2014",2,"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith is the best of the prequels, yet no where near as good as the originals. The dialogue is poor, the camera angles are just back and forth, in the talking scenes they are always walking somewhere, and the end duels leaves gasping for breath."
"Jan 04, 2014",3.5,"""Revenge of the Sith"" certainly does have flaws, however it is the best in the prequel trilogy. There is more exciting action, better acting and more intrigue in the story this time around."
"Jan 03, 2014",4.5,"Closing with a flourish to this epic masterpiece, he succeeded in reaching the true vision of the much better stellar galaxy of the first episodes"
"Jan 03, 2014",5,A very nice ending for all the Georges Lucas Star wars saga. Ewan McGregor in this movie is unbeliveable and Hayden Christensen make a very good Anakin Skywalker so after Empire strikes back he is my favorite of the saga .
"Jan 03, 2014",4,The last 40 min is what makes this movie worth it.
"Jan 02, 2014",4.5,"A true prequel to the Star Wars Trilogy. Although summed up in the first Star Wars movie, this story makes a great shift into the original trilogy. One of the best in the series."
"Jan 02, 2014",4.5,One of the best movies I have seen and a very interesting  story.
"Jan 01, 2014",4.5,The best star wars prequel
"Dec 31, 2013",5,"The darkest movie in the series by a long shot, it's also one of the best! Many important events take place in this episode such as Anakin transforming into the infamous Darth Vader, the birth of Luke Skywalker and princess Leia and many others. Because it's rated PG-13 don't let  your children watch this alone..."
"Dec 29, 2013",4,"While it is not in the same league as the original three, this was the best of the 3 prequels."
"Dec 27, 2013",4,"The acting is improved somewhat, but everything else is improved much more, even if it still feels like a soap opera."
"Dec 25, 2013",3.5,"A great Star Wars film and, dare I say, a great film onto itself."
"Dec 25, 2013",5,This is by fare the best so far out of the new trilogy and it is my 2nd best out of all 6 movies.
"Dec 23, 2013",5,Top Movies.   Cheesy Darth Vader No    (11)  OWN DVD
"Dec 23, 2013",2.5,"I had to sit through this because I though ""Oh it's the last film."" But I didn't enjoy it much, I almost fell asleep several times. Sure the fighting was great, but the story line was non-existent and superficial. I appreciate the film tied everything together, but it could have been done much better."
"Dec 21, 2013",5,Best of the prequels.
"Dec 20, 2013",3,"After The Abomination that was the first two Prequels, this film finally provides Star Wars fans what they're looking for. a character-driven plot and a serious film. The Film still contains crappy dialogue, overdone effects and not so great actors.  On my list it ranks as the fourth best film in the saga as it still fails to match up to the Original Trilogy."
"Dec 19, 2013",5,Words can't do it justice. This is easily my second or third favorite film in the franchise.
"Dec 19, 2013",4,"'Revenge of The Sith' is by far the best of the prequels. It's the story we all wanted from the start and it's actually a pretty good movie, both from a personal and critical point of view. The main antagonist; Anakin Skywalker is constantly under the dark pressure from his darker self, and the film does give a great inside how he became the main protagonist we all know of. His character is under an enormous pressure, and we see him develop and change in a smart and clever way. The acting by Hayden Christensen is debatable, but it's a great improvement since 'Attack of The Clones' even though he still does lack a greater and a more mature performance. This continuation got one new major character; General Grievous, who might have had a perhaps too fast introduction, and was defeated in the same vast speed. He lack the same character-depth like Count Dooku, but of course not the awesomeness since he's a very menacing and an overall awesome villain. The rest of the main characters are all well presented and there's great interactions between most of them, even though the romance between Anakin and Padmé still got some dry and forced moments, but it's still somewhat okay to watch. The dialogs however; are not as acceptable. There are still some very forced, unnecessary, dumb and weird dialogs. Sometimes you got to wonder why George won't learn from his mistakes (I'm looking at you episode I &amp; II). The vast amount of forced expositions through dialogs are also a major aspect of this third installment, but the dialogs are still not as bad as the previous films, and there are some really good ones (surprisingly!). Still, there are some really stupid moments all over the film where characters really have to explain what they feel, even though it really is obvious through the character's facial expression. Horrible.

Moving on to the action. The first act might be one of the best aspects with this movie, it's both intense and really action-packed! The whole film got much of that aspect, including many spectacular visuals and CGI. The combination with the touching music and incredible cinematography only makes it better. The plot is miles greater than what we saw in episode one and two, and there's much more feel and emotion to the story too. The third act is a big part of the Star Wars-franchise, because it connects the prequels and the original films. I really think it's an emotional part of this movie, even though the climax is a bit too overdramatic and perhaps too long. Since we all know how things are going to transpire (after ep III) is the fight between the main characters too overdramatic, and unnecessary. It lost the feel after going on for too long. It doesn't make the film greater that there are some plot holes too, but just a few of them.

'Revenge of The Sith' is the film we all wanted, but had too wait through two less impressive prequels to get here. It's a much better film and it's the story we all wanted from the start! 

Personal rating: 80/100
Critical rating: 59/100"
"Dec 17, 2013",4.5,"Very Impressive For A New Movie,Very Impressive! This Tells Alot Even If You Miss The First Two! I Never Knew Before This Movie That Darth Vader Was Once Like Luke Skywalker! It's Too Bad He Turned Against Obi-Wan At The End. Four And A Half Stars!"
"Dec 16, 2013",4.5,"Redemption in the Star Wars saga has been found. Though the first half of the movie is a more intense version of Attack of the Clones, the last half makes the movie. It is dark, exciting and a great bridge into the original trilogy."
"Dec 13, 2013",3.5,"This is definitely my favorite of the prequels. But remember, I don't love the prequels. While still SO MANY plot holes that are really big and distracting, I thought this had some good moments in it."
"Dec 11, 2013",1,"I give this film a single star because at least it is appears to be making character development, but just cannot. It is stifled too much by drawn out action scenes, stiff dialogue, stale acting, and being just all around boring."
"Dec 11, 2013",3,"Better than Episodes I and II. Alas, that doesn't say much. The set pieces were too grand in scale and many of the decisions that characters made were based on nothing more than whims. The first 30 minutes are great, but after that, it falls off pretty hard. 6/10"
"Dec 08, 2013",3,"Revenge of the Sith is just what I expected from a Star Wars prequel. Now they have cracked down and wrote a respectable story, not perfect but as good as we'll get. The effects are the best yet, and the climax is riveting. The action in the movie is top notch, and seeing the coming of Darth Vader is pretty cool. This is a non stop thrill ride, with the best lightsabers duels in the Star Wars franchise. Sometimes we get too much action, not enough story. The acting from Christensen is still not good, and the story and emotional depth doesn't quite live up to the original two movies, and the dialogue is still sometimes dumb. But I had a fun time with this movie, and it is the first really good prequel. It ties into the originals nicely and has a pretty good story. Star Wars: Episode ||| - Revenge of the Sith gets 3/5 stars (B-)."
"Dec 06, 2013",3,"You will learn to hate the tedium of Skywalker.  The script is shocking, its execution is mildly redeeming."
"Dec 05, 2013",4.5,A larger than life climax to the epic film series. Visually fantastic and great in every other aspect. George Lucas has created a super entertaining world in the star wars films.
"Dec 01, 2013",3,"Certainly darker than the other two prequels, but not up to expectations"
"Dec 01, 2013",3,Interesting in most parts but some times went a bit wonky better than 1 and 2
"Nov 30, 2013",3,"Much like its two predecessors, Revenge of the Sith has enough mindless, wall-to-wall CGI and flashy glow-stick fencing so as to be wholly intangible and even headache-inducing.  On the acting side of things, Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, and (later) Jimmy Smits hold the film together as best as they can given the schlocky screenwriting, and you can tell Hayden Christensen really is trying (by the way, that was him in the Vader suit at the end, so props).  

ROTS truly stands out among the prequels, however, in its triumphant (but still inescapably uneven and ridiculous) final act of Shakespearean tragedy and sometimes poignant melodrama.  Vader's rise towards the end, and the way he force-crushes the surgical room in his anguish, makes up for nearly every hilariously misguided Anakin character beat Lucas couldn't help but go through with.  

Revenge ultimately accomplishes the goal it sets for itself: tying the prequels and the originals together.  By that standard alone, the film is a success."
"Nov 29, 2013",5,Rewatching this and remembering how awesome it is. The best in the prequel trilogy!
"Nov 25, 2013",3.5,"A meaningful cinematic experience, Revenge of the Sith is the darkest entry in the Star Wars series, and features a breathtaking climatic battle that will chill you to the bone."
"Nov 25, 2013",4,"This improved on ""Attack of The Clones"" as it did on ""The Phantom Menace"""
"Nov 24, 2013",3,A fitting finale. Good but not great .
"Nov 17, 2013",4.5,"Este sin duda es mi episodio favorito! Mejora bastante en cuanto a historia, drama, suspenso, desarrollo, humor y acción. La cinta se torna más seria y oscura, pero mantiene un buen balance entre lo antes mencionado y lo cómico, sin quitarle la esencia a diferencia de su mediocre predecesora. El romanticismo está mejor aplicado sin ser tan cursis y ridículos, hay giros que llegan a ser transcendentales para la continuidad de la trilogía original y simplemente me impacta al saber que este es el episodio con más muertes en la saga. Una joya invaluable!"
"Nov 16, 2013",2.5,"Good Special-Effects (for its time), lightsaber duels, and a good score by John Williams are the only saving grace to give this average Star Wars film an okay watch."
"Nov 16, 2013",2,"While this movie is a step up from phantom menace and attack of the clones in terms of action, pacing, and overall story, it still has terrible dialogue, bad acting, and a very weak plot. Well, at least any kid 9 or under will like it."
"Nov 15, 2013",4.5,"This is the film it's all been building to.  Good or bad, no one could wait to see Anakin put on that infamous helmet.  Fortunately, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a great film.  Despite being a film that's ending was spoiled 28 years before its release, ""Revenge of the Sith"" still manages to throw in some dark twists along the way.

You will be hooked on this visual spectacle from the opening shot onward.  From there, the film delivers both engaging action and spiraling, dramatic plot, all of which culminates in Anakin's turn to the Dark Side.  In what is possibly the best part of the film, Anakin and Obi-Wan then engage in a thrilling lightsaber duel; the absolute best duel in the saga.

Revenge of the Sith does have a few faults.  There is a considerable amount of comedy in this film, which feels out of place for such a dark film.  Newcomer General Grievous is nothing more than a marketing gimmick.  But the biggest problem, unfortunately, is Hayden Christensen in the lead role.

Anakin Skywalker certainly should be a dark character.  But in his attempt to make Anakin dark, Christensen comes off as more apathetic and monotone than dark.  The rest of the cast does a fine job.  Ewan McGregor gives us his usual, spectacular performance as Kenobi, especially in his emotional final duel with Anakin.  Natalie Portman gives another adequate performance as Padme, though not quite as good as in ""Attack of the Clones"".

""Revenge of the Sith"" truly is a great Star Wars film, that does a fantastic job of bringing the series full circle to ""A New Hope"".  While Christensen's performance leaves a lot to be desired, it is not nearly enough to say this is a bad movie.  I definitely recommend ""Revenge of the Sith""...even if it's just to hear James Earl Jones's voice one last time."
"Nov 14, 2013",3,"Tragic, powerful, and sometimes overly melodramatic, it's the chain that links the old and the new Star Wars together."
"Nov 11, 2013",4,"The third ""Star Wars"" prequel is pretty impressive. But hey, at least it's better then ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones""!"
"Nov 10, 2013",2.5,"""Revenge of the Sith"" turns 10 this year and it was the first Star Wars movie I saw in the theater.

This is the movie everyone wanted to see happen because we finally got to see Darth Vader again, but was sitting through the entire movie really worth it? Vader only had about 3 lines and all of them were terrible. The plot of this movie was leading up to this and while it's not a terrible movie, it's not very thought provoking either. It's filler. Not at the level of ""Attack of the Clones"" filler, but most of this movie wastes its time on pointless shit. I don't care about General Grevious, I don't care about Count Dooku, I don't care about Mace Windu, and I don't even care about Anakin Skywalker and his story is the most important one. Hayden Christansen wins ANOTHER Razzie for his portrayal and came off as an absolutely hilarious idiot.

Lucas just doesn't know what he's doing here. Since this trilogy is so horribly written, I like to think of this ""prequel"" saga as a completely different species. They don't connect with the original trilogy in any way, unless Lucas has to modify the originals just so they could somewhat be in the same universe. Sigh...

I do have nostalgia for this third film, but how far can nostalgia really take you once you're not interested in what's even happening?

With the few pros: The CGI is certainly the best of the prequels. Even though they lack any heart or substance, they blend in better with their environments. Ewan McGregor gives his best performance as Obi-Wan and has some of the only few lines of dialogue that are very involving and ones that intentionally made me laugh. Seeing Ian McDiarmid reprise his role as the The Emperor in his prime is a pure joy to watch. I love watching the Emperor in this movie, he's so damn evil but he loves to be evil, and he looks so damn creepy and his voice is so goofy but can still be ominous at certain points. Like usual, John Williams' film score is fantastic and is tied with Ian McDiarmid as the two best things about this film.

""Revenge of the Sith"" is the most decent Star Wars prequel, but it's just gotten so much more uninteresting with time..."
"Nov 08, 2013",4,Miles better than the first two.
"Nov 02, 2013",4,The movie rushed Anakin Skywalker to be the bad guy. Epic final battle scene.
"Oct 30, 2013",3.5,The best prequel film.
"Oct 28, 2013",3.5,All the Jedis fall and a rise of an evil new empire.
"Oct 27, 2013",3,Defintley the best prequel
"Oct 26, 2013",4.5,"Better than both previous prequels, even die hard fans of the originals who didn't like the previous movies should enjoy this. I never did understand all the hate for the prequels."
"Oct 26, 2013",4.5,Best Star Wars movie
"Oct 24, 2013",3,"F-computer animation they should of used puppets and models like the original star wars, which look far more realistic."
"Oct 22, 2013",2,"Even though its visual effects and characters are more greater than that of Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, Revenge still loses its charisma and sheer power like the originals."
"Oct 21, 2013",1.5,"Would have been decent if it was not for the terrible acting, cheesy lines, and uninspired writing"
"Oct 21, 2013",4.5,"Lucas is FINALLY back on track to deliver one last punch packed with impressive action, some heartfelt moments, breathtaking visuals, and darkness. Noted: It still has Hayden Christensen, everyone else, and some jacked-up liners :(... BUT I STILL LOVE IT!"
"Oct 19, 2013",5,I went go see this one in theaters when I was about like 9 or 10 years old. And it is one of the best movies in the Star Wars Trilogy.
"Oct 18, 2013",1,"Awful, not as bad as Attack of the Clones. The end was tragically bad."
"Oct 13, 2013",4,"""you were the chosen one! It was said u would destroy the sith not join them!"" moments like that in the movie made my hair rise. Its a sad/epic film I just wish that anakin and obi wan would have spent more time together as friends, it would have made the final battle more dramatic. Either way it's good."
"Oct 13, 2013",1.5,Hayden Christensen brings this potentially decent movie down to a level that's insulting to fans and casual viewers alike.
"Oct 13, 2013",3.5,"I'm satisfied with this, it leaves you off perfectly for the ""next"" film."
"Oct 12, 2013",0.5,Ruins the Star Wars series. Should be taken out of the Star Wars canon. Enough said.
"Oct 12, 2013",2,"Although this was the movie I disliked the least in the prequel trilogy, it was still an awful movie. I'll start with the positives of this movie. For one, there's more action in it than its predecessors, but even then, there's nothing at stake for these characters for me to care about. I also really liked Palpatine throughout the prequels; he was just evil and enjoys being evil-and I've gotta respect that. I also liked it when Anakin choked Padme, I liked it when Anakin got burned, I liked it when Darth Vader shouted 'NOOOOOO!!!' (which is one of the funniest unintentionally comedic moments in cinema history), and I liked it when the credits rolled. Also, no Han Solo (he was not ruined like everything else was), almost no Jar Jar Binks (you only see him for a brief moment or two, but he never says anything. THANK GOD!!!) I suppose there's no point in going on since the same things are bad in this movie as they were in its other predecessors. Bad directing, bad screenwriting, bad scripting, and bad acting. My overall rating of Revenge of the Sith is a 4/10."
"Oct 12, 2013",5,was never interested till I met Javy to be wuite honest. good though LOVE it =P
"Oct 09, 2013",5,this is a awesome video
"Oct 08, 2013",3.5,"I thought it did a great job at connecting the prequels to the originals. Best of the new movies by far, but Hayden Christensen was a poor choice for Anakin."
"Oct 08, 2013",2.5,"While still suffering from some lackluster performances, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is easily the best of the subpar prequel trilogy, presenting some dark elements, slightly improved writing, and flashy entertaining action."
"Oct 07, 2013",2.5,"While still suffering from some lackluster performances, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is easily the best of the subpar prequel trilogy, presenting some dark elements, slightly improved writing, and flashy entertaining action."
"Oct 07, 2013",4,"It still maintains many of the the re-occurring problems that have plagued the prequel trilogy such as dull acting and a script that far to often missed the mark for true greatness; however ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a considerable improvement over its predecessors and concludes the saga with plenty of intense lightsaber battles, fantastic visuals, thrilling music and a return to the general vibe of what made the series so fun to begin with."
"Oct 01, 2013",4,"The best of the three prequels. Although the Phantom Menace will always hold a place in my heart because of nostalgia, but Revenge of the Sith is the better made movie because for the first time in the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy, this film felt like it was being driven by character motivation and inner struggle as opposed to politics. Yes, this movie is about the Emperor turning the Republic into the Galactic Empire and destroying the Jedi and all that political story, but for once, I was able to see the struggle Anakin was going through and the temptation of the dark side he faced. Also, for the first time in the Prequel Trilogy, I felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie as soon as it started. The opening action sequence is straight up fun Star Wars unlike the other two films with boring political dialogue from lifeless characters. All the action felt like it had stakes therefore I was more infested in the war scenes and the lightsaber battles. But again, this film isn't without it's cringeworthy scenes, especially when *Spoiler Alert* Anakin finally decides to turn to the dark side and when he threatens Obi-Wan on Mustafar. Like... I was laughing out loud. But, there were more great scenes to overthrow the bad ones. The opening action sequence, the opera scene, and, ""Execute Order 66"" Overall, this is the best of the prequels with the best action and most emotion"
"Sep 30, 2013",3,"Lucas finally does not mess up....as much. ""The circle is now complete"" with the 2005 release of the final Star Wars film (although more are to come) of the 6-film series. While the first film of the prequel trilogy focused too much on little Annie Skywalker, Episode III doesn't really focus on one particular thing. The Clone Wars are closing up, we all know Dooku's time is running out, the Emperor will take over, [a very popular] General Grievous needs to be taken off the road, the fates of many of our beloved characters needs to be addressed, and the setting needs to be ""installed"" for the events in Episode IV to unfold. And guess what, Lucas decides to include every single one of those into one movie and that's the true sole detrimental factor of 'Revenge of the Sith.' You can't have that many ships on the lake at the same time, it's just hard to even care about a lot of them (considering that a lot of the material was largely ignored or barely mentioned in the previous two films). 'Revenge of the Sith's' strongest points rest in John William's orchestral score (as presented in the film, not the soundtrack version since so many cues are missing) and the long-awaited transformation of Anakin/Darth Vader (included are the Yoda/Sidious and Obi-Wan/Skywalker lightsaber duels). The anticipation is at its height in this movie, we (the fans/audience) care when the Jedi are killed via Order 66, we care when Obi-Wan has to leave a horribly-burnt Anakin behind on Mustafar, we care when Yoda fails to defeat Darth Sidious/The Emperor, and we care when Padme dies delivering her babies [two crucial characters of the superior original trilogy]. But...as previously stated, there's also a lot more happening in Episode III--too many gears turn at the same time which results in a the batter that is bitterly satisfying. The fact is, this Star Wars (like the previous two) is lacking in too many of the essentials: everything feels forced (no pun intended). It's almost as if we're being compelled to care about what's going on. There are really only a handful of scenes that are done right that enable me to even say a few good thing about this film because if it weren't for those scenes, I'd probably hate this film. I remember going to the theaters and hearing people laugh at R2-D2 for behaving clumsily, but was that really necessary? It's almost like giving Jar-Jar Binks a bigger role in the movie, but I guess we need a reminder that this is a kid's movie. A kid's movie that isn't even recommended for kids because it's PG-13. A kid's movie about death, killing, slaughter, loss, fear, dictatorships, violence, war, demise of friendship, people burning up, oh and Anakin killing children! Yup, definitely material suited for ALL ages!!! Everything is so rushed into getting Anakin into the Vader suit that the sense of urgency among all the characters becomes diminished. Anakin informs Samuel L Jackson that Palpatine is the Sith Lord and...they don't rush to take him down? Since I've mentioned it, the scene where Emperor Palpatine kills the 3 other Jedi who accompany Jackson was shot horribly and it's bothered me since the first time I watched this film (""force speed"" my ass). I'd understand if he was quick enough to kill 1 Jedi but not two (especially the way that Lucas directed it). Another problem with Palpatine is the fact that it's no secret that he's the one pulling the strings, it's no secret that he's evil, he seems so sinister (even before he's scarred or whatever) that it really makes us wonder why on earth the Jedi didn't confront him right away, and why on earth would Sidious make it so obvious that he's evil if he's trying to keep his identity hidden? I can tell you this, the question should have been: 'who is Plapatine?' versus 'when is Palpatine going to take over?' Everything in this film seems war-less, if anyone's seen the Clone War series (either one), you'd know that the war took place throughout the galaxy and even in the big cities; wasn't the opening scene over Coruscant and....why did everything seem normal? There's no real threat in other words, we're just told that the Separatists are threatening but we never see it. As I said in my Phantom Menace review, there's a lot of material that should been included in the prequel trilogy that was completely omitted. 'How this movie should have started' all the way to 'how it should have ended' are questions that I can't even answer simply because it involves completely re-imagining the first and second movies (if that's possible, considering how bad they were). The prequel trilogy is mainly outweighed by its negative aspects, luckily, 'Revenge of the Sith' is slightly heavier on the positives (mainly the awesome lightsaber duels, excluding the one with Greivous) but only slightly. It's far from surpassing 'Empire' or 'A New Hope' but it certainly stands tall against 'Menace' and 'Clones.' If there's one real reason to watch 'Revenge of the Sith,' it's to watch Anakin burn because it certainly isn't to hear Vader cry out, ""NOOOO"" like a pussy.

***Let me just add that General Grevious having four arms was a stupid idea especially if it only takes one Jedi to defeat him. He should be able to block his opponent's lightsaber with one limb and completely slice up his foe with the rest of his arms. What is the benefit of having four arms if they're not used properly? If it were up to me, his character wouldn't exist or he'd have two arms."
"Sep 29, 2013",4,The best Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back.
"Sep 28, 2013",2,"I disagree with the tomatometer here. Episode III isn't better than Episode VI. The acting is pretty good (except for Hayden Christensen's acting), the special effects were good too. The score is awesome as usual, but those are the only things that are good from this movie. The story is poor. Anakin is supposed to be seduced by the dark side but he's not. He's blackmailed to the dark side. He has no choice but to join it. But when he does, nothing changes. He's suddenly evil for no reason. He has no new powers. Hell, his lightsaber isn't even red at the end! While an improvement to the first two, it still is a pretty bad movie, and it's NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINALS!!!"
"Sep 25, 2013",4,"Okay, it's the final hurrah of Master Lucas' prequel trilogy, not that a great deal of mastery was shown with the last film or any with the one prior to, but this was his chance to make right what was wrong, did he do it. My answer, at least, is a resounding, YES! After all of the Star Wars heart break and near loss of fandom we had to endure between horrible love stories and brain dead frog creatures Lucas finally puts one out that, dare I say, is almost on par with the classics, though more in the summer blockbuster than the classic sense. The film starts out with a fantastic space ship battle on a much grander scale than the originals could muster unfortunately, then it goes straight to a great series of perfectly choreographed lightsaber fights, the introduction of a new villain, General Grievous voiced by Matthew Wood, and (SPOILER) the departure of another (END OF SPOLIER) all leading up to a spectacularly gripping crash landing sequence of an enormous Separatist battleship. We're 30 some odd minutes in and already the movie is jam packed with everything we loved about the originals. Then they go to the Jedi temple and develop the plot a bit more, but they don't take too much time as to make it unbearably boring as with the previous two films. Then we get straight back into the action as Obi-Wan Kenobi, still played by the now Star Wars veteran Mr. Ewan McGregor, goes to investigate a lead on the whereabouts of General Grievous. Ewan who at this point seems is completely engulfed and, in my opinion, believable in his role as the younger old Ben, remains one of my favorite parts of the prequel trilogy and one of the best actors in the films. Grievous is fine as a more classical seeming Star Wars villain, as in he's essentially a less menacing, deeply evolved or imposing Darth Vader with worse asthma and a storm trooper exoskeleton but, truth be told, he doesn't really matter as he's more of an in and out type character to simply distract us from the real villain. That's right we all know I'm talking about, Jar Jar Binks (a.k.a. ""He who shall not be named"") has made his 5 minute return! But seriously we all knew it was going to happen sometime and yes, it finally does, the Emperor himself rears his very ugly head in his attempt to turn little Ani to the dark side, will he succeed? Well, if you've seen any of the original trilogy, you know the answer to that. One thing that somewhat bothered me was that they tried to play the unveiling of the Emperor as if we had no idea, because I'm pretty sure the first time we saw a certain (SPOILER) Senator (END OF SPOILER) who wears the exact same robe as the Emperor in all of his video chats between his minion pin pals we all knew that already. But I digress, Vader does begin his mean streak in this one and he has no problem killing a few Younglings along the way. Yes, this Vader is very dark and you thought cutting his son's hand off was bad. But Vader goes on his killing spree to clean up the trash of the galaxy while Natalie Portman as Padme has twins, I wonder who they could be? (SPOILER) (cough) Luke and (cough) Leia (END OF SPOILER). But all of this leads up to what we had all been waiting for, this film ends with I will be so bold to say the most phenomenally exciting and epic lightsaber battle in Star Wars film history. Yep, this is the big one, there may have been some iconic shots from the lightsaber fights in the old films but this is the one that George Lucas and every Star Wars fan had wet dreams about since they first saw Episode IV. I hesitate to even call it just a ""lightsaber fight"" because it is so incredibly grand scale and fantastic, it's more of a operatic lightsaber super nova, I mean theres thunder, there's lightning, there's lava all over the place and it ends by showing you just how old Darth Vader got his trademark scarred up egg head. This movie was incredible to me at the time it is one of my personal favorite Star Wars films along side the first three and if it weren't for the return of Har Har Dingus and Hayden Christensen as Anakin sounding like he's yawning in the way he fluctuates his voice while he's yelling in every emotional scene, this might even be a 5 out of 5. But alas, 'tis a 4, for Reinvigorated Star Wars Fans United, this is The Truth You Can't Handle, signing off."

"Sep 23, 2013",2,what more could possibly be said about these horrible prequels?
"Sep 23, 2013",1,"An epic saga in which a man with a beard fights a moody guy, robots do things, and some people die. Clearly a story for the ages."
"Sep 23, 2013",5,Awesome in 2D. Can't wait to see it in 3D.
"Sep 23, 2013",4.5,The best of the prequel trilogy.

"Sep 22, 2013",3.5,"""Star Wars"" 1-3 are nice prequel sequels to the popular ""Star Wars"" series so are a must for the library."
"Sep 22, 2013",4,not bad come have told more story
"Sep 21, 2013",2,"Though this is certainly the best of three prequels, Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith disappoints. Audiences expected the dramatic fall of Anakin Skywalker, but instead get the fall of Hayden Christensen's acting. The movie had the potential to capture Anakin's dark, stirring and passionate conversion to the Dark Side, but Christensen is unable to perform beyond the caliber of a high school drama club audition. The imaginative artistry and creative alien life are impressive, but they do not mask the film's blatant inadequacies. I think Lucas would have been wiser to create one fantastic prequel rather than three mediocre ones. Children under the age of 12 will love it, but the rest of us will be checking our watches. Rent it, don't buy it."
"Sep 18, 2013",0.5,"The conclusion to the awful, CGI fest, nonsensical, awful acting, terrible dialogue, uninteresting characters, boring political trade federation crap and unemotional battles including prequel trilogy. I'll stick to Empire Strikes Back. J.J., please do a better job."
"Sep 18, 2013",4,"For many people, the 'Star Wars' prequels are like that time you were raped in the Hungry Jacks bathroom.  They'd rather pretend it simply never happened.  Now I understand all the million reasons why these films sucked (I'm finally acquainted with Mr. Plinkett) but I've gotta be honest, and say that as much as I love the classic 'Star Wars' films, I still find these ones enjoyable as well.  This is the best of the three, and although it's still riddled with lazy directing and soulless acting, it finally manages to pack at least some emotion power in its story.  The ""legendary"" fight between Obi Wan and Anakin is boring as hell, but I really liked the sequence when all the clones turned on their allies, and took out almost the entire Jedi order.  I hated the delivery of that little boy's line to Anakin (""Master Skoiwalker, there are too many of them, what are we going to do?"") but I loved the implication that he slaughtered the children.  Not because I'm an asshole, but because it was actually pretty sad.  This movie actually garners a little emotion from its audience, and I guess I respect it for that.  The effects are, as always, a cover-up for the film's many other shortcomings, but they're still impressive all the same.  At the end of the day, anyone who hates these prequels shouldn't have even watched this at all.  For those who can forgive their inferiority to the original classics, there is still much to enjoy in 'Revenge Of The Sith'."
"Sep 17, 2013",4.5,"How could Anakin fall into dark side? He believes his power could do something special, but what he had done is to make himself special to Jedi, a Sith."
"Sep 16, 2013",0.5,"When I first saw this film, I decided that I would rather sodimize myself with a chainsaw then ever see more of George Lucas's work. This movie represents everything wrong with 21st century cinema. Enormous budgets wasted on visual effects and unsatisfying action sequences, while the simple beauty of good story telling is gone; murdered, hacked to bits, where Jeffery Dahmer likely mad sweet love to the remaining intact body parts. To conclude,dont see this movie. In-fact if your even considering it..... Well then you should be ashamed! LIKE FOR CHIRST SAKE! IT'S A RERELEASE! AND IT WAS TERRIBLE THE FIRST TIME AROUND!"
"Sep 16, 2013",4.5,Stunning finale to the second trilogy of films. Action packed with stunning cinematography and a pulsating dark heart. Yes it can all seem a little predictable to the cynics and it is not without its flaws - but this is an entertaining and mature addition to the Star Wars legacy.
"Sep 15, 2013",0.5,3D is absolutely unnecessary
"Sep 15, 2013",4,An epic finale to the prequel saga.  Its everything you hoped it would be.
"Sep 15, 2013",1,a huge disappointment.
"Sep 13, 2013",5,this movie is great it is not as good as all of the other ones but the movie is a 5 out of 5 if you are a star wars fan you are going to like this movie i am so glad that they made 4 5 and 6 because i would not like it if the did not make any more.
"Sep 12, 2013",4,Awesome movie cant wait to see it in 3D

"Sep 07, 2013",3,The star wars we were waiting for.
"Sep 07, 2013",5,Great special effects give the prequels something that have been lacklustre and great acting by the leads which the prequels has lacked

"Sep 05, 2013",3.5,"Due to its dramatics fueled by an excellent score and a grand spectacle of a third act, Revenge of the Sith is a passable film with decent entertainment and somewhat better writing. It still, however, plunges into cliche dialogue, ill-presented characters, a slight loss of direction, and an emotionless engine."
"Sep 05, 2013",3,"Containing less-ish of the bad dialogue, Revenge Of The Sith is more bearable than the previous films"
"Sep 04, 2013",3,"Best of the star wars prequels, great movie."
"Sep 04, 2013",4.5,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith does everything the previous two Star Wars movies failed too. We're given a movie with such dramatic depth and so much mythology to delve into. That combined with strong performances from almost every actor and fantastic CGI and special effects make Revenge of the Sith a winner.

"Sep 03, 2013",5,Not what everyone makes it out to be. Great movie with a heartfelt ending.
"Sep 03, 2013",4,"George Lucas finally gets it right again (mostly) in the final (for now) installment in the saga. With the meatiest bits of the story to go, Revenge of the Sith is a much tighter and action packed film than the previous two, where the impressive effects finally work and even the politics scenes feel necessary. It benefits hugely from the iconic elements of the originals, giving a satisfying, though very dark, end to the saga. Just hearing Vader's first breath is spine-tinglingly awesome.
Excellent."
"Sep 02, 2013",5,awesome and dramatic movie.
"Sep 02, 2013",3,"Guilty pleasure for the action. However, some action scenes could have been improved since Genndy made his short cartoons more engaging."
"Sep 02, 2013",3.5,"Okay. The dialogue is not that great, but go watch the 1970/80's films on Closed Caption. It wasn't great then either. The conclusion of the series felt natural especially going into the next three chapters. The script answered questions long asked and set up new questions for the next generation. Was it the best film I've seen, no. Was it enjoyable, yes."
"Sep 02, 2013",3,"Substantially better than the previous two efforts, the sixth installment contains a lot more of what made Star Wars what it was, and a lot less of the boring political banter. All of the dialogue still sucks, though."
"Sep 01, 2013",3.5,"I loved it always been a star wars fan. In waiting for the next sequel.


















I loved it. A masterpiece can't wait

 for the star wars movie."
"Aug 29, 2013",4,"By far the strongest of the three prequels. Revenge of the Sith features epic action, impressive visuals, and melodrama. Basically all the prequel actors give their best performance of the three films in ROTS. McDiarmid's devilishly over-the-top turn as Palpatine (going full Sith) is one of the wildest, most entertaining bits of acting ever put to the screen. The stakes finally feel like they count, unlike the first two films. The dialogue is still pretty clunky in parts, but aside from slowing down a bit in the middle act, the pace keeps things humming along. There are no 50 minute gaps filled with cringe inducing dialogue as in Episodes 1 &amp; 2. ROTS benefits greatly from having more action in it than the previous two films combined. The last 15 minutes of this movie are the best the prequels have to offer, and connect really nicely to A New Hope. As a kid, this movie was more exciting to me than anything I had ever seen. Watching as an adult it mostly holds up, it can be clunky and corny like the first two prequels but it remains entertaining/engaging throughout."
"Aug 28, 2013",4,Wow! This was such a big improvement over the first two prequels. It still has a lot of problems but It has a lot of great things too and I enjoy it every time I watch it.
"Aug 28, 2013",4.5,the best of the prequels but not by much
"Aug 27, 2013",4.5,"Dark and action packed, although parts of the movie failed in the script side of things, I walked away satisfied and hungry for a lightsaber duel"
"Aug 27, 2013",0.5,Fanboys will love it. 93736161930 hour battle lacking any tension or emotional buy-in ... but now in 3D. Ugh
"Aug 26, 2013",4,"A solid Star Wars story which deserves appreciation!

4/5 stars"
"Aug 25, 2013",4.5,An underrated and misunderstood tragedy.
"Aug 25, 2013",0.5,"If you want to see a good movie that has star wars in it, check out red letter media, he does reviews of the star wars films and goes into detail about why they are so bad."
"Aug 23, 2013",0.5,"Every single prequel to the Star Wars franchise failed miserably. Even though this is the easiest prequel to tolerate, the movie is still easily classified as garbage"
"Aug 23, 2013",2.5,"At long last, the end of the saga that started almost 30 years earlier. The dark times shown are much more redeemable than what we've seen in the prequel trilogy so far. Still it lacks chemistry between main characters, and Hayden Christensen turned Darth Vader from embodiment of evil, to a wimpy teenager that wets his bed."
"Aug 20, 2013",3.5,"Much needed improvement over Attack of the Clones, but too little too late for writing and character development. Whiney performance by Hayden Christiansen, with a kid who found dad's gun version of a villain is disappointing. This is not the great and evil Darth Vader, this is a puppet who has less motivation to be angry and spiteful than all the fans disappointed by the performance. Action scenes are vastly improved. Refocus on lightsaber fights was praiseworthy. If you recall the very fake choreography from Attack of the Clones that left Anakin missing an arm, this by far makes up for it. Still worth having in any fan's collection. Worth rewatching once in a while too."
"Aug 20, 2013",2,"What can be considered one of the most important episodes of the series, ep3 falls flat. In the scene where Anakin finally ""turns to the dark side"" I expected to see a dark and evil character surface. Instead we are treated to a whimpering and spineless Vader-to-be, buckling under the cries of the obvious Sith Lord he throws Mace Windu out the window. I wasn't aware that bullying was all it took for the savior to turn against good. But such is the case in the birth of Darth Vader. Thankfully, the series will be saved by J.J. Abrams in a new episode of Star Wars."
"Aug 20, 2013",5,One of the BEST Star War movies made!
"Aug 18, 2013",3,Not best but good enough.
"Aug 18, 2013",1,This movie is the final outrage in the derpfest that the prequel trilogy has become. Never watch this movie.
"Aug 17, 2013",5,"The best of the 3 prequels to the timeless Star Wars franchise. Serious, fun, good character development and entertaining. Anakin's tragic descent to the dark side is perfectly realized and perceptive."
"Aug 17, 2013",3.5,"At last, the saga is complete. Everything has come full circle, and we can finally understand exactly how everything in the very first &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; movie came into being. Well, sort of. There are still some gaps, most of which don't matter, but for the main characters, it all makes sense. I am content with this. This film makes up for the blunder that was &lt;i&gt;Attack of the Clones&lt;/i&gt;. Not entirely, mind you, but I thought that maybe the inspiration was gone from George Lucas' mind. That's not the case; this is the best of the &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; prequels.

It's not really that the movie itself was anything special. It's mostly just a whiz-bang effort of action scenes and special effects. But that we have everything pieced together now brings new understanding to the war that didn't seem to matter in the, by release date, first three films. It lets us understand why the bad guys are the bad guys -- it seemed beforehand that they were evil just because the series needed villains -- and how they came to be that way. I wouldn't go so far as to say that &lt;i&gt;Revenge of the Sith&lt;/i&gt; makes the earlier films better, but it certainly helped in comprehending them.

The &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; universe is so big, and it's easy to feel lost within it. This film brings it all together, at least, as far as the movies are concerned. It answered pretty much all of the questions that I had, and did so in an entertaining and effective manner that (mostly) made sense. Was it perfect? Absolutely not, but I found myself more forgiving than I have been since the very first installment.

This is the climax you've been waiting for. Teased for the last couple of films, this is when Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) finally becomes the villain we knew him as in the original trilogy. That transformation occurs at the midway point of this film, for reasons that I will not spoil. This isn't a ""destination"" film; it's one about the journey. You know how it has to end, for the most part, and you're here to see the small events and to further understand the why behind these moments in time. You get all that here.

You also get a great deal of action scenes, filled with some very impressive special effects. &lt;i&gt;Revenge of the Sith&lt;/i&gt; comes three years after &lt;i&gt;Attack of the Clones&lt;/i&gt;, and the CGI has improved since then. The earlier film often felt fake, while this one is more believable. Sure, it's still a flurry of special effects in a lot of the scenes, but at least it's eye-candy this time around and not eye-vegetables. The film returns to the franchise roots of looking visually outstanding.

You get some very fun lightsaber duels, force powers being taken to their extremes, some ship battles, and even another jungle type area where we get a Chubacca cameo. Sure, the last one seemed really forced in there -- we don't get to see Han Solo, by the way, so don't even ask -- but it's a nice surprise and I have to admit that I smiled. The film is entertaining for its entirety, which was the biggest problem that the last one had. It was dull, and not a whole lot happened. This one has seemingly everything happen and you always have something to admire.

The only real character growth comes from Anakin, which turns him from a bratty teenager into the lord of darkness. This would have worked better had Hayden Christensen not played the role. I don't generally think he's a bad actor -- see some of his non-&lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; roles for examples of that -- but him playing the dark and sinister type is just way too tough a sell. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt here, but I couldn't stop seeing him as the small kid trying to make himself look big and tough and scary. Maybe giving him the helmet right after the turn instead of at the very end would have helped this.

There's a lot of gravitas to this film. Like the conclusion to the first trilogy, there's a sense of danger at every moment. People could easily, and will, die in this movie. You know the primary players survive, but who won't? And how will they be killed? You want the answers to these questions, even if you don't necessarily want to see a beloved side character get the ax.

Most of the actors still aren't very good here, save for Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi who actually gets more than one character moment. Natalie Portman's Padmé gets absolutely nothing to do with herself, and the same is true of both of the droids. It's not actors that make this movie a success. It's the payoff from all of the world building that had been done in each of the previous installments, and the payoff you have in your mind when you piece everything together. That it looks incredible is a bonus.

&lt;i&gt;Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith&lt;/i&gt; is a very fine conclusion to the second &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; trilogy. As a standalone film, it's a decent spectacle. As the conclusion to a mediocre trilogy tasked with setting up a fantastic one? I thought it did a really solid job. It helps in understanding the films that, chronologically speaking, come afterward, and it's the payoff from all of the universe building and exploration that we've done over the course of the previous films. The saga is at an end, and it's worth it."
"Aug 14, 2013",5,"People often give the prequels a bad rap. While episode III might not be perfect in every way, but what it does right... It really does right! Star Wars fans won't be disappointed with this movie."
"Aug 13, 2013",4,Sócio!!! Assim........ SIM!!! :)
"Aug 12, 2013",3,This movie is only somewhat entertaining.  If not for the fact that it is Star Wars I would never have given this one a second look.  It did not get any better.
"Aug 12, 2013",4.5,(Spoilers Alert) Love everything about Star Wars!!! And this film challenges my thoughts again about which star wars film is the best?!?!?! Good film but I love the battle at the end between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Vader/Anakin!!! Great!! Much watch if your a Star Wars fan!!!
"Aug 12, 2013",1,why are they releasing again? greedy
"Aug 12, 2013",4,"This is the best of the prequels, the story is good and compelling, the effects and lightsaber battles are awesome, and this movie is a huge improvement over the first two films."
"Aug 08, 2013",1,A turd in 3d is still a turd.   NOOOOOOOO!!!
"Aug 08, 2013",4.5,really awesome movie
"Aug 08, 2013",3.5,Starts off weak ends strong
"Aug 06, 2013",3,This is the best entry from the three prequels but still suffers from horrible dialogue and an overuse of special effects. It continues to cheapen the Star Wars franchise and still doesn't hold a candle to any of the three originals.
"Aug 06, 2013",3.5,This was an equally good one. I rate it higher than Attack because it's the third film and it's a rarity to see the third film properly end the trilogy.
"Aug 06, 2013",5,The force is strong on this one!
"Aug 06, 2013",3,Better than the first two but not better than the original trilogy.
"Aug 05, 2013",4.5,The only good of the new trilogy
"Aug 05, 2013",4.5,The best star wars movie! Well at least in the prequel trilogy...
"Aug 04, 2013",3.5,"Finally a worthy entry to the Star Wars series since Return of the Jedi in 1983, Revenge of the Sith has just enough action and great directing, although the dialogue is ridiculous."
"Aug 03, 2013",5,"Best of the entire saga
Nuff said"
"Aug 03, 2013",4.5,"Trust me, this is the best prequel episode yet in the beloved Star Wars Saga."
"Aug 02, 2013",5,still has some issues but definitely is the best of the prequels.
"Aug 02, 2013",3.5,"For the Two Of you Who don't Know this, Modern Movie Audiences Love there Movies Dark, Grey,&amp; Depressing.
And even though adding Dark Elements to a film can work in Certain Movies Like E.T. &amp; An American Tale. There will always be THAT movie that Plays the Whole Dark thing in an Over-The-Top fassion because it Knows that it's other qualities are Extremely Lacking, This is Sadly one of those movies. 
But, In my Opinion This Film Ranks in the SO Bad Its Entertaining Category ( For the Most Part).   
In this Film The Actors Try their best to Act their way through that Pile Of Fequal Matter called the script. But It Comes off as Hilariously Bad. The Villans General Grievous &amp; The Emperor are Entertaining Hammy Characters and Make the film More watchable Than it's Predecessors. Un happily Out of all the Star Wars Films this one Sadly has the worst Special Effects, Even When I First saw this in Theaters I Saw the Effects as Cartoony and Way Too CGI, The Moments that are Dark Just Come off as Cheesy Due to the Lame script and Desperate Acting.
  Every thing in this Film Looks  and sounds so Painfully Fake it Just Brakes the Emersion.
But Overall Despite the Amount of Bad in this Film I still Enjoy it, Its A guilty Pleasure of mine.
Again if you want a Deeper And Gorier Version of what's bad in this Film Watch this -&gt;

"Aug 01, 2013",4.5,"What a great movie! Episodes one and two received a lot of flack for their production quality, dialogue and acting, but everything was stepped up a huge notch in this movie! I can't remember the last time I've seen such huge space battles, tons of fighting between troopers, so many light saber duels, and an epic finale. The visuals were outstanding! It was also really cool to see Anakin's turn to the Darkside as Darth Vader. All in all, a wonderful addition to the series!"
"Jul 31, 2013",4,The birth of Darth Vader!
"Jul 30, 2013",4.5,pretty damn good only big negative besides story plots and some sketchyish character development  really was Hayden's performance as Skywalker but really its not that terrible film. some great specials fx some really good acting from McGregor and Portman
"Jul 29, 2013",4.5,Revenge of the Sith is a dark and powerful conclusion to the Star Wars prequel trilogy that makes up for its occasionally stilted narrative.
"Jul 29, 2013",3.5,"definitely the smartest of the prequel trilogy. undeniably flawed with goofy dialog that even Stephanie Meyer would chuckle at. but that doesn't mean its substance and plot isn't powerful enough to create a good, if not great film. the music score, the weight of the emotion in these scenes, everything makes up for the screenplay and its dialog. its definitely a brawns film than it is with brains."
"Jul 28, 2013",0.5,"I hated this film much worse than Episode 1. The Star Wars universe is destroyed by all the plot holes in this stupid action movie. The sad thing is, the action is BORING. There are NO STAKES. We all know the Jedi are going to die, we all know Anakin gets the suit because he didn't in episode 2, we all know Padme dies, we all know Obi-Wan lives in that fight, we all know the clones are storm troopers (EVEN THOUGH THAT'S STUPID). The movie is just a mess and I can't believe it had an 80% on here."
"Jul 28, 2013",3.5,This one is the only semi good one of the prequels
"Jul 28, 2013",3,And Darth was Bourne
"Jul 25, 2013",3,"Maybe better than the Attack of the clones, solely because of action but the acting wasn't good enough to make it stick out and be a great movie."
"Jul 25, 2013",4,"Darkest of the ""Star Wars"" saga ever since ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back."" And I didn't look at Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader the way I used to think of him.

Obviously the prequels aren't as well-received as the original trilogy, but in the grander scale of the whole saga, the prequels piece clicks into place with the originals. George Lucas was always more of a conceptual thinker. His ideas for Episodes I, II and III were great, but he can't execute those ideas well without a crew that can challenge him creatively (a crew that can be No-men at times). That's part of the success of the original trilogy. Yes Episode III has its flaws just like Episodes I and II did, but it's the best of the prequels."
"Jul 24, 2013",4,"Excelentes efectos, la mejor de las precuelas sin duda, y muy buena forma de unir la historia con el Episodio 4."
"Jul 23, 2013",4.5,Lives up to the legacy of the original trilogy. Just enjoy the movie. A
"Jul 22, 2013",2,"Bad, I don't know what happened."
"Jul 22, 2013",0.5,"Why!?!?  Episodes 1,2, and 3 were awful. You have the movies in BluRay"
"Jul 22, 2013",5,"Action-packed and thrilling, we finally have the Star Wars movie we deserve in an epic and emotional fashion."
"Jul 21, 2013",4,"The most passable installment in the Star Wars prequel saga, though I can't wait for J.J. Abrams' Episode VII."
"Jul 21, 2013",5,123 are better then 456
"Jul 20, 2013",4,"doesn't quite make up for episodes I &amp; ll, but tries like hell.  Brings everything together exceptionally."
"Jul 20, 2013",3,the best of the prequels. the effects are top notch and I'm glad this mess is over with.
"Jul 20, 2013",5,"This is my favorite Star Wars movie. The originals were amazing, but this should get more respect. The CGI is amazing to look at because it's colorful and bright. The pacing is more consistent and as a result, we get some really good action scenes. Revenge of the Sith is dramatic with the romance portion of it. The dialogue is a bit cheesy but that's a nit pick. Anakin has a conflict in him, whether he should turn to the dark side or not. That's a great conflict. To be honest, I have no problems with this movie at all. To me it is a perfect movie and a spectacular wrap up of the franchise."
"Jul 18, 2013",3.5,"Better than Lucas's other prequels, but not nearly comparable to the three original Star Wars films. I thought the dialogue could've been MUCH better. I personally thought ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart!"" was very cheesy and they could've done much better. The so-so acting and classic Star Wars prequel boring Coruscant scenes really detracted from this movie's potential greatness. I really have to emphasize on Coruscant though, because ever since the Phantom Menace, these prequels have had do many boring scenes on Coruscant that I rely on the action scenes to make me not turn off the TV. There are many scenes when it shows the jedi masters in the Council being killed by clones, but since the last two movies have given no backstories to these characters, all we remember them for are the boring Coruscant conferences they're in so we don't really care wjen they die. Overall has entertaining action, so-so acting, not-too-great dialogue, and lots of characters you don't care about dying. If you are a Star Wars fan that has already taken the beating of episodes 1 and 2, you may or may not like this. Regular movie-goers will find this entertaining, but they will criticize the dialogue for sure."
"Jul 17, 2013",4.5,"Star Wars III: Revenge Of The Sith, finally hits where the other two missed and bring us the best chapter of this second trilogy and, although not bigger than any of the episodes of the original trilogy, it is just next to be just like it."
"Jul 17, 2013",4.5,One of the best of all times
"Jul 17, 2013",4,"This personally is my 3rd fav Star Wars movie. (New Hope 2nd and Empire Strikes Back 1st) I love Hayden Christensen for Anakin, he is into the role and is fit for the character. Although lots of bonds are broken but the beginning is great! I thought Grievous (My favorite SW villain) was killed way too early. They couldve had him in A New Hope or Attack of the Clones, a two hour lifespan isnt great for a movie, especially because he had no character developent or background story. But the ending is strong and intense considering the anger and darkness brought into the end. I love the battles and all the different planets brought in. Fair acting, dated effects and fine plot, all in all 4 stars."
"Jul 16, 2013",5,The best one ever period.
"Jul 16, 2013",3,"Defiantly the best of the Prequels. Most of the movie is good, but nothing ground breaking. It suffers from over use of CGI yet again and poor acting from Anakin. My favorite part of the entire Prequels is the last part of this movie (because it reminds me of the originals). It's filled with nostalgia."
"Jul 16, 2013",5,Always my favorite movie series.
"Jul 16, 2013",3,"Grade - C+
Although the best of the prequels, 'Revenge of the Sith' is still highly problematic, and continues the prequels habit of overusing CGI."
"Jul 16, 2013",5,This is my favorite of the current 6 starwars movies i highly recomend this series!!
"Jul 16, 2013",4,"George Lucas sigue cagandola pero ahora en menor medida. Por mucho el mejor episodio de las precuelas, pero dista de ser el mejor de toda Star Wars (aunque es mi favorito)."
"Jul 16, 2013",4,The best film in the prequel trilogy. Has a climax that is intense and full of emotion
"Jul 16, 2013",4.5,best star war flick...awesum
"Jul 15, 2013",2.5,"Una pésima excusa para una trilogía no podía cerrar de peor manera: malas actuaciones, pésima historia, terrible dirección, gracias George Lucas por arruinar por completo la primer trilogía"
"Jul 15, 2013",3.5,"The most entertaining out of the most recent star wars movies, but still does not nearly compare to any of the originals."
"Jul 15, 2013",4,This one got better but the editing was too choppy.
"Jul 15, 2013",1.5,"Hayden Christiansen is too whiny, self entitled and arrogant to be darth vader. Props for being better than its previous two predecessors but that in itself doesn't say much."
"Jul 14, 2013",2,The CGI is vastly better but the acting is pure garbage! The story isn't compelling and doesn't give Anakin enough real cause to completely betray EVERYTHING and turn to the darkside. The opening 15 minutes and Ewan McGregor are the only reasons to watch this one.
"Jul 14, 2013",5,Full revised review coming soon
"Jul 14, 2013",5,This is the 1st and best Star Wars movie of all time
"Jul 13, 2013",4.5,Every stars wars is awesome
"Jul 13, 2013",5,the greatest out of the prequel trilogy
"Jul 13, 2013",4,the battle of Master Kenobi &amp; Master Skywalker....
"Jul 13, 2013",3,This was a little better than the other crappy prequels. C
"Jul 12, 2013",5,"i loved it its a must see movie so
 much action"
"Jul 11, 2013",5,Great movie. I am a HUGE HUGE HuGE Star Wars fan
"Jul 10, 2013",3.5,The best of the prequels but that is not a big accomplishment.
"Jul 10, 2013",2.5,Episode three is like the flu...by the third time it's not as bad as before.
"Jul 09, 2013",3.5,Its good but i like episode v the empire strikes back now i give it a 3/5
"Jul 09, 2013",5,An masterpiece conclusion.
"Jul 08, 2013",3,Flawed but entertaining.
"Jul 06, 2013",3,"Out of the 3 prequels, this was the best one, but not the best Star Wars movie"
"Jul 06, 2013",4,"It has many flaws, but its good parts make up for it."
"Jul 06, 2013",5,"For the most part, I enjoy each of the first 5 Star Wars movies. While none of them are perfect (some of them have conspicuous flaws), they all provide ranging levels of solid entertainment. Well it was much to my surprise, and genuine delight, that George Lucas actually saved the best for last! And it's not just the best in the prequel trilogy, but the best in the Saga overall. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith marks the closest thing to a perfect Star Wars movie. It has the best story, the best drama, the best special effects, the best action, the most emotional heft, and the best ending.

The story focuses once again on Anakin Skywalker. After his marriage to Padmé Amidala at the end of Attack of the Clones, Anakin learns that Padmé is pregnant with their child. Shortly thereafter, Anakin starts having premonitions of Padmé dying at childbirth. These fears become so real to him that reaches a point where he'll do anything to save his wife. When the malevolent Darth Sidious tells Anakin that the only way he can save Padmé is by learning the ways of the Dark Side, Anakin is faced with a decision that will change the Force for decades to come.

When reviewing the first two Star Wars prequels, it was necessary to take a few paragraphs to explain all the bad elements of the movies. But I personally don't find any flaws in Revenge of the Sith. Sure a jaded fan of the original trilogy could nit-pick his cynical holes in this, but I certainly won't. 

The story is the best of any of the six movies. It's purposely structured. Characters have motives and the story moves along accordingly. The movies in the original trilogy had pretty loose storytelling, with just enough narrative to get from one action scene to the next. But with this movie, the story is just as important as the action. Sure there is action aplenty, but the film never loses sight of the drama.

And speaking of the drama, this movie has an abundance of it. There were only brief moments of real drama in Episodes 4, 5, and 6. Obi-Wan provided the only drama in A New Hope. The ending with Darth Vader in Episode 5 was the only thing even remotely dramatic.  And the whole, 'finding out that Vader is your father,' plot line was the drama in Return of the Jedi. But in Episode III, there is drama left and right. Anakin's premonitions, his eventual alienation from Obi-Wan and Padmé, Padmé's broken heart, and the death of the Jedi's are the driving dramatic forces of this movie. It all pulls together perfectly to form the darkest Star Wars yet.

The special effects and action completely wipe the floor with anything from the previous movies. The movie opens with a thrilling action scene on General Grievous's starship, and doesn't let up from there. Then there is the awesome battle on Utapau that contains the lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and General Grievous. And finally, the climatic duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin is positively exhilarating, powerful, epic, and satisfying. The duel has been gradually set up for the last two movies, and the payoff is well worth it. It's without a doubt the best lightsaber battle of the entire Saga. These aren't the only fantastic action scenes in the movie, but it would be monotones to praise all of these phenomenal action scenes.

None of the Star Wars movies really packed an emotional punch up to this point. But Revenge of the Sith breaks that mold. The entire last hour is a heart pounding, heart wrenching thrill ride of action and emotions. The scene where Padmé finds out that Anakin has joined the Dark Side, and Obi-Wan confronts Anakin about his new path is especially heartrending. This movie is like an emotional bulldozer. It might not be especially subtle, but it is undeniable effective. All of the rest of the Star Wars movies (except for Return of the Jedi) left me emotionally indifferent at the end. But Episode III certainly doesn't.

Ewan McGregor finally gives a performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi that exceeds Alec Guinness. I liked the character in the first two movies, but I loved him here. He is a powerful Jedi, but unlike Anakin, he wisely uses his powers for good. McGregor nails the scene right before the final lightsaber duel. It's this movie that propelled Obi-Wan over Yoda as my favorite Star Wars character.

Hayden Christianson finally portrays Anakin right. He is a dark and disturbed character, and Christianson reflects that. Anakin does some unspeakable things in this movie, but there is a clear motive for his actions. He is a morally misguided character, which makes his actions all the more frightening. Sure Christianson subpar acting does slip in here and there, but overall he is shockingly solid. His irrationality is what makes him so terrifying, something that Darth Vader never had.

Natalie Portman's role as Padmé is decreased in this movie, but she still manages to turn in her best performance as the character. The previously mentioned scene where she discovers Anakin's turn to the Dark Side is powerful. ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart! You're going down a path I cannot follow,"" gets me every time.

Ian McDiarmid deserves props for his performance as Darth Sidious. The explanation of the character and his origins are excellently done. Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu is also given a brilliant scene right before his demise.

John Williams hasn't written a bad Star Wars score. And Revenge of the Sith is another top-notch effort. Of special note is his ""Battle of the Heroes"" cue. It is breathtaking. To go along with old favorites The Imperial March and the Force theme, Williams brings back the Luke and Leia theme at the end. 

I love this movie. I would have never guessed that George Lucas would close out this franchise on such a remarkably strong note, but he does. It's a shame that Lucas choose to remind us of his ample talent as a director on the third movie of his trilogy. Revenge of the Sith is an action packed, emotionally powerful, and visually astounding conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. But then again, it's not exactly the ending to the Saga now is it! 

""Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must."" 10/10"
"Jul 04, 2013",4,I want to see and i will but the ending is so sad
"Jul 04, 2013",4,Best out of the saga
"Jul 03, 2013",4,Best of the prequels but definitely not as good as the original trilogy movies.
"Jul 01, 2013",0.5,Star war is really boring
"Jul 01, 2013",3,"Beside Hayden Christensen, the acting is good, effects are great, and the action is spectacular."
"Jul 01, 2013",3,Who knew when watching the original trilogy that Darth Vader was such a whiny  teenager.
"Jul 01, 2013",3.5,"Going into Episode III, I was weary to see more pomp and circumstance than character and genuine feeling. Happily, Episode III surprised me. For the most part (though believe me there are still some big problems), Revenge of the Sith is more character-driven than eye candy. And a hell of a lot darker, too. There's a lot more good this time around: Anakin Skywalker is overall more well-rounded than before and is clearly going down for the count. Obi-Wan is more grave and weary and Padme's story ends in a tragedy, and I actually was pretty saddened by it all, especially *SPOILERS* her funeral procession on Naboo toward the end of the film, which was just right in every way. Episode III is still filled up with tons of CGI creatures and backgrounds and one of the villains, General Grevious, is pretty pointless all around. The bar-none best part of the movie is Ian McDiarmid as the scheming, scintillating and seductive true evil center of the film, Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine. He's so good because he LOVES being evil, whereas Darth Vader obviously hated it. The epic lightsaber duel to end all lightsaber duels between Anakin/Darth Vader and Obi-wan, former friends, is great, though a little too long and goes to some ridiculous heights. Anakin/Vader's fiery defeat by Obi-Wan and the general tone of the film is probably why Revenge is rated PG-13, whereas every other Star Wars movie is PG. The movie ends on a tragic yet hopeful note and is a nice way to end the overall disappointing prequel trilogy."
"Jun 30, 2013",4,Definitely the best of the prequel s still not a touch on the originals it does give a conclusive explanation into the origins of vadar  it's a must see for Star Wars fans
"Jun 30, 2013",3,Visually stunning and a good finale to the prequel trilogy
"Jun 30, 2013",5,best sc fi movie ever made
"Jun 28, 2013",3.5,"some of the one-liners are hilariously bad, but it's still the peak of the prequel trilogy. But the prequel trilogy will never amount to the original trilogy."
"Jun 27, 2013",5,"Visually mind blowing, emotionally overwhelming."
"Jun 27, 2013",1,That ain't might my Darth Vader...what a bitch
"Jun 27, 2013",4,This incredible Star Wars film definitely surpass the previous two episode with a  darker story of how Anakin becomes Darth Vader. This is probably the best Star Wars film since Return Of The Jedi.
"Jun 27, 2013",4,Poor acting but the best one of the prequel trilogy everyone listen when it gets re released in 3d go see it it'll be worth it
"Jun 27, 2013",3.5,"the best of the first 3, might have something to do with a wonderful lack of jar jar binks. Awesome battles and fight scenes, but poor acting(with the exception of Ewan Mcgregor) and dialogue does bring the movie down."
"Jun 26, 2013",5,Good but better without the 3D. Watch the original non 3D version
"Jun 25, 2013",5,"Can't believe how great it was in 2D, but now. That's its in 3D it's outstanding!!!!!!!"
"Jun 25, 2013",5,The best Star Wars movie of all time
"Jun 23, 2013",3,"Better plot, story and acting than Eps 1 and 2."
"Jun 23, 2013",5,Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars movie ever With Breathtaking and Memroble sequences 10/10
"Jun 23, 2013",5,The only good Star Wars film in the prequel trilogy
"Jun 22, 2013",3.5,Bad but not that bad
"Jun 22, 2013",4,"The final installment of the ""Star Wars"" saga was pretty good. Of the new trilogy I would say this is my favorite. The story finally shows us Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader, the premiere and demise of General Grievous (my favorite character) and the ""end"" of the Jedi race. All in all it's a satisfying movie and I loved it since I first saw it at the midnight premiere when I was 10 years old."
"Jun 21, 2013",4,Revenge of the Sith is the best out of the new Star Wars movies. It was a good way to complete the saga.
"Jun 17, 2013",5,I think this movie is the best
"Jun 17, 2013",5,People don't give it the credit it deserves because the movies before it were it loved or hated. One of the most underrated films of all-time and one of my all-time favorite movies and could watch it a million times without getting bored of it. 5/5!
"Jun 17, 2013",4,"Awesome film, need to watch it in full again tho to give 5 stars"
"Jun 16, 2013",3.5,always entertaining!
"Jun 14, 2013",0.5,Movie stinks like George Lucas and Jar Jar Binks!!!!
"Jun 14, 2013",0.5,"The first three should NEVER have been made. Lucas should have just moved forward ONLY!

It sucked the first time.

Now it will suck in 3-D."
"Jun 14, 2013",4.5,By far one of the best out of the 6
"Jun 13, 2013",5,Favorite Star Wars movie
"Jun 13, 2013",1,Like the entire prequel trilogy--this is another failed opportunity. Not ever the much-anticipated fateful battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin can salvage this dud.
"Jun 13, 2013",3,While not as good as the original trilogy Revenge of the Sith is the best of the prequels but I'm not sure that is saying much.
"Jun 13, 2013",2.5,"Best movie from the prequels, which is like saying the crap I took yesterday smelled better the one I took on Sunday"
"Jun 12, 2013",5,The final lightsaber clash in 3D.
"Jun 12, 2013",5,"The best in the prequel series! Flawless performances, fantastic special effects, great direction, and an epic climatic battle between Vader and Obi Wan that even rivals the original series! A masterpiece from writer-director George Lucas and an exciting conclusion to the series."
"Jun 11, 2013",4,Stunning action sequences and a climactic finale punctuate this entry into the epic series.
"Jun 10, 2013",5,Loved original have not seen 3 d version thiugh
"Jun 10, 2013",3.5,"69%
Containing a better story and acting, Sith brings to life the image of the transformation of Skywalker into Vader with a much darker approach and imagination than the previous installments. Had THIS film-- just this one-- been written directed by someone else, not George, we might have had a SW movie that almost made it into the same ballpark as the original films. In fact, why didn't George just make one Star Wars prequel and given it to someone else to direct? It would have been much more satisfying than what we have to deal with now."
"Jun 10, 2013",3.5,Better than Episode II.
"Jun 10, 2013",5,Such a classic movie! One of the best.
"Jun 10, 2013",3.5,Wasn't as good as the first trilogy
"Jun 09, 2013",4,"The most accomplished of the prequels, and possibly the most important of the saga.  Visually magnificent, and emotionally charged with only spurts of the ongoing flaws showing up throughout.  III successfully ties the two trilogies together in a very satisfying way.  Lucas' last film."
"Jun 09, 2013",3.5,"Finally a prequel that comes a bit close to the charm of the original trilogy. This last Star Wars film has many lightsaber duels and some awesome war scenes, all comes to a climatic battle that leads to the original trilogy, so after this we can comeback to the awesome trilogy that started in 1977. A good sci-fi film but not even close to perfect."
"Jun 06, 2013",1.5,"The end of trilogy, that should have never been made. At least I don't have to see jar jar again."
"Jun 06, 2013",4.5,I think that this alone justifies the prequels' existence.
"Jun 06, 2013",3.5,"I like how everything tied together in the end, but the real first one is my favorite"
"Jun 06, 2013",4,"It is quite easy to deride this film like its fellow 2 prequels but Revenge of the Sith is a far far superior movie to those 2 and definitely one worthy of being considered part of the Star Wars franchise. Empire Strikes Back, New Hope or Return of the Jedi it is not and while the storyline is predictable and acting middling, the direction and drama is impeccable and provocative. This is a movie that is supposed to be epic, and is, somehow delivering emotion from its rather robotic script. Will be better appreciated years after its release."
"Jun 05, 2013",4.5,"Though most don't like it, this was my favorite Star Wars movie. I enjoyed the prequels far more than the originals. They gave the originals a background story. Oh and who gives a damn about Jar Jar. he had like what, 3 minutes of screen time? at the most? Grow up. The prequels can be hated, but for reasons other than Jar Jar. This movie of the six had the most action as well as the best special effects. I watch it quite often. It's one of my most favorite movies. Star Wars fans will like this, and newcomers to science fiction."
"Jun 05, 2013",3,feels closers to the orignals then the other ones
"Jun 05, 2013",3.5,"Revenge of the Sith is probably the best prequel film that being said the film does has its flaws mostly Hayden Christensen's dull performance up until he turned to the dark side which he was a little better but was still meh same goes with Natalie Portman she was just very boring to watch (good in Thor though :) ) Ewan mccgregor is the star here
And the action and the plot is interesting and will keep you entertained"
"Jun 04, 2013",4,My favorite part was when the whiney Anakin Skywalker was set on fire and left for dead.
"Jun 04, 2013",4.5,not the best of the 6 but it makes the cut
"Jun 04, 2013",5,i loved starwars kinda dont like it as much but still great films
"Jun 04, 2013",5,THE SHIT BITCHESSSSSSSS
"Jun 04, 2013",3,put the rest of the story together for me but not as good as return of the jedi
"Jun 03, 2013",4,i really can't see why so many people don't like this movie
"Jun 03, 2013",5,very dark and gloomy but by far one of my favorate star wars.
"Jun 03, 2013",3.5,"Episode 1 and 2 were horrible movies, but this one is surprisingly really good!"
"Jun 02, 2013",4,"Great Classic

Watch several times each year

: )"
"Jun 02, 2013",5,"If you don't like Star wars, GET OUT NOW!!!!!"
"Jun 02, 2013",1.5,Ehh as a kid it was cool but now its just shit on a disc
"Jun 01, 2013",3,At least they didn't suddenly cast Tyler Kitsch or Paul Walker as Anikin. This ship was sinking regardless. Terrible but at least not episode I or II. Nooooooooo!
"Jun 01, 2013",4.5,Awesome film and an exciting end to the classic sags! Or at least it used to be the end.
"Jun 01, 2013",4.5,"I honestly really enjoy this movie. The emotion of the final quarter makes up for the cheesiness of some of the lines. It will remain a staple of Star Wars for me, far better Phantom and Clone Wars."
"Jun 01, 2013",3.5,A pretty good movie overall with its action special effects as well as tying in the plot perfectly for the original trilogy but it still cannot make up or the other prequels
"May 31, 2013",1,I HATE THESE KINDS OF MOVIES!!!
"May 30, 2013",3,"I havent seen this one, and really dont care."
"May 29, 2013",4,"Last year, the announcement was made of the planned making of a seventh Star Wars film, one that would commence a sequel trilogy. Even though I will definitely see it, I always felt that the original series of films ended on a strong note with Revenge of the Sith and thus should remain that way. It was an unexpected return to form, this movie, that allowed many to experience something similar to what was felt when the first Star Wars was released, and while it is not quite the achievement that the original films were it is still impressive in its own right.

The opening rescue sequence commences things with the same type of high-flying adventure that has been a staple in this series, with some amazing shots and cheesy one-liners. Following this, there is noticeable shift to a more brooding tone that pervades the rest of the film and culminates in the duel between the two lead characters. While the Star Wars films have never been particularly grim or self-serious (The Empire Strikes Back is no exception), this shift is very befitting of this chapter in the saga, notably enabling for a set design that reflects what some of the characters are going through. For example, consider the conversation between Anakin and Palpatine at the opera, where one can almost feel the mounting weight of the confusion and darkness that is entering the former's life, or the brief scene in the jedi war room that conveys a sense of suspicion and paranoia. Contrary to popular belief, set designs do not always achieve this because sometimes they mainly serve the purpose of bringing the pertinent worlds to life, without regard for the characters' experiences. Such examples of this include Batman (1989), Avatar, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Mummy (1999) and, to a lesser extent, Moulin Rouge.

The bulk of Episode III's problems lie within the segment following the rescue sequence, one that runs for about a third of the film. It may surprise many, but I do not believe the main issue here is the dialogue. While it is true that there is still a more than fair number of clunky or clumsily delivered lines, the dialogue is a far less pressing issue here for three reasons. One, as Roger Ebert pointed out, the dialogue is secondary to the other aspects that make a space opera. Two, there are more well-written scenes and sequences, such as when Sidious reveals himself to Anakin. Three, many of the strongest moments, interestingly, employ no dialogue (I will expand on that shortly). The most prominent problem is the editing during the aforementioned segment. While I did not notice it the first time seeing the film, many of the scenes are choppy and the transitions between them are too frequent. This brings a brisk pace that can make it difficult to fully take in what is transpiring on screen. Even so, once the film reaches its half-way point it quickly gains momentum and never lets up from there. 

There are many chapters that are masterful in their conception, some of the best examples of which are nearly devoid of dialogue and concentrate more on allowing the audience to ponder what has happened. One of the standouts, that I have virtually never heard anyone acknowledge, is the scene where Anakin and Padme look to each other from different buildings across the city. There is an almost haunting feel here that perfectly conveys the gravity of the situation at hand, bolstered excellently by the sunset hue and eerie vocalization. The execution of the jedi is another such example, one that derives much of its strength from principle rather than a true connection with the characters. Regardless, it is still an exceptionally well-made sequence that shows the unfolding of a terrible event, made more poignant by the harmony between the images and soundtrack. In fact, the musical score, which is just as important an element of a Star Wars film as any, does a consistently excellent job of complementing the action on screen.

As was the case in the original Star Wars, George Lucas borrows freely from classic stories and mythology, in this case Shakespearean tragedies. This was attempted in Episode II, with some obvious references to Romeo and Juliet, but was deemed a general misfire due to the lack of dramatic elements. Here, though, things are very different, as effective use is made of these allusions, particularly from Othello, to bring dramatic weight and intrigue to these final revelations on the history of Darth Vader. From these, the villain becomes more humanized than ever before, gaining the image of a conflicted man who pushes away those who care about him and has to live with the consequences of his actions until the end. Whether it plays out with air tight realism is irrelevant. What matters is whether the drama can affect the audience and in my case it did. I have been told by many concerning the sense of silliness that they perceive in the film. All I have to say about that is, ""Of course, all of the Star Wars films have this to one degree or another."" None of them are down to earth and gritty, but some are more intense than others simply because the nature of their place in the overall story demands it.

Another notable asset comes from the performances. Granted, many of the actors either still lack conviction or are unfortunately underused, but this is marginally understandable given what the intended focus of the film is. Even so, there are some very good performances, chief of which being that of Ian MacDiarmid as the sinister Palpatine. Ewan McGregor is underappreciated as Obi-Wan, as he brings a convincing sense of concern, self-mastery and somberness to the character that has been gradually built from what we saw before. This can be seen in several of the conversations between Obi-Wan and various other characters. As for Hayden Christensen, his performance admittedly is not up to par with what should be expected from this film series, but it is at the least convincing. You can very much believe that this is a conflicted man torn by his loyalties and consumed by hatred and fear, even though much of the impact comes by virtue of this tale's identity as Darth Vader's backstory.

The climax is one of the strongest of the saga, definitely in the top three, with the other two being from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The prelude on the landing platform brings emotional resonance to the action and the setting of a volcanic planet remains impressive no matter how many times the film is seen. I am of the opinion that climactic conflicts are most effective when they are personal, between about two combatants as opposed to grand in scale. This allows there to be a connection between the combatants that can be seen by the audience and brings greater dramatic weight to the action. Other good examples of this include Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Last of the Mohicans, Batman Begins, The Prince of Egypt and Frost/Nixon. As James Berardinelli made note of, there is also brilliant employment of the parallel action editing that was first seen in Return of the Jedi and again in The Phantom Menace. Here, it is first seen between two lightsaber duels then, more poignantly, between the placing of Darth Vader in the suit and the death of Padme after giving birth to the twins. 

As far as space operas are concerned, this is the best to come from the 2000's. One of the primary aims of the prequel trilogy was to bring new life and perspective to the original story and with this final installment that goal is mostly met. Such moments as the duel between Obi-Wan and Vader aboard the Death Star and Obi-Wan's passing mention of the destruction of the jedi now bring a slew of new connections and images to mind. For this, these films merit some appreciation. I am currently in a state of uncertainty regarding the planned sequel trilogy, which has the potential to be excellent or a catastrophe. Regardless, I am glad that we will still have this film to remember as the one that brought the story of one of cinema's greatest villains full circle."
"May 28, 2013",3,Meh.. lightsaber duel was cool other than that.. NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
"May 28, 2013",1,soz but h8 star wars 4 sum reason lol:(
"May 27, 2013",5,Saw all the movies. This one is by far best.
"May 27, 2013",5,best of the prequels. so much drama and the music was a perfect fit to the end of perhaps the most iconic trilogy of all time. also it was the birth of darth vader
"May 27, 2013",0.5,how does this have an 80% on the meter?
"May 26, 2013",2.5,"A loud, dark, long, violent, and ultimately silly conclusion to the trilogy of Star Wars prequels."
"May 26, 2013",0.5,not really into star wars
"May 26, 2013",5,"Can't wait for episode 7,8 and 9 to come out.  I never thought I will ever see another star war trilogy in my life time 2017 can't wait"
"May 25, 2013",5,It looks a good movie.I think you must see this movie.It is a must see movie.
"May 25, 2013",5,Absolutely love all the Star Wars   movies!
"May 25, 2013",5,I was sad to see it and I wish towards Lucas would have made the other three films he claimed he never wrote which I met him and I know he did anyway great seeing you guys thanks for the all these movies
"May 24, 2013",4,"Such a great movie, especially because things that matter to the story finally occur. The graphics and acting were fairly good, but the story telling and fight scenes is what stood out to me. Of Episodes I-III this one is by far the best &amp; it was pretty serious and epic. Aside from the sappy love scenes and a few parts they could've left out it was a great addition to the Star Wars franchise!"
"May 24, 2013",3.5,"Worst of the the franchise. Still pretty good, though. Kinda depressing."
"May 24, 2013",4,Was a good night waiting to see the movie. Bad Morning dealing with the parents.
"May 23, 2013",4.5,Star Wars rocks my socks.
"May 22, 2013",1,next to dumbest thing i've seen...
"May 22, 2013",4,"It has its moments filled with cheesy dialogue and stiff acting., but this did the best it could and actually achieved to get some of the emotional drama that the originals contained.  With stunning action sequences, and a very intense turn from Anakin Skywalker to one of the greatest cinematic villains of all time, the destination was worth it. Best of the prequel trilogy!"
"May 22, 2013",5,It had lightsabers in it. End of discussion!
"May 21, 2013",1,"my god, why did we deserve this"
"May 20, 2013",3.5,Felt like it was the end of an era. Kept thinking that there wouldn't be any more SW.
"May 20, 2013",4,"the best of the prequels, we see how anakin is brain washed by the sith, a very entertaining and informative film"
"May 20, 2013",3.5,not as good as the first trilogy and doesnt needa remake.
"May 20, 2013",3,Enjoyed this. Believe it could have been even darker though!
"May 20, 2013",5,"After reading every post ANH book in the expanded universe, I watched this film again, and was amazed to discover that every single line of this film served to connect the dots of past-to-future canon.  It was so precisely and carefully crafted, so as more a chronicle than anything else, a true masterpiece of craft."
"May 20, 2013",4,"it is prettyy good the best new star wars , scary humorus and exciting"
"May 19, 2013",4.5,Fantastic A great movie that star wars fans had been waiting for with real dialogue a real story to tell intense action and fantastic performances make this not only the best of the prequal trilogy but the best Star Wars film since The Empire Strikes Back
"May 19, 2013",4,The best ending of the prequels.
"May 19, 2013",3.5,"I love the special effects, good movie"
"May 19, 2013",3.5,"no empire or new hope,best of prequels"
"May 19, 2013",4.5,"Sadly, I have to say that it may not be the best of the six films, but I still had goosebumps when Darth Vader first appears. Most mature performance of the prequels. Let's just wait for the two new TV shows"
"May 18, 2013",5,Best Star Wars made!!
"May 18, 2013",2.5,never was a big fan of star wars
"May 18, 2013",5,"By far, the best of the 6 films."
"May 17, 2013",3,"not into starwars, it was excited in the 70s"
"May 17, 2013",5,A good end to the Star Wars prequels good great acting and had the Star Wars fans questions answered five stars
"May 17, 2013",5,"the darkest of the Star Wars movies and quite possibly the best. More drama, and action than any of the others. the further the movie goes, the more spot on the dialogue gets."
"May 17, 2013",4,Great Light Saber fights
"May 17, 2013",4.5,"Hayden Christiansen is still the wrong choice for Anakin, but this epic conclusion to the prequel trilogy brings the entire series full circle with its breathtaking attention to characters and, of course, the always fascinating Star Wars universe. Its a darker take than any of the previous films, but it succeeds in its ability to be dark and violent without being self-indulgent or treating the darker content as action or entertainment. This is a genuinely great movie."
"May 16, 2013",4,Best of the prequels...
"May 16, 2013",4,Star Wars is always amazing!
"May 16, 2013",4,"The saga is now complete. The circle is now complete. When I left you I was but the learner, now I am the master. The prequel trilogy comes to a close and we finally see the fall and rise of the notorious villain, Darth Vader. 
The movie takes place three years after Attack of the Clones and war has been going on. Chancellor Palpatine is kidnapped by the droid army general, General Grievous and it's up to Obi Won Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to rescue him and our movie begins.
You get a 22 min action piece which is fairly good and then the story unfolds and when you finally see Skywalker become the villain it's kinda shocking. You know it was going to happen but it just still feels weird, like why Anakin. 
The movie is great and far the best one outa the prequel trilogy and the first PG-13 one as well. I loved when I first saw it back in 2005 and still love it today in 2013.
Oh and you thought this series was over? Thanks to Lucas selling the company to Disney were getting Star Wars Episode VII in 2015. Till next time for the galaxy far far away.."
"May 15, 2013",5,Anakon goes mad and kills the little jedi best part!
"May 14, 2013",4,Definitely the best of the prequels.
"May 14, 2013",2,never followed the same age group as in tended when when star wars first became a hit it went from a very adult type film to a chieldrens movie/film but interesting to see the whole story
"May 13, 2013",4,Not as good as the rest but still briliant
"May 13, 2013",3.5,"Much better than Episodes I and II. Thank goodness. Dialogue could've used a lot of work, but hey!"
"May 13, 2013",5,The best in the series.
"May 13, 2013",3,"Kinda cool, but the acting Sucked, very pretty tho :)"
"May 12, 2013",3.5,"George Lucas is a technical genius, but he is not efficient enough as a director or screenwriter to be put in charge of such positions. ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is mostly a good film (largely due to its spectacular final forty or so minutes), but it fails in a lot of areas due to Lucas' poor handling of his own mediocre script. The whole thing has the look and feel of one of those melodramatic television soap operas until about an hour in, which is where the storytelling is kicked into first gear and the film takes off. There's a lot of action, a lot of drama and a lot of bad lines, but overall, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is exciting and ties both ""Star Wars"" trilogies together quite nicely."
"May 12, 2013",3.5,"I know people will hate me for saying this, but in my opinion the best of all the Star Wars movies. I really enjoyed watching Anakin Skywalker transition from a Jedi to Darth Vader, and the light saber battles were spectacular. That opening scene with the huge battle and the fight with General Grevious was amazing."
"May 11, 2013",3,Nice lead up to the original
"May 11, 2013",3.5,A return to form for the franchise.
"May 11, 2013",5,One of the greatest movie i have ever seen and my favorite Thank you Mr Lucas Thank You
"May 10, 2013",4,"I grew up with the original Star Wars and of course thought they were the greatest thing I had ever seen. Episode I is still my favorite, though. The only thing that would have made this and other Star Wars movies better is a different director. George Lucas is a genius, but he unfortunately can't direct very well. 

Can't wait for new episodes."
"May 10, 2013",4,Best in the saga in my opinion.  Matches up perfect with the originals!
"May 09, 2013",4,"Great, waited almost 30 years to see Aniken Skywalker go bad. But should've been in the Darth Vader costume way earlier in the movie."
"May 08, 2013",3,Better than the previous prequels.
"May 08, 2013",5,Been a Star Wars fan since the first one came out in '77.  My father took me then and we've seen them all since.  This one we went to the theater on father's day.  Great way to end the epic.
"May 08, 2013",4,By far the best of the prequel trilogy
"May 08, 2013",3,ive always found starts wars kinda cheesy but this one is good
"May 06, 2013",3.5,The best star wars prequel but it does not reach the level of the original trilogy.The script still didn't make any sense.Some of the dialogue was dull.Some of the characters were stupid and the acting wasn't fair.The effects and the action scenes were very impressive but this movie still is not GREAT.
"May 06, 2013",3.5,Revenge of the Sith is the best of the newer trilogy. I'm happy that they finished off the series on a good note.
"May 06, 2013",1,The only reason I will watch this again is becasuse Hayden Christensen is HOTT!!
"May 05, 2013",2,Totally the wrong people for this movie.
"May 05, 2013",4.5,I give this 5.2 out of 5 gold bricks
"May 05, 2013",4,its a star wars film
"May 05, 2013",3.5,"Definately not my favourite Star Wars film, probably my 2nd least favourite - behind Attack of the Clones. Good ending to the Story which pieces together everything from the previous films. Lucas was not at his best with this one, although the new characters were clever and unique."
"May 05, 2013",4.5,it was ok not what I thought it would be
"May 05, 2013",2.5,Better than the other 2 but still horrid acting.
"May 05, 2013",4.5,good times i love the wars
"May 04, 2013",5,loved this movie... only seen it once... want to see it again
"May 03, 2013",5,best of all the star wars movies
"May 03, 2013",5,I just love star wars! Destroy the Sith we must! Got Force?
"May 03, 2013",4.5,I can't believe Anakin became Darth Vader. How could he?!
"May 03, 2013",5,Seriously I need 4D. I want to be there an experience the true power of the Dark Side!!
"May 02, 2013",1,"CGI bucocky fest, still plagued with bad righting and acting with Gorge Lucas killing the love of his old fans just to try and make more money with basically toy advertisements... For a third time! Well at least its the last one of the trilogy and he can stop making his fans mad, especially since Disney bought the rights from him, but if iron man 3 is any prof how disney will treat a franchise us star wars fans could be let down again, For now hes trying to make money with the 3D bandwagon folks... WTF Gorge?!"
"May 01, 2013",3.5,This movie was a great final installment in the prequel trilogy and had great fight sequences
"May 01, 2013",5,Star Wars Revenge of the Sith is one of my favorite movies!!! I really like and enjoy the action while I'm watching this movie too!!!!!!
"May 01, 2013",3.5,Could've been better.
"May 01, 2013",5,"Really excellent, right up there with episodes 4, 5 &amp; 6"
"May 01, 2013",3,"It does a lot of things better than the other two prequels, and it's just barely not great, but the characters still aren't that interesting. Everything else is pretty good if you ask me"
"May 01, 2013",4,"Best of the prequels...good action, great transition to Darth and the New Hope."
"Apr 30, 2013",3,a lot better than the other 2 and has some cool fights
"Apr 29, 2013",4.5,"I am now half-way through my Star Wars Marathon by finishing the Prequel Trilogy with Revenge of the Sith.

If there is one film that I feel gets too much undeserved hate from people, it's this film. Sure, there are some occasional moments where the dialogue and acting don't always shine, but in my opinion, the good stuff in Episode III FAR outweighs the bad.

Let's talk about the good stuff. We start off with the opening scene, which was fantastic. The CGI is great, there is a nice continuous take at the beginning, the journey getting to Emperor Palpatine was exciting, the aircraft action is intense and the lightsaber fights are a lot of fun, especially with Count Dooku.

Not only that, we get what is by far the most compelling story in the prequels. Seeing this war ensue and watching Palpatine turn the allies of the Republic against each other is very engaging and intense. 

We also have an engrossing character arc with Anakin turning over to the dark side and I also really appreciate George Lucas not sugar-coating the fact that Anakin has now turned evil with the deeds he commits and the stare he has.

Little scenes like the moment of silence when Anakin and Padme are looking out the window was emotionally stirring and the segment when Palpatine explains to Anakin about Darth Plagueis is drenched in atmosphere and intrigue.

Ian McDiarmid is great as Emperor Palpatine as is Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen does a more convincing role as Anakin this time around.

Also, John Williams score is simply amazing and it accompanies the emotional and intense moments extremely well. 

Most of the action is riveting in this film. From the aforementioned beginning sequence, to the duel between Obi-Wan and General Grievous and the climatic battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan is the definition of epic.

I also really like the way it concludes the trilogy by connecting the original trilogy with the birth of Darth Vader and the two children; Luke and Leia.

Overall, Revenge of the Sith may not be perfect, but the stuff that's good is just too good to overlook. 

My favourite Star Wars Prequel by far!"
"Apr 29, 2013",5,Its fucking Star Wars...I don't care how bad it really was.
"Apr 28, 2013",4.5,brilliant!!! loved it best of the lot!
"Apr 27, 2013",3.5,"This is the the best of the prequels no doubt, its also a pretty solid movie"
"Apr 26, 2013",5,Aaron and I have saw all these movies.Love IT!
"Apr 26, 2013",1.5,can some one say boring
"Apr 26, 2013",4.5,"It's star wars, enough said"
"Apr 26, 2013",3,The best prequel. Still not a good movie.
"Apr 26, 2013",2,It is boring if you don't understand what they are doing
"Apr 26, 2013",5,Best movie in the world!!!!!
"Apr 26, 2013",3.5,"The third time is the charm as George Lucas hits it with star wars revenge of the sith, although it's not perfect, it's gold compared to the other movies from the prequels. It somewhat captures the environment and it has some cool actions scenes. Overall the best movie from the unecessary prequels."
"Apr 25, 2013",3.5,"i always enjoyed the star wars sires, but i knew it had to end this way"
"Apr 25, 2013",5,one of the best movies of all time.
"Apr 24, 2013",3.5,"Once the various stories are tied together, there are several uneven, frayed plot lines."
"Apr 24, 2013",5,hayden is so cute and talanted
"Apr 24, 2013",4,the best of the star war films
"Apr 24, 2013",4,good film great effects but still not as good as the originals
"Apr 23, 2013",0.5,"Finally! It's over. So, the question to be asked about this film is...""Is it any better than the first two prequels?"" To which, I reply with a giant ""Nooooooooooo!"" This movie is filled with plot holes. Some huge plot holes. Once again it is terribly acted, terribly directed, and the script is rushed. With this movie, it REALLY felt like Lucas just wanted to animate the entire movie. Like in the last film, there is an EXTREME overuse of CGI. These prequels were made to sell toys, which I guess they did. And while, at some points in the movie it seems like the visuals are great, for the most part they aren't. And some people seem to think that this is a great movie because the visuals look okay sometimes, that doesn't make a film good. In this film, Lucas backtracks the entire last movie as well as this movie itself. And while the overall tone of the movie is supposed to be dark, watch just the first scene and tell me what the tone of the movie will be. Who knows? Is it funny? Is it exciting? Is it dark? Is it boring? Is it adventurous? Is it happy? Is it sad? Is it lighthearted? Um, I don't know. The opening scene of a movie should establish a tone. This movie doesn't. This movie feels like it was made on an assembly line. That is this movie."
"Apr 23, 2013",5,Really the best Iron Man
"Apr 22, 2013",3.5,Very emotional ending to the series.
"Apr 22, 2013",5,George  Lucas  did it again.
"Apr 22, 2013",5,best of the six. I know that's almost like blasphemy. But I am a real fan and I understand Star Wars better than most things. This movie is the best of all six films.
"Apr 21, 2013",3,"Quite good, but has a terrible ending with Padme and the robot midwife."
"Apr 21, 2013",5,"100% 10/10

More action
Better acting
Okay ending

None"
"Apr 21, 2013",1,Not as good as the original series
"Apr 18, 2013",5,Best of the prequels.
"Apr 18, 2013",3,While it has a rich mythology to compensate. III almost suffers from unbearable performances and dialogue.
"Apr 17, 2013",0.5,"With the benefit of time, I have come to realize this as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It fails technically with the nearly sole reliance on CGI for effects, making the film look like a bad cartoon. It fails at building characters, who all feel like caricatures of staid fantasy archetypes. It fails at dialogue, which sounds like 10th grade melodrama. It fails at basic storytelling, with the complex plot having no relation to anything interesting. There is a reason The Empire Strikes Back is regarded as the best SW movie: Lucas neither wrote nor directed it."
"Apr 17, 2013",5,great movie..  of course not without its flaws.  we could have lived without the Nooooo
"Apr 17, 2013",5,for me the best of the prequels and maybe the best of the series aswell! highlight being obi-wan and anakins showdown!
"Apr 16, 2013",3.5,the only prequel worth waiting for
"Apr 16, 2013",4,good movie.  Go Darth Vader
"Apr 16, 2013",5,Best modern Star Wars
"Apr 16, 2013",4,"If I thought I killed Natalie Portman, I'd join the dark side too."
"Apr 15, 2013",4,"This is one of the best Star Wars fims i think. It has a very good twist and end to the story, and it begins another series of films that are really good! I think it can make you cry and that is something special."
"Apr 15, 2013",3,These were very hyped up at the time of release
"Apr 14, 2013",1,it was kinda confusin.. but okay.
"Apr 14, 2013",5,"Definately the best of the prequels, bringing us back to the spirit of the original trilogy while at the same time, giving us a darker, more menacing tone."
"Apr 14, 2013",4,Excelente. La mejor de las tres primeras y sin duda al nivel de las originales
"Apr 14, 2013",3.5,Good film but a bit disappointed about the ending.
"Apr 14, 2013",2.5,Theses aren't as good as the first three. It's not as good as I and II.
"Apr 13, 2013",4.5,"Out of the first ""3"" Star Wars films which are actually just prequels this is the only half way decent movie, but even though it's still Star Wars!"
"Apr 12, 2013",4,ties up almost all the loose ends going into the original.
"Apr 12, 2013",4,I like the idea and the story isn't too great but i can live with it! Its a nice and emotional ending to see how Darth Vader is created! its very cool and the characters are pretty good maybe some more work but it is very nice and Lucas did a pretty good job with this movie.
"Apr 12, 2013",2.5,"Episodes I and II were bad so episode III should be bad right?  Well you're damn well right there, kind of.  Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is just like the previous two prequels complex, a vast collection of boring to terrible acting, over use of special effects, and the list goes on.  However, surprisingly enough it is actually watchable this time around for the most part.  It still borrows to much from the original trilogy, still has obvious parts that sells toys to kids, and is a joke but in no way like Episode II was.  This time at least it attempts to keep the audience interested and it does for about 40% of the movie espically the final half hour which is actually fairly interesting, and to its credit the ending is good if not nearly perfect.  Nevertheless, Episode III is no were near perfect, but at least it kind of ends on a high note.  Don't get me wrong it's still bad but compared to its predecessors its a  fair film, but not enough to make up for the prequels.  2.5/5"
"Apr 11, 2013",3.5,Could have been better.
"Apr 11, 2013",3,"It's no Jedi, but it'll do"
"Apr 11, 2013",4,Excellent movie! the light sabre fight between obi wan and darth make the movie! and the soundtrack rocks!
"Apr 11, 2013",5,come on its star wars
"Apr 10, 2013",5,It was the best one of the 3
"Apr 10, 2013",4.5,Luuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuv it!!
"Apr 10, 2013",4,pretty coool amazing graphics
"Apr 09, 2013",3.5,"Out of the prequel trilogy, Episode III is by far the best. While it could have been done better, it does tie all the storylines together nicely and along the way you get to see the birth of one of cinemas most famous icons."
"Apr 09, 2013",1,George Lucas needs to stop.
"Apr 09, 2013",2.5,Best of the new three. But not a patch on Empire Strikes Back
"Apr 09, 2013",2,George Lucas has said that the Star Wars films are known for their comedy! Hmmm yeah right. The original three movies rate a lot higher than the latter three that were made.
"Apr 09, 2013",5,"incredible, keeps up the legacy of star wars"
"Apr 09, 2013",1.5,"Tied the story together, but in doing that; wasn't a good film!"
"Apr 08, 2013",3.5,Scattered moments of terrible dialogue ruin what might have been a strong conclusion to the series.
"Apr 08, 2013",4,return of the jedi is flawless
"Apr 08, 2013",4,I like it :) I like all star wars :)
"Apr 08, 2013",3.5,quite good but more effects would have been good
"Apr 08, 2013",4,Just because Yoda kicks arse!
"Apr 08, 2013",3.5,better than 1 and 2 but the old trilogy were much better
"Apr 08, 2013",5,"YAY!! w00t, go star wars! LOVE IT!"
"Apr 08, 2013",3,it was quite good but wouldnt be my first choice of film
"Apr 08, 2013",3,"Best of the prequels because for a few brief moments, it actually feels like a Star wars movie."
"Apr 07, 2013",4.5,"Visually a masterpiece. The action is great and the acting gets the job done. This one completes the saga, the ending will leave you depressed though. Until you watch episode IV."
"Apr 07, 2013",2.5,I Make fun of this Movie far too much
"Apr 07, 2013",4,"Well that's much more like it!! It's still bogged down by cheesy moments, but this is a much more well written, much darker and engaging movie than the other prequels. Anakin's character arc is fascinating, and the movie hits all the right emotional beats. And the last 5 or so minutes? Nostalgia BOMB. 
8 out of 10"
"Apr 06, 2013",4,the star wars is a story that never ends the way its supposed  to the third one is how darth vader and anakin skywalker became one.
"Apr 06, 2013",5,BEST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER!!!!
"Apr 06, 2013",4.5,"Very nearly as great as the original trilogy, Revenge of the Sith is also the best of the Star Wars prequels by far due to its amazing effects, exhilarating action sequences, and startlingly powerful narrative."
"Apr 06, 2013",4,"Star Wars Episode III receives a lot of flak. Some of it is deserved, in my mind mostly because Hayden Christensen isn't quite convincing as a lover, and his pledge to the Dark Side is one of the goofier moments of the film (though to be fair, part of that is a writing problem, not a Hayden problem).

On the other hand, there is lots to like. Ep. 3 gives us the greatest battle scenes and the most alien planets in the franchise. It feels like this is the direction Star Wars wanted to go with the whole prequel trilogy (and got right with Kamino and the Darth Maul battle).

Most heartbreaking, too, is the story, no matter how goofily written parts of it may be. Anakin Skywalker has dreams that his secret wife will die, and the last time he had such dreams, his mom did die. He finds a source of hope in the Dark Lord of the Sith, and the movie chronicles his tragic--and ironic--fall. Making it only even more epic is the backdrop of the parallel story line in the fall of the Republic, which, as Tolkien observed, is not so much an allegory as a story with applications.

Overall, Revenge of the Sith is the satisfying climax to the Star Wars prequel trilogy."
"Apr 06, 2013",4.5,"Hayden Christensen may unfortunately sometimes lack the strength to carry the dramatic demands required of his role in the second-half of the piece, but George Lucas' final instalment in the 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy is a fast-paced, action-packed adventure. 

John Williams' score is particularly effective in propelling the story forward, adding depth to the demise of the Jedis as well as the fight sequences. Yoda (Frank Oz) also gets a large share of the action and the computer-generated master doesn't disappoint when pitted against Chancellor Palpatine (a wicked Ian McDiarmid). 

What 'Revenge of the Sith' does especially well is not only set up the following three films, but also leaves its audience greatly anticipating them. 

A highly entertaining and consistently captivating addition to the popular franchise."
"Apr 05, 2013",4,"The Star Wars series, after two prequels, finally hits the intended form that the original three have set, with this movie. It is imperative that you should see this movie, as all the loose ends are about to be tied up for the three movies - that are now known as sequels in episode number order."
"Apr 05, 2013",3.5,Ending could have been longer.
"Apr 05, 2013",2.5,"The Jedi hop around like supermen and the battles have no context, making the weight and sense of dire virtually non-existent. We aren't invested in the story because it's written poorly and promulgates no sense of real danger. Everyone always lands too perfectly from their falls. Scenes made entirely of CGI fakery sterilize the once gritty, high-stakes world of a ""Star Wars"" long forgotten in the mind of its creator."
"Apr 05, 2013",0.5,"I don't like any of the new star wars movies , but I gave this half a star for being the least lame out of the three."
"Apr 05, 2013",2.5,"when everyone said lucas was a dried up hack, he screamed no at them and then that they underestimated his power, he then jumped in lava, like this movie"
"Apr 04, 2013",5,Classic movie love it
"Apr 04, 2013",5,That has to be one of my favorite movies in the entire world! I love Anakin!
"Apr 04, 2013",1.5,sad intense and over the top the opposite to a new hope
"Apr 04, 2013",4,Fan of the original Trilogy.
"Apr 04, 2013",1.5,"""Revenge of the Sith"" is what I call ""Star Wars: Apathy Reigns Supreme."" I call it that because after watching the extremely disappointing ""Phantom Menace"" and the god-awful, worse than the 1st prequel ""Attack of the Clones,"" I didn't seem to really much about what would happen in this film because WE ALL know what happens before ""A New Hope."" The Emperor is the only character worth watching, the fighting is a choreographed light show which just removes the significance and respect for light saber battles, General Grievous is another cartoonish character we can't care about,  and Hayden Christensen is once again playing a man-child whose fall from grace we could care less about because he's STILL A WHINER. 1 and a half stars; to say that this is the best of the prequel trilogy is like comparing human disasters because no matter how much is loss, IT'S STILL HORRIBLE."
"Apr 03, 2013",5,IT WAS AMAZNG! THE BEST MOVIE OUT OF THE 6
"Apr 02, 2013",4,i didn't lik him turning evil
"Apr 02, 2013",4,Could have been done better
"Apr 02, 2013",4.5,"loved it, my favorite of the six"
"Apr 02, 2013",5,Star Wars - Awesome all round. Nuff said!
"Apr 01, 2013",2.5,"Best of the prequel trilogy, but this movie still has lost potential and very cheesy dialogue. It's an okay pop corn flick, but a kick to the face for diehard Star Wars fans."
"Apr 01, 2013",4,"The final Star Wars is here and I'm happy in a positive way.

Revenge of the Sith provides what the other two prequels lacked, everything. The acting is so much better along with the dialogue and plot. This Star Wars movie in my opinion is one of the better ones, even surpassing Return of the Jedi! The visual effects are highly impressive and just a good movie.

This is by far the best of the prequel trilogy and I give it a 8.5 out of 10"
"Mar 31, 2013",1.5,still sucked. even with natalie portman in it. i guess i'm just not into star wars movies made in the twentyfirst century
"Mar 31, 2013",1.5,"Was an OK film, but was ruined at the end by a loud NOOOO from pussy darth vader."
"Mar 31, 2013",2.5,"Best of the prequels, but Christensen's poor ability to communicate the depths of Anakin Skywalker's fall and Lucas's inability to do something great without any special effects still leaves much to be desired."
"Mar 31, 2013",3,ok a little depressing for me but the graphics are good
"Mar 31, 2013",3.5,"Good wrap up to the first three eps. Lots of nice effects, although it seems like he was just throwing them around in this one."
"Mar 31, 2013",4.5,Not as good as the originals but i love star wars
"Mar 31, 2013",1,dont like space movies
"Mar 31, 2013",5,Incredible third entry!!
"Mar 30, 2013",4,My fav of the three new (older) Star Wars flix...
"Mar 30, 2013",5,"Hello its a bam bam!!  love it , but they need to redo the old one"
"Mar 30, 2013",1,Can't for the life of me understand Star Wars.  I have tried.  Just not my thing.
"Mar 30, 2013",1,"Boring, soap-opera stuff; nowhere close to as good as episodes 4, 5, 6."
"Mar 30, 2013",4,"the best of the newer trilogy by far. i loved star wars so much as a kid it was hard for any of the newer ones to live up to my expectations. if i didn't have such a fantasized biased towards the originals and could some how watch this objectively i might say this is the best star wars period. it has the best drama, too bad hayden christensen sucks so bad. if it weren't for him this might have been my favorite movie ever."
"Mar 29, 2013",5,My kids have seen it.
"Mar 29, 2013",4,It was ok. 1 &amp; 2 were better
"Mar 29, 2013",2,"While the special effects are excellent, Episode III fails to improve upon its predecessors mistakes."
"Mar 29, 2013",5,one of the 6 greatest films made
"Mar 29, 2013",3,"agree with Desson's review of ""Revenge"". While ""Revenge was better than the prior Prequels, ""Revenge"" did not stack up with the original trilogy at all, which is what all prequels, sequels, and spin-offs are invariably compared to. ""Revenge""s main problem was casting. Hayden Christensen looked too young and charming to become Darth Vader the diabolical villain of the original trilogy. Natalie Portman was not convincing as Padme Amidala. Not once did I ever feel like there was a romantic connection between Anakin and Padme. One of the main problems with the prequels was that there was no way there could be any surprises. The point of the prequels was to thoroughly explain which leaves no room for plot twists comparable to Darth's ""No, I am your Father."" There were problems with the relationships created between characters as well. In the final fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan, the ""Duel of Fates"", two close friends were supposed to be shown severing their ties for their respective side of the force. However, this intended feeling was not present because the prior movies did not create enough of a bond between the two ""besties"". There were not enough accounts of their trials and tribulations which lead to close relationships; there were only references."
"Mar 28, 2013",5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE! :)
"Mar 28, 2013",2,don't really like this movie
"Mar 28, 2013",2.5,"Although revenge of the sith can not even begin to compete with the original trilogy, it was the best of the prequels. I think by itself the movie was wonderful. Even if the first half was slow moving right around the duel with palpetine and mace windu the movie really had a pace. The CGI was also very well done I really appreciated the scenes on utapau and kashyyyk. Overall quite a good movie!"
"Mar 27, 2013",2.5,"again, not bad but it's getting old."
"Mar 27, 2013",5,Great movie and effects!  the battle of the heroes was awesome.
"Mar 27, 2013",3,Held my interest and I still think George Lucas is a whore.
"Mar 27, 2013",1.5,"'Revenge of the Sith' is a silly, poorly directed conclusion to the abysmal---and completely unnecessary--- Star Wars prequel trilogy."
"Mar 27, 2013",0.5,Can watch at home on spike for free it would be ignorant to pay and see this oooo but its in 3D who cares
"Mar 25, 2013",3,"I'm not really into the whole ""Star Wars"" fad, but I do appreciate the films, but I do have films I like better"
"Mar 25, 2013",5,i thought this was awesome and darth sidious was perfect
"Mar 25, 2013",5,it wasnt my fave but it was awsome
"Mar 25, 2013",0.5,Worst starwars ever...
"Mar 25, 2013",4,i'm not really a bug star wars fan but this movie was really good!
"Mar 25, 2013",3.5,Suffered from High Expectations. Anakin shouldah won.
"Mar 24, 2013",3.5,Too many fight scenes. And CGI. Not enough character interaction
"Mar 24, 2013",3,Good but the oldies are better
"Mar 24, 2013",4,The best of the prequels.
"Mar 24, 2013",5,up to star wars standard hope they make another episode
"Mar 24, 2013",1.5,"Great effects, but poor script"
"Mar 23, 2013",2,whatever...these movies pissed me off.
"Mar 23, 2013",1,Don't even ASK my opinion on Episodes I &amp; II
"Mar 23, 2013",5,"Nothing can ever beat Star Wars, what's his name playing Anakin could've been better if someone else played the part"
"Mar 23, 2013",4,"It's the best of the prequel films, even if the writing and acting are still not that great."
"Mar 23, 2013",4.5,"Great movie, good acting, and by far the best movie in the new triliogy"
"Mar 23, 2013",4,"Probably the best of the prequels. While still containing the stink of the films before it, there are some elements that have vastly improved since the first prequel."
"Mar 22, 2013",5,I like all Star Wars movies
"Mar 22, 2013",5,greatest star wars movie ever!
"Mar 22, 2013",4.5,A fitting finish to the series
"Mar 22, 2013",4,"A nice surprise after the massively confusing and emotionally empty Phantom Menace &amp; Attack of the Clones.  Not only are the battles and visuals at their absolute peak, the story is actually straightforward &amp; understandable, and I cared about the main characters for the first time.  However, numerous plot holes remain and become increasingly obvious if one thinks about the film too much after seeing it."
"Mar 22, 2013",3.5,I'm a junkie. LOVE the effects.
"Mar 22, 2013",3.5,My pick for Best Star Wars...
"Mar 22, 2013",5,OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Mar 22, 2013",5,Watch it all the time! brought everything together nicely!
"Mar 21, 2013",4,Can't go wrong with Star Wars.
"Mar 21, 2013",5,YEs Yes Yes. I am a huge Star Wars nerd.
"Mar 21, 2013",5,"A masterpiece, pure and simple.  Wooden acting can't bring down the action sequences."
"Mar 21, 2013",5,A great movie very very tense and emotional
"Mar 20, 2013",5,the best movie ever!.... you can never watch it too many times
"Mar 20, 2013",2,"i like action packed movies, its kinda fake but it has a more of an energetic approach unlike the lord of the rings which is more mysterious"
"Mar 20, 2013",4.5,What is with people and hating the prequels I thought they were great. So did plenty of other people have the reviewers just want to agree with Rotten Tomatoes.
"Mar 19, 2013",5,"awesome, loved them all.."
"Mar 19, 2013",0.5,would have been better if they changed who played Aniken...cause Haiden can't act worth shit.
"Mar 19, 2013",4.5,It was AMAZING!! That's it!
"Mar 19, 2013",3,I think hayden was so effing hott in this movie... yeah i like SW but i am not in to it like some people are... i just like the movies
"Mar 19, 2013",3,"Kind of too evil for me, but if your into that sort of thing yeah it's a good movie."
"Mar 19, 2013",4.5,"This was the most action oriented Star Wars movie, which is saying alot since they're all action movies."
"Mar 18, 2013",4.5,Great way to end the series.
"Mar 18, 2013",1,not that interesting..
"Mar 18, 2013",4,"Finally George Lucas returned to make a decent Star War's movie. After the great original trilogy of Star Wars, George Lucas promised to make the sequuel trilogy of it, but he gave up due to family problems. Years passed and Gerge Lucas promised to make a new Star Wars trilogy, only it was counting before the events of the original trilogy, telling the story of the best villain of all time ... Darth Vader. The fans were exited to this new trilogy, and finally in 2001, ""Phantoon menance"" came and it was awfull, soo much boring. And then the sequel ""Attack of the Clones"" came in 2002 and and was a little better, but continued boring.
And 2004 came, and with him Episode 3 - ""The Revenge of the Sith,"" I, who was disappointed with the previous episodes, I was waiting for something boring again, actually I had an pleasant surprise waiting for me.
The Revenge of the Sith hit me, and hit me good, this was the movie that George should have done from the beginning. He was very loyal to the original trilogy, to the fate of the characters and the events that led to the original trilogy, but also as Darth Vader himself. George gives a focus on character and what led her to become the greatest villain of cinema. He was good before, it was Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi with a good heart and intentions of justice, but he was denied that, he saw their beliefs being destroyed, I personally would have done the same as him, but not so exaggerated, because As said before, this situation led him to madness, turning into pure evil. Not only with him but with all characters get better, Obi Wan learns to be more mature when needed, Yoda is more Badass than ever, The Emperor was the best surprise for me, I hate him more than before.
The film begins with that boringness of the previous ones, but it improves over increasingly. Staying with the ambiance of the original trilogy, with absolute tension and we are very concerned about the fate of the characters. And how George can put history, politics, and  action sequences ith this magnificent world is fantastic to see. With stunning scenery, a delightful soundtrack to listen, with an exciting ending, Episode 3 is one of the best Star Wars movie ever."
"Mar 18, 2013",4.5,The best of the three prequels.
"Mar 18, 2013",1,"Wow, Anakin is Darth Vader. Never saw that one coming!"
"Mar 18, 2013",5,darth vador lookd pretty nyc wen he dditn have d@ gay suit on
"Mar 18, 2013",2,"The biggest problem with this movie is Darth Vader. The movie acts as if he's already famous, and he's not."
"Mar 18, 2013",2,These digital effects are really pissing me off. The story was weak. Did this movie need to be so dark? Did Anakin need to be a mass murdering psychopath?
"Mar 18, 2013",5,"It's Star Wars, HELLO!!!"
"Mar 17, 2013",4,Explains many things that were given n the first three movies...
"Mar 17, 2013",5,"It is great so much action, well put together"
"Mar 17, 2013",4.5,"Natalie Portman is completely wasted (check her out in V for Vendetta instead).  Why do guys who have no love lives insist on writing love stories?  Lucas needs to let others polish the script and direct.  This is by far the best of the new episodes.  I place it third in the saga behind ""Empire"" and ""New Hope"".  The ewoks just blow in ""Return"".  That was the beginning of the end for Lucas.  The pandering just continues."
"Mar 17, 2013",1.5,The last three are better (you need Han Solo).
"Mar 17, 2013",5,\m/  MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU
"Mar 17, 2013",4,Same as lotr...friggin awesome.
"Mar 16, 2013",4.5,Jar Jar surviving is a 1/2 star deduction.
"Mar 16, 2013",3,"IT WAS GOOD, HAVN'T SEEN IT IN A WHILE!"
"Mar 16, 2013",5,"Great movie to finish up the series, definately the best of the saga."
"Mar 16, 2013",5,Star Wars is the best love them all can't wait for the new 1
"Mar 14, 2013",1,It's a really depressing movie!
"Mar 14, 2013",3,"original trilogy was WAY better, really not a great movie"
"Mar 13, 2013",3,why not? make : force unleashed in movie
"Mar 12, 2013",5,The best of the Prequels. The film finally gets to the point of how Anakin Skywalker becomes the evil Sith lord Darth Vader. The film is the most epic of all the Star Wars film but could never surpass the original trilogy.
"Mar 12, 2013",5,thought it was a little rushed
"Mar 12, 2013",4.5,Wasn't the best Star Wars.
"Mar 12, 2013",3,good when it came out! seen it to many times toi'm bored of it!
"Mar 11, 2013",4,"The only one of the ""new trilogy"" I thought was semi-bareable."
"Mar 11, 2013",4,so needed a better name
"Mar 10, 2013",3,great special effects
"Mar 10, 2013",2,"I didnt like it it was a bit of a let down,saw it a cinemas with ma boys!"
"Mar 09, 2013",5,The best starwars movie ever.
"Mar 08, 2013",3.5,cant beat star war movies
"Mar 08, 2013",1,i dont like star wars
"Mar 07, 2013",3,"It's okay, kinda geeky in a way"
"Mar 07, 2013",4.5,"Easily the better of the three prequel films, 'Revenge' offers great character moments, terrifically choreographed fight sequences, and wondrous locales, all while acting as a fitting bridge between the old and the new."
"Mar 07, 2013",4,"The ""Clone Wars"" has been going on for three years. And things are starting to drasticly change for the worse. 

""Chancellor Palpatine"" (Ian McDiarmid) hs been kidnapped, and ""Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi"" (Ewan McGregor) and his student ""Anikan Skywalker"" (Hayden Christensen) went in under heavy attack to save him. 

But, it turned out to all be a set up. ""Palpatine"" staged his own kidnapping, as he is the evil ""Sith Lord"" that ""Master Yoda"" (voiced by Frank Oz) knew about, but was uncertain of his true identity. What ""Yoda,"" and the rest of the ""Jedi Council,"" do not know is that ""Palpatine's"" plans include seducing ""Skywalker"" into joining the ""Dark Side"" of the ""Force,"" the mysterious energy that binds everything together. 

Almost immediately, starting after the opening scrolling text, you are bombarded with an incredible space battle. Throughout the entire movie, you are presented with incredible scenery which causes me to STRONGLY recommend you watch this in wide-screen format. The scenery, which is obviously CGI in most cases, is not only well designed, but well shot. 

Another amazing piece of this film are the battle scenes, including the ""lightsaber"" duels. These scenes are incredibly well choreographed, and never allow the audience to take a long enough breath to relax. 

We get to see some familiar faces in this film from the original trilogy. However, they are under used and are not given much to do. We also get to meet some new faces in this film which help up the backstory leading into the original trilogy. 

There are some real good performances, which sometimes have to work with some pretty bad lines in the script. However, the actors make the weaker lines in the dialogue work well and you don't really catch them unless you see this movie a few times. Some other performances are a little hard to watch, but that is thanks to what the actors were given in the script. 

There are some scenes which lag pretty bad, thanks to the writing. The lines are hard to digest in these scenes, but are tolerable. 

One thing that will take your breath away is the appearance that this trilogy had been leading up to -- the appearance of ""Darth Vader."" As you see the transformation of ""Skywalker into the ""Dark Lord of the Sith,"" you hold your breath in anticipation of hearing the famed breathing sound effect that once sent chills down the spine of my younger sister who use to be terrified by one of the greatest villains in sci-fi history. And you will get a chill going down your spine when you hear ""Vader"" take his first breath. 

Despite the minor flaws with dialogue, this movie is enjoyable to watch. And it makes up for the weaker film which leads into this one."
"Mar 07, 2013",5,Tie up all those loose ends.
"Mar 06, 2013",3.5,First 3 were way better.
"Mar 06, 2013",3.5,"Waaaay better than episode II, but that didn't require much"
"Mar 05, 2013",2,Better than episode 1.
"Mar 05, 2013",4,the best starwars ever
"Mar 04, 2013",3.5,"Good movie, but the ""NOOO"" at the end just ruined the entire franchise."
"Mar 03, 2013",2,"It was kinda good, but not a big star wars fan"
"Mar 03, 2013",1.5,One of the worse ones... especially some of the acting
"Mar 03, 2013",4,GD BUT NOT AS GD AS THE ORIGINALS
"Mar 03, 2013",3.5,"George Lucas finally redeems himself after two somewhat lackluster prequels, we finally see the two trilogies unite and the ending is quite satisfying on all levels."
"Mar 03, 2013",3.5,If you can get past the acting its a good film. The action is great and the saber duel at the end is the best light saber scene in all of the films. I feel that the story is very good as well. But as I said Lucas has a tough time handling the acting in these film and it shows. Some scenes are very awkward and arnt natural at all. I don't think the casting is good either especially Samuel L. Jackson who looks very out of place. Once again though if you can get past the bullcrap then this is a solid flick
"Mar 02, 2013",4,Decent ending to the 1st 3 chapters
"Mar 02, 2013",5,"Such a tragedy, but we Star Wars geeks knew this moment was coming. Bye bye Anakin."
"Mar 02, 2013",5,"My review for the whole series: Filled with Buddhist and Daoist philosophy, the Jedi believe Fear is the cause of all suffering. The example given is Anakin's fear for loosing Padme, which results from that fear and causes immense anger, hate, and pain. Extremely realistic character development, Vader's story serves as a guideline for how not to deal with fear or grief. As described in episode 2, compassion is unconditional love while attachment only leads to loss. Episode 1, although I'll admit was hindered by bad script and acting, was saved by Yoda's quote, ""Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering."" The events of episodes 2 &amp; 3 explain and back up the quote. Contrary to what most say, the original trilogy was fun to watch but lacked the amazing character development and philosophy. If the story from the prequel trilogy was told with the storytelling methods from the original trilogy, it would've been perfect."
"Mar 02, 2013",5,"Call me a deranged fangirl, but I simply loved it. Anakin's transgression couldn't have been depicted more perfectly."
"Mar 01, 2013",5,Anything Star Wars is good.
"Mar 01, 2013",1.5,"A few decent moments but on the whole, utter nonsense. Too many cheesy one liners and over the top animation."
"Feb 28, 2013",4.5,awsome spec. effects
"Feb 28, 2013",5,A great Star Wars film and possibly the best film of all time.
"Feb 27, 2013",4,"By far the best one. Fast paced and beautiful the whole way through. I feel so honored that I got to see it as one of the first across the country. There was so much action crossed with love. The action and settings of the movie really traces the slow decent into Darth Vador. If you haven't seen the first 2 or the last 3, you really should before you see this movie. It will all mean so much to you and make so much more sense. Don't worry if you feel lost at the beginning even as a fan, I was, but that's the intention. They really tied all together and ended with a beautiful shot that leads you right back to the originals."
"Feb 27, 2013",3.5,the best of the prequels...but thats not saying much
"Feb 26, 2013",3,they only good part was luke im your father
"Feb 26, 2013",5,I'd follow anikin to the dark side any day of the week team sith
"Feb 26, 2013",0.5,whats with Star Wars
"Feb 26, 2013",5,"Utapau is rocky and barren, like Tatooine and Geonosis, but the sinkholes make it distinguishable from the other planets that are of arid climate. Mustafar is one of the most unique planets in the saga, being a volcanic hotbed of fire, not only setting the stage of the final battle, but representing the psychological state of one of the main characters.
The opening sequence is amazing; I felt like I was being whisked through a massive space battle-this was an amazing feeling. The additional CGI action sequences also look very good. Complimenting these battles are 5 lightsaber duels-the most in an individual Star Wars episode. Each features its own intriguing and interesting aspects, but, of course, the most iconic is the duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader on Mustafar. The duel's combatants both move at a lightning-fast pace-in fact, the duelists are the fastest in lightsaber use than any other duel in the saga-not only that, but the duel takes place in the most hazardous environment, which increases the tension. The emotional impact of the duel cannot be overstated; best friends/brother figures fighting each other is undeniably a tragedy.
Speaking of which, Anakin is the tragic/fallen hero in the film, while Palpatine is a devious mastermind who acts as a twisted father figure to Anakin. Obi-Wan, meanwhile, completes his transition from a High Jedi General-a commander in the Grand Army of the Republic, and a Jedi Master-to a hermit on Tatooine. Finally, the children of Anakin and Padmé are born, symbolizing the birth of hope, a hope that stands in the face of the overwhelming despair that engulfed everything in the film.
George Lucas' writing is still excellent; the scene where Palpatine declares himself Galactic Emperor is one of the most chilling moments ever in a non-horror movie. The interactions between characters are well-done, as is the dialogue.
Episode III is the most tragic film of the saga-that is undeniable. The feeling of impending doom during the first half of the film is nearly palpable. When the second half begins, so does all the tragedy. I really felt for the 3 main characters as their worlds came undone around them, especially Anakin-during the entire prequel trilogy, he endures so much hardship and loss; he, in my opinion, is one of the most tragic protagonists in film history.
Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is an immensely satisfying conclusion to the prequel trilogy-the first half of the Star Wars saga-and perfectly sets up the original trilogy. What more could a Star Wars fan ask for?"
"Feb 26, 2013",4.5,Favorite? I think yes.
"Feb 26, 2013",1,"This film exhibits poor writing, acting, storytelling, just name any feature and it will most likely be a disappointment. Anakin's fall to the dark side is a ready made story with a huge amount of potential and it has been thoroughly wasted. In that way, it is the worst of the three films and is not considered so only because it is as close as we get to the original trilogy."
"Feb 25, 2013",2,Maybe I expected too much
"Feb 25, 2013",5,I am a huge star wars fan. So no doubt about that movie.
"Feb 25, 2013",2,omg so fuckin loooong!
"Feb 24, 2013",3.5,"Probably one of the best done of the entire 6-part series, Revenge ties the two trilogies together. I sadly cannot rate it higher because of how frustrating it is to see the main character turn evil. How often does this happen? It is a truly unique saga, and this film is the lynchpin for it."
"Feb 24, 2013",3.5,Better than the 'first' two but still not great. Very campy near the end.
"Feb 24, 2013",4,the sagas new installment that was better then ep 1
"Feb 23, 2013",5,"Amazing story, plot must see, i can't want for the live action show"
"Feb 23, 2013",1.5,I haven't watched it but I heard it was good
"Feb 23, 2013",4.5,Have not seen it in 3D but overall I really like it
"Feb 23, 2013",4,The only one of the first three worth recognition for amazing visual effects and great storyline.
"Feb 22, 2013",3.5,why did they make this one last?
"Feb 22, 2013",5,The best movie from the prequels i wish that 1 and 2 had the quality of this one
"Feb 22, 2013",3,"if your a star wars fan you'll love it, if not then you'll hate it, simple as that."
"Feb 21, 2013",4.5,i did really like this movie
"Feb 21, 2013",2,"George Lukas can't write. Nor does: ""Ok so turn slightly this way on this line, and maybe look sadder when you say this sylabil of this word,"" count as directing. He manages to make an entire cast act badly, it must be a talent. Oh except maybe Yoda. But even he was questionable when he went CGI. Oh ok and MAYBE R2's beeps. But that's all he gets. BEEPS. (Although better than the other two prequils.)"
"Feb 21, 2013",2,Good action but again some cheesy jokes compared to the old films
"Feb 21, 2013",5,SRARWARS RULES :D not seen it yet want 2 tho lol!
"Feb 21, 2013",4,"An exciting and emotional entry into the star wars series. Altough i would agree(with those who arent fans of the prequels), it could of been better,in terms of dialogue.This ambitious and spectacular film, brings a satisfying conclusion to one of the greatest sci fi franchises ever(original trilogy), and helps us understand what George lucas sought out to accomplish, when he began producing the prequels. Phantom menance,and Attack of the clones were a dissapointment, but Revenge of the sith makes us at least remember that golden age of star wars that seems to be far far away, more than it should be."
"Feb 20, 2013",4.5,"94%
The best Star Wars film in my opinion among all the 6 and it's no-nonsense dark themes are the reason."
"Feb 20, 2013",5,"My favorite movie.  For the longest time, I always wondered how Anikan became Darth Vader.  They couldnt have done it better!  And we all wondered what happened to the Jedi. It was sad, but they did a great job of showing that too!  There is nothing wrong with this movie!  Best clone wars Starwars movie!"
"Feb 20, 2013",4,gone down hill since the episodes 4 5 6
"Feb 20, 2013",5,"Love love lovel ove love. There aren't words for me to describe how much I love this film, I've wasted a lot of money because of it though."
"Feb 19, 2013",2.5,Can I just say that Hayden Christensen CANNOT ACT!!!
"Feb 19, 2013",5,5 STAR...I LOVE STAR WARS
"Feb 18, 2013",4,By far the best of the new films.
"Feb 18, 2013",4,"George Lucas's prequels to the Star Wars franchise have been duds. This on the other hand is an exquisite film with better characters than the previous installments. Lucas has a lot of climatic battle scenes and features a towering score by John Williams with heart-wrenching moments that finally completes his large, sprawling series of films. This tops the first two prequels and does what prequels should do; it sets up the first film. Though not even close to the masterpieces that are the first three Star Wars films but it still partially redeems the mixed bag that is the prequel trilogy and certainly brings in plenty of cash for Lucas."
"Feb 17, 2013",4.5,"It may not top the original trilogy, but I believe it is just on par with the original films."
"Feb 17, 2013",2.5,"A story that started so well, back when Mr Lucas was actually SANE. When Lucas took control of directing the last 3 films, only disater could be spelt. Action packed and at times fuin, episode 3 really summed up the last three films. POOR acting, POOR story and Lucas just going crazy.This film in all honesty was an insult into the older/much better films from then 70's/80's."
"Feb 17, 2013",4,"Was it the best of the prequel trilogy? Yes. Was it the best of the entire franchise? Not by a long shot, but this movie redeems itself after two dreadful movies that almost ruined my childhood. Anyways, Lucas did a phenominal job showcasing the fall of Anakin Skywalker to the dark side. It was an epic finale and it succeded my expectations. I hated Hayden Christensen as Anakin in Episode II, he's still bad in this one but compared to Episode II a lot better. As a fan, this makes the prequels worth watching with more action to keep you on the edge of your seat. The screenplay could have been better, but I can forgive Lucas (I guess). Overall, defenitely worth seeing if you're a die hard fan of the franchise!"
"Feb 17, 2013",3.5,"The last installation of the the prequals to the original Star wars saga, and the best of the three. not better acting however the plot is compelling and closing the story line to the rise of Vadar pretty well."
"Feb 16, 2013",5,The Force is strong in my family
"Feb 15, 2013",3.5,"Best of the new trilogy by far. Then again, that's still not saying much."
"Feb 15, 2013",4.5,"While it's clear the poor direction from director George Lucas often results in poor acting, story telling, and a general uneveness to the film. Revenge of the Sith boasts some of the franchises most memorable moments. With the prequal trilogy brought to  climatic an end on a shaky but very potent high note, with the lows far outwieghted by the series entries most spectacular highs in the franchise."
"Feb 14, 2013",5,only one word star wars
"Feb 14, 2013",4,amazing! i love the CG
"Feb 14, 2013",2,really just confusing
"Feb 14, 2013",5,The BEST of the new trilogy. I wish this trilogy would've started on this one.
"Feb 14, 2013",5,"Filled in some gaps for me AND was cool to watch, too!"
"Feb 13, 2013",2.5,kinda borin but ewan hot
"Feb 13, 2013",4,probably one of the best star wars movies other than return of the jedi.
"Feb 13, 2013",5,"The star wars saga is my favorite collection of movies ever. After what was a stop start to the new trilogy with episodes 1+2 (they were not that bad) lucas its the money again here. Its very dark, and shows the long awaited transition from anakin to vader and ties up all the loose ends nicely. Please george, make 7""8+9"
"Feb 12, 2013",3,Revenge of the Sith closes out the prequel trilogy as its best film.  The special effects and action sequences will give you a nerd seizure.
"Feb 12, 2013",3.5,"Not a Star Wars junkie, but still intrigued me."
"Feb 12, 2013",3,not the best star wars but the out of the new ones
"Feb 11, 2013",5,Even agreed to see it on my honeymoon while at MGM studios.
"Feb 10, 2013",5,only seen half of it
"Feb 10, 2013",5,"It's amazing what can be achieved when people actually look interested in their roles, and the script has some gravitas. Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid are quite frankly, awesome."
"Feb 10, 2013",3,"It was star wars, so good affects. Acting was a bit weak"
"Feb 09, 2013",3,Saw it and don't think that I will watch it again unless I want to fall asleep
"Feb 09, 2013",4.5,ISAW THIS MOVIE AND I NEVER MISS ANY EPISODE EVER SINCE...
"Feb 08, 2013",3.5,"Episode 4, 5 and 6 were much better stories"
"Feb 08, 2013",2,Too out of this world for me but it was ok.
"Feb 08, 2013",4,Anakin is only good when he's bad.  Finally the whining stopped and it was more of an adventure.
"Feb 07, 2013",3.5,"amazing effects and an epic transition to the original saga, it was decent apart from the dialogue which felt unnatural at times, sometimes forced or silly."
"Feb 07, 2013",4.5,"Though not as good as the Original Trilogy, Revenge of the Sith is a great film in the Star Wars Saga. It brings back much of what makes the Original Trilogy so great. The action is good, effects are great, the dialogue though not perfect is better than that in the previous two films, and the final duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan is the best Lightsaber Duel in the entire Star Wars Saga. It does have its problems though, but it overall is a great movie experience."
"Feb 07, 2013",5,"Oh yeah now it is time for the final conclusion of the prequel trilogy. What happened when Anakin turned to the dark side? Why did he join the Sith? Did Padme give birth to their children? What retaliation give Obi-Wan give in return? Who was it that first found this all out? All will be revealed in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Now war is uprising between the Jedis and the Siths, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is now married to Queen Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) and they are expecting their first baby. But since Anakin has fear of losing her just like he lost his mother previously, he turns to Emperor Palpatine (Ian MacDiarmid) for help and starts following in his footsteps. Later on, he kills of Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) for having his arm being chopped off, stops Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) from killing the Emperor, betrays the Jedi, kills younglings and leads an army of Siths. Yoda collapses and senses the terror that Anakin is going through. He tells Obi-Wan the truth who then tells Padme. When she finds out, Anakin believes that she's on his side and strangles her and then Obi-Wan fights him and then leaves him to burn in the lava after chopping both his legs off. Anakin then recovers from the burns with a big black suit and is named Darth Vader; needing to see Padme, the Emperor, now named Darth Sidious lies to him that he killed her with his anger when she really dies from childbirth. Giving birth to Luke and Leia, Obi-Wan separates the two babies and hands them to different parents and the prequel trilogy ends there! When everyone saw this in the cinema, they did not want to leave the cinema because it had such a fucking epic conclusion to the prequels. I don't know if it's the best out of the prequels but this movie says a lot. Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith gets a 10/10."
"Feb 07, 2013",5,Did I like this movie? LOOK WHO YOU'RE ASKING!!!
"Feb 07, 2013",5,EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC
"Feb 06, 2013",2.5,The Frankenstein moment was painful.
"Feb 06, 2013",3,cool special effects.
"Feb 06, 2013",2.5,Never got the whole Star Wars craze.
"Feb 06, 2013",1,very good one of my favorites
"Feb 06, 2013",1,YEA!!! Lets go see a movie we all regret seeing because it drug on and on and little kids went to see it just for the lightsaber battles!!! Keep shovelling out money and stuffing your face with popcorn.
"Feb 05, 2013",1.5,"The last and darkest prequel of the Star Wars trilogy. So in revenge of the sith, anakin and obi wan have to rescue palpatine from count dooku and general grievous. Then yoda has to go to the wookie planet to defeat the droids the droids. Anakin turns to the dark side and the jedi are killed and the separatists killed, and darth Vader is here so let's get to my opinions. So first the very beginning, anakin wants to go help a clone because he's being attacked. Since when did u jedi ever care about the clones. Next is the ray shields, this part doesn't bother me to much, but still. Wouldn't it be smarter to keep them in the ray shields instead of taking them out. There's so many fucken buttons on that ship and there can't be one to explode or destroy what's inside the ray shields. Next which is one I wonder about. Do count dooku or grievous know who darth sideous is? I also want to know if palpatine is controlling them or something or does he just want them to die? If anyone rads this review, please answer the questions above if u know the answer. Next is the part where padme and anakin are talking at night and one line I remember anakin saying was ""I'm so in love with you"". I was listening to a review on this and added laughter to the background of this scene and I agree this dialogue is stupid and hilarious. Next is the jedi caring about the wookie planet. Y can't u guys afford to lose this planet. Is there oil for your ships there, or did u guys buy this planet from another planet? Next is windu and the 3 other jedi to kill palpatine. 2 of the jedi go down in seconds and they call themselves jedi, he'll no. At least kit fisto puts up a fight. Then anakin comes in and cuts off windus hand and he dies moments later. I'm actually happy that the kids die in this movie later on, and don't think I hate kids. Then all of the jedi die and one of the jedi it was kind of sad because he didn't know wht they were doing well I guess none of the jedi did, but still. I'm talking about the tall headed jedi. Then yoda has a fight with darth sideous and anakin duels obi wan. The fight is 2 long. Then anakin dies kind of and he becomes Vader and lastly padme dies, but Luke and Leia r born. Now I don't have much more to say for this movie other than it was the best of the prequels, but still not the best Star Wars movie. Well my review is done and tomorrow is Star Wars episode 4 A New Hope. Ttyl"
"Feb 05, 2013",5,My opinion the best Star Wars movie ever!
"Feb 05, 2013",0.5,"If this is the one w/ Jar-Jar Binks, I take back the 1/2 star."
"Feb 05, 2013",4,"DARK FORCES RISING, THERE WAS"
"Feb 04, 2013",4,A very heart-wrenching and emotionally great finale.
"Feb 04, 2013",5,yay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 04, 2013",2,Lucas lost it some where between the trilogies.
"Feb 03, 2013",5,Star Wars is freakin awesome!
"Feb 03, 2013",3,"George Lucas took advantage of the mastery display of CGI sword play which was the only good thing about Attack of the Clones, as we get to see Master Yoda will the lightsaber again this time take on the Sith Lord and let's not forget the wonderful introduction of Darth Vader, Revenge of the Sith is the best of the new Star Wars trilogy. The thing I did enjoy most in the movie is the pace it moved, it was all happening fast from the dissolving of the Republic, the corruption of Anakin and then Lucas made we the viewers eager to see the faceoff between the Mentor and apprentice, as we wait to see Obi-Wan Kenobi take on young, proud and powerful Anakin Skywalker.

Lucas did the writing by himself, unlike the previous Attack of the Clones where he hired some others to help make a better star wars movie than The Phantom Menace, which brought about more theory than action, this movie is more about the force, and the corruption of power. The movie's lightsaber fight scenes were intense, Obi-Wan's battle with General Grievous (Grievous is a fearsome looking cyborg who seemed to be having some health issues. He is the General of the Separatists' droid army) was just fun to watch as Obi-Wan had to take on the four armed lightsaber (with each arm armed with a lightsaber) fighting cyborg. There were also many impressive lightsaber fight scenes. The ending battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin was very impressive when you look at the speed they moved and the complexity of their strikes and paring. It was even more impressive when I found out that neither Ewan McGregor nor Hayden Christensen used a stunt double in any of the lightsaber battles.

The events that occurred in this movie happened three years after the Clone Wars, with the Jedi Knights on a massive mission which had them all spread across the galaxy with the clone army as the waged war against the Separatists. Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was sent to deal with General Grievous, leader of the Separatist Army while Anakin Skywalker had some time alone to grow closer to Palpatine, the Chancellor of the Galactic Republic (The Sith Lord). 

During their discussions Anakin is told about the dark side and its advantages by the Sith Lord, Palpatine. Anakin at first tried to disapprove but soon succumbs to the temptations of the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader.

Here is a Star Wars prequel that can stand beside the original trilogy that Lucas did in the 70s and 80s.

"Feb 03, 2013",4.5,This was a good movie but it was sooo sad
"Feb 03, 2013",0.5,"By the time this movie came out I had such lowered expectations that it managed to marginally surpass my expectations and be merely ""Okay"".  I still nearly lose my breath laughing at the romance which is both the worst and creepiest ever depicted.  This film is notable for being the one that made lightsaber battles boring and/or silly.  

My theory is that George Lucas hates Star Wars and, with the prequel trilogy, set out to ruin it on purpose."
"Feb 02, 2013",2.5,Eh.. It's Star Wars.. A must see even if you're not in to Sci Fi
"Feb 02, 2013",4,The best of the prequel trilogy.
"Feb 02, 2013",5,"Great actions,movie,also touching, moments,lovable"
"Feb 01, 2013",4,"Where the other Prequels failed, Episode 3 succeeds, as they make Anakin Skywalker a snarky, 3-dimensional character rather than the whiny do-nothing plot device he was in the first movie. Ewan Mcgregor is good as always, and the political intrigue in this movie is good. The movie is written well, and is full of symbolism and good dialogue, again, unlike the others. The movie is also complemented by a fantastic score that just livens up the movie. The character transformation of Anakin to Darth Vader is one of the best cinematic transformations in history, and it is exemplified here. if you are new to the Star wars franchise, watch this one, and then 4, 5, and 6, as this is the only prequel movie deserving the title of 'Star Wars'"
"Feb 01, 2013",3,"Much of the dialogue comes off as amateurish and Lucas's directing is difficult to endure, as he focuses heavily on irritating close ups and gross green screen effects. However, Ewan mcgregor gives a strong, even heartbreaking performance behind an interesting tale of how a hero (though Hayden Christiansen is hardly a hero) can fall to evil."
"Feb 01, 2013",3,great for boys not so much for girls
"Feb 01, 2013",1.5,what a disappointment.
"Jan 31, 2013",5,This movie was awesome except Anakin cried too much.
"Jan 31, 2013",2,More General Grievous!
"Jan 31, 2013",5,havnt seen not much of a person to see movies in the theaters unless it really gets my interest.
"Jan 30, 2013",0.5,"Terrible film. Doesn't answer any of the questions created by its two predicessors, just creates new ones."
"Jan 30, 2013",4,AWESOME especially when you see his hand all burnt up.
"Jan 30, 2013",5,"Not as great as the original Star Wars films, but still a fantastic film.  Had shivers when Anakin turns into Darth Vader...sad, I know!! LOL  Think Anakin was badly cast though."
"Jan 30, 2013",3.5,Finally they let Ewan be Ewan instead of Sir Alec Guiness impersontator.  Best of the prequels but still really bad chemistry from Natalie and Hayden (both excellent actors too - Lucas what did you do??)
"Jan 30, 2013",3.5,"Definately better than episodes 1 and 2, this still can't stand up to the originals."
"Jan 30, 2013",5,any Star Wars or Star Trek or A+ with me
"Jan 29, 2013",3,"Lucas needs to start a new project,this is getting old."
"Jan 29, 2013",5,Bring Balance To The Force; Not Leave It In Darkness
"Jan 29, 2013",4.5,Very dramatic and satasfying ending to this legendary story.
"Jan 28, 2013",2.5,"The best of the prequel saga, not because of the plot, character or effects...but because the pace finally picks up and it gives us enough action to sometimes forget how stupid it is."
"Jan 27, 2013",3.5,"The best of the prequels (there's a bit more to care about in regards to story and plot and Natalie Portman is extremely hot), but that really isn't saying much about this pompous CGI crap-fest."
"Jan 27, 2013",3.5,Average but HEY! It's Star Wars.
"Jan 27, 2013",2.5,Not as great as the original 3.
"Jan 26, 2013",4.5,WOW MAN THE LIGHTSAVER FIGHTS ARE SOOOO COOL
"Jan 26, 2013",4,"-IGNORE THIS ""OUT OF FIVE"" RATING
3/4
The last and best of the prequel trilogy. Lord Sidious steps out of the shadows to tempt Anakin to the Dark Side, putting Obi-Wan and Padme in danger. Uneven, and long, but it's also a dark and emotionally powerful experience that's brimming with feelings, which the first two films came up short. Leads right into STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE."
"Jan 26, 2013",3.5,"You know, I like the prequels..So sue me. They are not nearly as bad as they have been made out to be. The Star Wars are trapped in the conventions of their story and we just want to see Anakin Skywalker turn into Darth Vader. I'd put this side by side with the original episode because it works so much better being compared to it. The effects and a lot of the battle scenes are awesome. The darkest of the series, here we have an amazing opening space battle, the best lightsaber duels, and the Jedi Purge. The Emperor was always a character that I liked and it was great to see how he wound up looking the way that he did. General Grievous was cool too. Obviously with years of wondering how a Jedi falls to the dark side, anyone is going to be disappointed with various results..Hell, I would have done the prequels way different too. My big gripe is the death of Padme. It's great storytelling if Darth Vader did in fact choke her to death but we never get the facts on whether she died as a result of that, childbirth, or a broken heart. The climax of this movie is great and it feels like any good story should make a viewer feel when we have that final iris closing to the final credits."
"Jan 25, 2013",4,this is by far the best of the prequels its fun and engaging but has a surprisingly powerful last half
"Jan 25, 2013",4,"Good, but not the best by far."
"Jan 25, 2013",3.5,just not as good as the originals
"Jan 25, 2013",2.5,Only really care for the originals
"Jan 25, 2013",3,"Being such a big Vader fan, the last scene with Obi and Anakin just ruined it for me."
"Jan 24, 2013",4,"Sits neatly with ""The Empire Strikes back"" as the best of the entire series. Technically brilliant, the characters and story line finally fill the gaps in the timeline that links  Eps 1-3 and 4-6. And surprisingly, for one who knew the original episodes when they were new (and I was a lot younger), just a little emotional as well. A nice way to close of the Lucas legacy."
"Jan 24, 2013",1.5,Midnight Screening couldn't save this calamity -
"Jan 24, 2013",4,Quite the saving grace for the 'new trilogy'
"Jan 24, 2013",3.5,It might be awful...but my love of Star Wars takes over on my rating.
"Jan 23, 2013",5,very very good as always
"Jan 23, 2013",4.5,good movie for the end of the new triology
"Jan 23, 2013",4,Not as good as the original but pretty good
"Jan 23, 2013",1.5,dont even remember it
"Jan 22, 2013",4,"Best of the prequels (although it only really had to compete with Episode 2), this movie nearly fixed all the problems the new trilogy had experienced. Then it gave Natalie Portman no role and put too much (yeah, too much) Chewbacca in the film. It also made no use of the good General Grievous. So sad."
"Jan 22, 2013",4.5,I love the end as cool as i love part that..
"Jan 22, 2013",4.5,Lot of eye candy (SFX) and good closure to the Star Wars story.  I'm a huge fan.
"Jan 22, 2013",5,Best of the new trilogy. Surprisingly emotional for anyone who really loves Star Wars. Not for posers.
"Jan 21, 2013",3,the key to the first 2 catching up with the last 3
"Jan 21, 2013",4.5,"Science Fiction, Whoo Hoo!"
"Jan 21, 2013",4,"As a fan of Darth Vader,  think this picture has done him justice by paying him a heartbreaking and brutal portrayal of his rise"
"Jan 21, 2013",5,"Star Wars, noting more to say..."
"Jan 20, 2013",2,Great Special effects. Good cast. Horrible story. Bad acting.
"Jan 20, 2013",3,How does Queen Amadala go from kick butt and take no prisoners to a simpering miss?  Love Obi-Wan and Yoda is my favorite Jedi!
"Jan 20, 2013",2,to long to boring and goes where no scripe should ever go
"Jan 20, 2013",4,I am a big star wars fan. The story and graphics are great.
"Jan 20, 2013",4,"Y por fin concluye la reciente trilogía. Sí, algunos tópicos y villanos no taaaan bien aprovechados son errores que flotan por ahí, pero que no afectan al notable resultado final. Mientras que el episodio I era medianamente correcto y el II parecía más un pretexto para lo que sería la siguiente parte (aun ofreciendo mejor acción), esta llega a unos niveles de épica de los que pocas películas pueden presumir. Para empezar, la historia es mucho más centrada que su antecesora, y consta de subtramas que llegan a ser definitivas en la historia, lo cual se agradece. La duración me llega a ser un poco excesiva, pero su desarrollo es muy correcto. El estúpido lado emocional del episodio II evoluciona a una complejidad emocional más madura, mostrando un notable perfil psicológico de Anakin, en la que Hayden Christensen da todo de sí. No sólo eso; la película está cargada de escenas emotivas, ya sea en el desarrollo de los personajes o en la acción. Los personajes sienten y sufren, como humanos (?) que son. Y qué decir de los efectos visuales: pese a ser CGI en su mayoría, son sencillamente extraordinarios y nos ofrecen escenas de acción de escala infinitamente mayor que sus antecesoras (lo único que ha ido mejorando por película; lógicamente, supongo). Sin duda, un espectáculo apoteósico y muy bien construido, la única de la trilogía de precuelas que realmente merece la pena."
"Jan 20, 2013",4.5,The epic climax to the star wars saga and the rise of Darth Vader. Hayden Christian plays Anakin Skywalker with perfection showing a true transformation from hero to villain in the epic duel with Obi Wan on  Mustafar. Episode three has the best lightsaber duels of the saga and does its best to tie in to episode 4 A new hope which in my honest opinion does rather well.
"Jan 20, 2013",4.5,"My fav out of the first 3 episodes. There's stuff I'd like to change, but other than that, great!"
"Jan 20, 2013",4,Best of all the Star Wars episodes. We could've done without 1&amp;2!
"Jan 20, 2013",3.5,Best of the series! To date
"Jan 19, 2013",5,I guess Disney is doing this to raise money for new trilogy in 2015
"Jan 19, 2013",4.5,Best of the new ones by far!
"Jan 19, 2013",5,The power of teh Dark Side!
"Jan 19, 2013",3.5,Not a bad ending to the less than impressive story arc of the prequels.
"Jan 19, 2013",4,"i like all the star wars, but although this one isnt my fave, it still rocks!"
"Jan 19, 2013",4,Not my least favorite
"Jan 19, 2013",5,Of course it's a great film - it's Star Wars for Gods sake!!
"Jan 18, 2013",4,"Christianson's acting still has not improved-- he sounds like a robot-- however, the fight scenes were excellent"
"Jan 18, 2013",4,Its a good movie need cutenue the saga
"Jan 16, 2013",3.5,"Revenge of the Sith is by far the best film of the prequel trilogy, or the strongest one at least. Hayden Christensen is pretty much wooden in his lines, though Ian McDiarmid provides a truly sinister and compelling performances as Palpatine. The connections to the original trilogy in this Star Wars film are far more obvious than they were in the last two films. The special effects are truly impressive, even on par with films being released today. The magic that made the original Star Wars so memorable is slightly present in Revenge of the Sith, but not quite perfected. The upcoming sequel trilogy will hopefully bring back some of that movie magic that has sorely been missed since Return of the Jedi."
"Jan 16, 2013",4,"my fav one
well the only one i remember"

"Jan 16, 2013",4,This sixth and final installment of George Lucas' epic space opera will please die-hard fanatics and non-believers alike -- largely due to awesome digital effects and the sheer power of the mythology.
"Jan 16, 2013",1.5,Not sure on that one.
"Jan 16, 2013",5,One of the best series of films ever made.

"Jan 15, 2013",2,star wars? c'mon?!?!?
"Jan 15, 2013",1.5,Certainly not the best SW. Hayden seems out of his depth...not convincing as the soon to be Lord of the Sith. Rest of the cast appeared to be just reading the script.
"Jan 15, 2013",1,havent really see it
"Jan 14, 2013",2.5,"Not exactly my favorite,but it's part of the story"

"Jan 13, 2013",5,the holy trilogy epiloge
"Jan 13, 2013",1.5,Had to see it..was ok.
"Jan 13, 2013",4,"Revenge of the Sith finally gets it right with a dark feel, very well crafted visuals and action sequences, and much better plot tying into the original trilogy."
"Jan 13, 2013",4,The best of the 'new' trilogy
"Jan 13, 2013",5,Do Not care what you say they are all great movies.

"Jan 12, 2013",4,I can feel your anger. It gives you focus. It makes you stronger.
"Jan 12, 2013",3.5,the best star wars movie
"Jan 11, 2013",3.5,The big focus of this film was the big reveal of how Anakin became Vader. The real thing that impressed me is the rise to power of Emperor Palpatine.  Seeing his acceptance speech was the true moment if this film for me. McDiarmid made the movie for me.  I left very satisfied.
"Jan 11, 2013",4,episode 4 was the best though!
"Jan 11, 2013",5,awesome is realy good
"Jan 11, 2013",3.5,"My favorite of the prequels...! It's got my favorite villain, General Grievous...! I CAN'T WAIT to see his fight with Obi-Wan again...!"

"Jan 11, 2013",3.5,nice to tie up loose ends
"Jan 10, 2013",2,oh my goodness.. it was terrible. all effects and no story and if i was nine months pregnent i would not were mini skirts
"Jan 10, 2013",2,the only parts that were worth a damn was where darth vader is introduced and the other is the fight scene.
"Jan 10, 2013",5,this film is out of this world it the best one out af all star wars films
"Jan 09, 2013",3,I'm just not really a big Star Wars fan. The movie was made pretty well though.
"Jan 09, 2013",4.5,"This movie had a lot that it had to do...wrap up the first three episodes, develop a coherent plot line of its own, and tie the first three and second three episodes together.  Overall, it did a good job of doing all of that.  There were some slow points, but I think it sucessfully bridged the huge gap that it needed to."
"Jan 09, 2013",4.5,Star Wars...what else must be said...
"Jan 09, 2013",3.5,best of the new ones
"Jan 09, 2013",5,This was a great movie.

"Jan 08, 2013",3.5,Bad acting but its Star Wars ya no
"Jan 08, 2013",1.5,"Just as bad as the other prequels, because it's boring and you don't care about anything that happens."
"Jan 08, 2013",5,Excellent Movie. Makes all of the Star Wars Saga come together.
"Jan 08, 2013",2,i don't really like scifi
"Jan 08, 2013",5,Aww..series is all over
"Jan 08, 2013",5,THIS ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jan 07, 2013",5,Best MOVIE EVER!!!!!!
"Jan 07, 2013",3,"Definitely better than Episodes 1 and 2, but only because of Darth Vader. The originally trilogy is still better."
"Jan 07, 2013",5,i think it is the best of the lot
"Jan 07, 2013",2.5,"Should have been great, it wasnt"
"Jan 07, 2013",2.5,i didn't watch it eh

"Jan 07, 2013",2.5,NEVER REALLY GOT INTO STAR WARS. MAYBE 1 DAY I WILL
"Jan 06, 2013",5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE TOO!
"Jan 06, 2013",4.5,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't like this a lot, but I do, good fight scenes, Vader becoming Vader, birth of the twins...just great"
"Jan 06, 2013",4,The tragic life of Anikan-Vader.
"Jan 06, 2013",3,the script could have been better but i still liked the movie.
"Jan 06, 2013",5,Worth watching just for the ending
"Jan 06, 2013",5,I love this One it wraped up how Darth Vader Became Vader and it was a good story.
"Jan 06, 2013",3.5,"George Lucas didn't lost his touch, in fact, he closed this trilogy with a movie with 2 hours of impresive visual effects and a really good history."
"Jan 06, 2013",2.5,"It rounds off the saga very well with an impressive fight scene but there just isn't enough to save it from falling flat on its face. The dialogue is so hammy, it doesn't sound natural coming from anyone in any galaxy. This movie WAS genuinely stupid but what it WASN'T was a waste of time."
"Jan 06, 2013",5,Best prequel of the saga and it definitely shows.
"Jan 05, 2013",4,these movies may not have been better than the originals but I do believe that this one sums up what episodes iv-vi are about
"Jan 05, 2013",1.5,"after all the hype from my friends this movie really blew it hard, at least in my oppinion"
"Jan 05, 2013",3.5,"it was a OK star wars film, the final scene was pretty epic"
"Jan 05, 2013",5,"BEST MOVIE EVER!!
For 2005. lol"
"Jan 05, 2013",2,George Lucas ruined his own movies...Episodes 1-3 stink...
"Jan 05, 2013",3.5,"when seeing it, I enjoyed the tying up, but then the die hard original trilogy fan ruined it for me"
"Jan 05, 2013",4.5,The end has come and it was worth the wait!
"Jan 05, 2013",3.5,"With Attack of the Clone's out of the way, the hype for what was said to be the last Star Wars movie ever (at the time) grew. You couldn't go anywhere without seeing any form of promotion for this movie. The trailers for this one promised more action and excitement to bring this franchise to a thrilling finale. But most importantly, it promised to finally show us the origins of Darth Vader. Something that every fan has wanted to see since day one. Expectations were mixed, but the excitement was there, and thankfully what we got was one epic way to end a series. Is it perfect? Hell no. But if this doesn't qualify as an improvement, I don't know what does.
The Good
Remember the opening scene to Phantom Menace and how boring it was with its tax negotiations, and how Episode 2 tried to fix that by opening with an assassination attempt? Well Episode 3 takes it a couple of steps further. We are put into the middle of this giant ass space battle with lasers and ships flying and blowing up in all directions and Jedi star fighters dodging them all like it was their birthright. We see them to be our main heroes Anakin, played by Hayden (I'm not getting any more work after this) Christensen, and Obi-Wan, played by Ewan McGregor. We quickly learn that Palpatine, played by Ian McDiarmid, has been taken hostage by Count Dooku, played by Christopher Lee, and a new villain General Greivous, voice acted by Matthew Wood. Our heroes make it to the ship by the skin of their teeth, jump out of the ships and destroy all the battle droids in their path. After some funny banter and fun scenes between Anakin, Obi-Wan, and R2, played by Kenny Baker, we get a brief but awesome lightsaber fight, Anakin kills Dooku, the Chancellor is saved, but our heroes later end up captured. They escape their restraints, fight all the security forces, Greivous escapes out into the vacuum of space, the entire ship breaks in half, enters the planet's atmosphere, everyone almost burns up, they land safely, and the audience is finally given a chance to breathe. How's THAT for an intro!?
In case you couldn't tell, the action in this one is excessively stepped up. Compared to the previous movies, which only kept the lightsaber fights to 2 per film, one of them being incredibly short, Revenge of the Sith has five. All of them thrilling, story based, and progressive to the plot. The final climatic battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan in the volcano is especially good. I'll even go as far to say it's the best fight in the whole saga in terms of scope, technique, editing, and the dilemma between the characters. All of the action throughout the movie is well done and feels huge and important.
The dialogue is also stepped up. Yes we still get some cheesy love banter between Anakin and Padme, but thankfully it's in short supply and isn't as bothersome this time around. The rest of the dialogue is still technically full of exposition, but this time around it's presented in a more engaging manor. There's genuine reactions and emotions thrown into the mix. You're interested in what's going on and you understand why it's happening, for the most part. This is also due to the performances.
The acting in Episode 3 is a significant improvement over the last two. When he doesn't have any lame lines to say, Hayden Christensen can act with his facial expressions really damn well. Whenever he's supposed to make a hard decision, he seems genuinely troubled. Whenever he gives off an evil stare, he looks damn intimidating! 2 of the best scenes in the movie involve him acting with his facial expressions. The first being when he learns that Padme is pregnant. Both he and Natalie's performances give the perfect balance of shock, fear, happiness, and then right back to fear again. The next scene is when they're both separated but looking out their respective windows at each other. With no dialogue what-so-ever, this scene illustrates their contemplation of whats going to happen to themselves and each other. That scene alone is so much more powerful than any line written in this entire series.
Ian McDiarmid also gets a lot more moments to shine in this one. In this film, he's finally revealed to be the villain of the entire series. The Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Excluding some of his goofier moments he steals the show in every scene he's in. The way he manipulates Anakin into trusting him to save Padme from death is done well and makes his reveal to be quite a stunner for those who don't know the actor plays the same role in Return of the Jedi. Throughout the series we got to see him in every light a good villain should be in. Calm and calculating, loud and roaring, joyful and content, angry and bitter, and most importantly, chilling and intimidating. Not to mention, there are a lot of shots of him looking creepy as hell. Yes seeing an old man do this kind of fighting is ridiculous, but say what you want about the prequel trilogy because in the end, you can't deny that Palpatine is by far the best character.
I would also like to note how much of a great choice Ewan McGregor was for Obi-Wan. In this movie especially, he commands a good amount of authority, but also illustrates the outlook of a young disciple who's still learning. In the other movies, he's not as bland as everyone else is, and he tries his best to make every scene interesting. He has a lot of energy on set that adds a lot to his performance whether he's fighting for his life or just calm and collected. Yeah some of his lines can be a bit laughable (i.e. the ""killing younglings"" line) but if anyone else had to say them, they would be a lot more painful.
The last scene I should touch up upon while I'm here is the Opera House scene. This is by far the smartest scene written in this entire movie. In this scene, Palpatine sits Anakin down and tells him a story about the dark side of the force. Obviously hinting that Palpatine had played a big part in this story and that Anakin can use his power to save Padme. But the thing is, this is one of the only things that isn't told in exposition like it would be anywhere else. It's being told as a fable that's been passed down by many generations. He doesn't tell Anakin ""Here's something I can do and you should join me if you want to learn it."" It amplifies the vitality of Anakin's conflict while also giving us something we've never seen before. This world's own mythos. It expands upon the already huge world of Star Wars by making it more mysterious and taking it to a different realm that none of the other movies have touched upon. It didn't just add something new to the story, but it evolved Star Wars into something a lot bigger than anybody had previously thought. It added a story within a story and made this world of adventure and fantasy a little more believable.
The Bad
What fans seem to complain about the most in Episode 3 is the underwhelming use of Darth Vader and how quickly Anakin turns to the dark side, which is understandable. In the beginning of the movie he seems like a great guy. He's less whiny (sort of) he's been promoted to Jedi Knight, and looks like he would strive to do the right thing. Then, the next thing you see is him about to slaughter a bunch of kids. Yeah...something's a little off there. You can argue that his troubles and conversations with Palpatine built up to it, but that's still too big of a leap in his character. Heck when he figures it out that Palpatine is a Sith Lord he does the noble thing and tries to get him arrested. He doesn't get angry with him, or lose his control. So when you see him slicing down a bunch of kids literally 15 minutes later you're just like ""Whoa! How did you get from point A to H?"" It's rushed, forced (no pun intended), and makes no sense.
When he finally becomes Darth Vader on screen and starts talking in his awesome James Earl Jones voice, keep in mind that this is the moment people have been waiting for, what does he say? ""Where's Padme? What she's dead!? NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"" Wow. After 22 years of waiting that's all we get? More complaining and whining? Damn. What a waste of potential.
The movie also suffers immensely from an uneven and disjointed pace. After the big opening action sequence and Anakin discovering that Padme's pregnant, the story just suddenly slams on the brakes and you hit your head on the dash board that is the plot. From there on, its at least 45 minutes of our characters walking around the Jedi temple talking. And yes of course, most of the performances are bland, monotone, and consist of boring political talk for the most part. There are some improvements here and there that make these scenes more interesting to sit through, but compared to the opening scene it's pretty lame that the plot comes to a screeching halt like this. Thankfully the movie picks up again when Obi-Wan fights General Grievous and we get actual story progression.
The effects in this movie are also pretty hit and miss throughout. While some locations like the Jedi Temple, the lava planet, and the space battle look damn impressive, the green screen effects, especially today, look too artificial.
Speaking of which, General Grievous is pretty much useless. Sure he looks cool but from a storytelling perspective you have no idea who he his, where he came from, and why the Jedi see him as such a threat. He's mainly a plot device to lure Obi-Wan away from the Jedi temple when all hell breaks loose. Same thing with Yoda's little mission to the Wookie home-world, where we also see Chewbacca, played by Peter Mayhew, for the first time. It just feels like a convenient plot device that these two specifically have to be sent away from the Jedi Temple at this moment in time just so they can survive the attack and be in the later movies.
Another question I've always had with this movie, even as a kid, is ""how the hell did Padme get pregnant if all Anakin's been doing lately is fighting in the clone wars?"" Even when they see each other for the first time in this movie they look like they haven't seen each other in a month! The first thing that Anakin should've thought when Padme gave him the news should've been ""Wait, then who's the father?"" Surprise!
Verdict
So all in all, Revenge of the Sith is a vast improvement over the previous two movies and brings the Star Wars saga to a fulfilling conclusion. The acting is stronger, the action is cranked up to 11, the cheesy dialogue is toned down and seems less lame, and it has a lot of surprisingly powerful and compelling scenes that expand this already huge setting. Yes there are a lot of plot elements that make no sense and the story is very uneven in terms of pacing, but for my money, Revenge of the Sith makes suffering through this prequel trilogy somewhat worth it."
"Jan 05, 2013",2.5,"Pretty strong first act, then ... *fizzle*"
"Jan 05, 2013",2,Not The best from Lucas
"Jan 05, 2013",4.5,"I'm a jedi, what would you expect?"
"Jan 05, 2013",5,Anyone out there think I would rate any Star Wars less than 5 stars? No hands? Ok.
"Jan 05, 2013",4.5,"War and fighting galore, Episode 3 thrives as the birth of Darth Vader is shown...despite some OK acting performances, the movie overall feels like what should be a modern Star Wars film."
"Jan 05, 2013",4,"It get's off to a slow and pretty mundane start but this really picks up pace towards the end.  The talking scenes feel completely relevant and there is plenty of gloss over the story.  Many characters feel more comfortable in their roles in this film than previous chapters in this saga.  Anakin really does feel torn, pained, and under the spell of the darkside.  Palpatine is one of the most conniving, manipulative, and evil villains I've ever seen on the big screen.

The senate speaking scene was an essential viewing for once.  The goofy, and silly humour whilst prevalent in the first half of the film do mute when the tone changes towards the second half.  Once the tides of crucial events changes the film becomes a roller coaster of more crucial events and riveting viewing.  The kind of things I've always want to see in the prequels.  Darth Vader born.  The Republic formed into an Empire.  The Jedi slayed.  Everything that I want to see is here and handled in the type of way I would have wanted.  The tone gets a darker and delicate string of scenes that enrich the legacy of the saga.  The score is chilling, emotional, sad, and sometimes echoes a sense of chaos which grabs me.

It's the kind of story of which the prequels were building up all along and always worth a watch.  The final third is handled with a respectful nod to the original trilogy and ties up some nice loose ends.  The film isn't with out it's flaws.  The first half is as bland as anything shown in the rest of the prequels and the new villain in the name of General Grevous is a very weak, goofy, and unnecessary villain to grace the Star Wars saga.  Something which Star Wars had always excelled at otherwise.  Too many villains.  Too many light saber fights.  Too much green screen recuperation.  Still wooden acting at times, and sullen lines.  Still wonky dialogue.  Still too much cleanliness when this tale could possibly do with some gritty real sets to compliment the narrative.

So whilst it goes out with a satisfactory bang, it still doesn't escape criticism.  The key strengths in this film is enough to lift the score I allocate it  to a respectable good rating.  Look out for Ian McDiamids exceptional performance as it's the highlight of the film.  John Williams also does his magic to make this story a tragic and enthralling cinema treat, and a worthy addition to the Star Wars mythos.  This film is better when taken in as a chapter of the entire jigsaw.  The rest of the prequels whilst failing in their own ways do set the plot-line and characters for this film to do something with amazing with.  Watch them first to fully appreciate this chapter.

PS: Oh and very little of Jar Jar and no Ewoks is always a plus point."
"Jan 05, 2013",3,"Good movie, but not a big fan of the theme. This movie is good, but didn't quite live up to the Vader hype, considering that Vader only got 30 seconds of screen time."
"Jan 05, 2013",5,Best of the preliminary three in the Star Wars series
"Jan 05, 2013",4,excellent film loads of action the best out of all of the star wars films great!
"Jan 05, 2013",2.5,i didn't care for this one i think the older ones are the best.
"Jan 05, 2013",4.5,Arguably the best of the first three episodes. Not worth 3D for me however... I can't see it and already have it in HD. we want new Star Wars not re-cuts.
"Jan 05, 2013",3,"not the best, end is good"
"Jan 05, 2013",5,Best of the new three.. Greatest lights average battle.
"Jan 05, 2013",5,The best entry in the franchise.
"Jan 05, 2013",1,"Well, the good part is that there will be no more prequels. There are so many reasons why Lucas has finally and forever f***ed up Star Wars. The tone is everywhere, the script sounds like a child wrote it in one draft without thinking anything threw, the plot is sh!t and laughably bad, and Hayden Christiansen officially holds the award for world's worst actor (yes, beating everyone from Twilight). The only thing good about this film is what is not in this film, and by that I mean things that weren't raped and desolated by being in the prequels, like Chewbacca and Darth Vader. Thankfully the images of Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon remain awesome in our minds and we can sleep soundly knowing they will never stoop so low as to appear in a Star Wars prequel. The only reason I gave this movie one whole star is because of the Emperor, not because of his awful dialogue or service to the plot, it's just because he was so wonderfully evil and he loved it - the only part I sort of enjoyed. The rest can be explained by RedLetterMedia's Mr. Plinkett review of this piece of sh!t - redlettermedia.com - Plinkett reviews."

"Jan 04, 2013",4,"the best star wars film ""you cant miss it"""
"Jan 04, 2013",4.5,"Episode III is perhaps the most emotionally gripping and utterly fascinating of the entire series with the harrowing story of Anakin Skywalker's seduction and subsequent plummet into evil. The performances are staggering, and really help establish a telling story. Although it isn't perfectly written, it is still the most enthralling of the series and its action the most exciting."
"Jan 03, 2013",3.5,Best of the prequels.
"Jan 03, 2013",5,one of the greatest ones bcuz it tied it all together
"Jan 03, 2013",3,The best film of the second trilogy and closet in stature to the originals...
"Jan 03, 2013",4,"The Good:  the opening 20-min is absolutely breathtaking, the final duel with Anakin and Obi-Wan is the best lightsaber duel as it both has awesome style and dramatic heft.  Once Anakin becomes Vader and obliterates the Separatist leaders is the height of awesome geekbumps.
The Bad: Order 66, Jar Jar Binks basically allowing the Empire to form
The Ugly: the romance (sounding like a broken record here), The Emperor's transformation, and every single way saga continuity is broken."

"Jan 01, 2013",2,an alright movie love the battles and general Grievous
"Jan 01, 2013",3.5,"i think this is the better of the three new movies, then two, then one, no one, then two???"
"Jan 01, 2013",5,"OMFG! MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!! I WOULD GIVE THIS MOVIE WAY MORE THAN FIVE STARS!!! AWESOME GRAPHICS, AWESOME FIGHT SCENES, OVERALL AN AWESOME STORYLINE!!!!"
"Jan 01, 2013",4,Volcano-Planet lightsaber battle.
"Jan 01, 2013",2.5,Star Wars back in Business.
"Jan 01, 2013",4,ligtsabers kooollll!
"Jan 01, 2013",2,Depressing - even the ACTING!
"Jan 01, 2013",5,"My absolute favourite movie of all times. Amazing. The Obi-Wan/Vader duel was just perfect. I cried for the last hour when I saw it in the cinema. To this day, I cry when Obi-Wan hears about Qui-Gon."
"Jan 01, 2013",0.5,Would have given zero stars.  Utter drivel and a travesty of wasted opportunity
"Dec 31, 2012",3.5,not as good as the episode 1!
"Dec 31, 2012",5,"Super awesome, fourth best star wars film"
"Dec 31, 2012",1,Best of the remakes but no where near the same class as the originals
"Dec 31, 2012",1.5,poster was better than the movie.
"Dec 31, 2012",3,this movie never measured up to the original trilogy..but still the effects are to be commended
"Dec 30, 2012",5,I think the Star Wars movies set the standard for special effects. This is no exception. My only complaint is the way that Anakin was directed. Too whiney for me.
"Dec 30, 2012",3,A starwars movie. Nuf said.
"Dec 30, 2012",1,only got a star for being a star wars movie
"Dec 30, 2012",5,Probably the best of all the Star Wars movies when it comes to light saber battles.  The story could have maybe used a little bit of work but the action is great.
"Dec 30, 2012",3.5,It is definitely the best of the prequels but if you count the originals it is easily in 4th place
"Dec 30, 2012",2.5,"Probably the least bad of the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy, but still not good."
"Dec 30, 2012",2.5,best of the new ones
"Dec 30, 2012",4,"Lucas finally gets the log out of his butt as he directs an engaging, exciting and very fun movie, something the first two sorely lacked. The acting is far better, the CGI was amazing, the music was bone-chilling and the final fight scene between Anakin and Obi Wan is nothing short of perfect. The best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back."
"Dec 30, 2012",5,GREAT MOVIE MUST SEE
"Dec 30, 2012",1.5,not overly into this movie
"Dec 30, 2012",3.5,"Great CGI, more references, and a great way to end off the Star Wars Saga."
"Dec 30, 2012",4.5,I thought the ending was sad.
"Dec 30, 2012",5,I found this one of the strongest films in the prequels as it has such an amazing and in depth script I yawned at every given moment I ate an m&amp;m with eyes closed and far apart from my TTF throne of yogic super powers it was amazing as I proclaimed my grammar to be perfect and would use this mutant power to intimidation of others and laugh out loud and middle classley proving what a dick I was.
"Dec 30, 2012",0.5,boring watched 20 mins turned off end of
"Dec 30, 2012",4.5,"call me a geek, but this movie its awesome...!!!!"
"Dec 30, 2012",4.5,An inexplicably inspired conclusion for the fans who have been following the prequel trilogy.
"Dec 30, 2012",4,I enjoyed this film and in general I do like the Star Wars films.
"Dec 30, 2012",1,now star wars really does need to be laid to rest at lest
"Dec 29, 2012",5,Almost made up for the first two prequels.  Is the only one that approaches the original movies in any way.
"Dec 29, 2012",1.5,"Horrid, horrid.  It gets one star for the cool fight scene between Obi-Wan and Anikan and 1/2 a star for being Star Wars, but otherwise, it simply sucked."
"Dec 29, 2012",3,"Following repeated viewings, Revenge of the Sith emerges as the best of the prequels by being everything they should have been; not just memorable for individual set pieces. Some of the dialogue is terrible and the set-up for A New Hope feels tacked on, but generally it's a good adventure film in its own right. The balance of The Force isn't quite restored but this has a purpose that Menace and Clones lacks."
"Dec 29, 2012",3,"I have never seen Star Wars as 'special' films, so I was happy with the pretty visuals and loud music."
"Dec 29, 2012",5,I like the star wars films there great to earn 4 and a half stars but i like this one the best and i like how the 3D will be awsome
"Dec 28, 2012",5,Best action sequence ever. Epic fight scene
"Dec 28, 2012",1,I dont like any star wars movie i just like when family guy and american dad makes refrences
"Dec 28, 2012",5,Love Star Wars films
"Dec 28, 2012",2.5,i was expectin it to be better a bit mingin @ da end
"Dec 28, 2012",2,Yuck. I never bought into the love story. What on earth did she see in him? I never saw any chemistry between the actors either. Anakin was a jerk through all the movies. The idea that a grown girl would fall in love with a 10 year old she hadn't seen in a few years is just creepy. Everything felt very staged and preformatted. Huge disapointment for me.
"Dec 28, 2012",4,WHAT CAN YOU SAY !!!!!!!!!!
"Dec 28, 2012",4,Not the best in the Star Wars series.
"Dec 28, 2012",4,This one is the best of the three prequels.
"Dec 28, 2012",3.5,Best of the newer films! You begin to feel the terror of Darth towards the end.
"Dec 28, 2012",5,this movie is great but i really dont follow this movie will lol but the actor the plays dark vator is really hot lol
"Dec 27, 2012",3.5,This was a great edition to the film saga. The best of the prequel trilogy without a doubt. This film follows the end of Anakin Skywalker and the birth of Darth Vader.
"Dec 27, 2012",3,I'm not really into the whole star wars thing
"Dec 27, 2012",4,"Good and entertaining, but since I am a Star Wars fan, I think Lucas could have done a better job."
"Dec 27, 2012",3.5,"Finally bringing back the elements tobring star wars back for what it needs to be.
6.9/10"
"Dec 27, 2012",4,Favorite of the Star Wars movies
"Dec 27, 2012",5,Everythin Star Wars is 5 stars
"Dec 26, 2012",4.5,i don't get how episode I and II could be SO average but this be very good... but star wars episode III is without a doubt the best prequel and is my 3rd favorite star wars film
"Dec 26, 2012",3.5,I LOVE WAR AND FUTURISTIK STAFF.IS RALLY COOL THE BEGINING
"Dec 26, 2012",3,could have been better
"Dec 26, 2012",5,Love how they portray the begging of DArth Vader
"Dec 26, 2012",3,going a bit downhill :(
"Dec 26, 2012",1,Purely awful.  Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman delivered flat delivery combined with a total lack of chemistry that rivals the acting of a cheap porno.  Jar-Jar?  WTF?  George should have left this alone like he should have left the original series alone (why would you throw CGI into a movie filmed in the '70s?).
"Dec 26, 2012",3,Man I think that movie was ok I guess
"Dec 26, 2012",3.5,best of the new Star Wars films
"Dec 26, 2012",3,utter sh*t ending to a good series
"Dec 26, 2012",3,"The best of the first 3 but no way as good as 4,5 and 6"
"Dec 26, 2012",3.5,Should have been better
"Dec 26, 2012",3.5,Umm this movie is all right... hayden christensen just sucks at acting.
"Dec 25, 2012",0.5,I hate star wars with the passion of a thousand fires.
"Dec 25, 2012",4,"Awesome, bets the others by a landslide!!"
"Dec 25, 2012",5,"beautiful, for all star wars fans like myself, i truly loved seeing how the whole saga came together. star wars lives on!"
"Dec 25, 2012",5,"A spectacular and touching space-opera. We might know how it ends, but George Lucas makes this last Star Wars episode as powerful as it could possibly be. The script is emotionnally strong, and Ewan McGregor is a shining."
"Dec 25, 2012",4,NOOOOOOOOO (x1000000000) ...(Had to do it.)
"Dec 25, 2012",4.5,"I liked it, but I thought it would have been a lot different."
"Dec 25, 2012",3,not as good as the rest
"Dec 25, 2012",5,"Apart from the original trilogy, this is the best ending to a trilogy."
"Dec 25, 2012",3.5,alright I suppose. I get confused which star wars is which
"Dec 25, 2012",3.5,well i luv star wars but it could hav been so much better
"Dec 24, 2012",3,couldve been SO much better...
"Dec 24, 2012",1.5,"roflmao use the force luke, wtf???"
"Dec 24, 2012",5,I cannot describe to you how excited I was to see this movie!!! I freakin' loved it!!!!!! BEST MOVIE EVER!!
"Dec 24, 2012",5,"It's so sad, i cried. Yet exciting!"
"Dec 24, 2012",1.5,"Supposedly the best of the prequels, Revenge is stale, boring, and again suffering from the same lack of vision that made all the recent star wars films terrible."
"Dec 24, 2012",3,it was pretty good but by the time this one came out I was kind of sick of um...
"Dec 24, 2012",2.5,I'm partial to the first (last) three
"Dec 24, 2012",3.5,"The acting is slightly better,but this guy is supposed to be DARTH VADER,and he spends half the movie moping and crying,so does his wife.This story really improved,and more of the characters are enjoyable such as Obi Wan.Obi Wan's character is more grounded and developed this time around.The affects are still good looking,but the story gets to be a mess at times.This one was more enjoyable than the others.3.9 stars."
"Dec 24, 2012",2.5,i use thr force regularly
"Dec 24, 2012",5,This is an awesome continuance to the trilogy.
"Dec 24, 2012",4.5,Good. but it is not as good compared to the rest of the Original Trilogy
"Dec 23, 2012",1,"kept me interested, but i dont like star wars that much"
"Dec 23, 2012",5,FUCK YEAH!!! the star wars trilogy are possibly the best films ever made. i love the new ones but they don't even touch the old ones
"Dec 23, 2012",3,At this point I'm like Ehhh!!!!
"Dec 23, 2012",5,Star Wars fan..deal with it
"Dec 22, 2012",5,"The darkest, most powerful, and actually the best since Empire Strikes Back."
"Dec 22, 2012",3.5,Felt sorry for Padme...always hated Anikin
"Dec 22, 2012",5,"Para mí la mejor de la nueva trilogía. Momentos a destacar: la pelea del maestro Yoda y la de Anakin contra Obi-Wan, cuenta con unos efectos especiales deslumbrantes, muy buen trabajo del señor George Lucas."
"Dec 22, 2012",3,alright. not exactly a classic.
"Dec 22, 2012",3.5,"Say what you will, I LIKE the Star Wars prequels."
"Dec 22, 2012",5,the bst star wars eva
"Dec 22, 2012",4,"Obi-wan is the baddest Jedi of all time, and wouldn't wipe his ass with DV's cape"
"Dec 21, 2012",2,DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS MOVIE! But it was entertaining for what it is.
"Dec 21, 2012",5,Very emotional and exciting!
"Dec 20, 2012",1.5,i dont really like the star wars movies.
"Dec 20, 2012",4,"Best of the prequels, but not saying much."
"Dec 20, 2012",1.5,"Damn you George Lucas, you destroyed my childhood with these new movies :("
"Dec 20, 2012",4.5,Yep! deffinetly a good one
"Dec 19, 2012",4,We'll give it a 4. Lucas should have done much much better with Episodes 1-3 but he let us down. Still get to see the starting of Darth.
"Dec 19, 2012",4,"None of the light saber duels were long enough to be able to surpass Darth Maul versus Qui Gonn and Obi Wan from the 1st episode, but it was an excellent bridge between the first episodes and the older, last three."
"Dec 19, 2012",5,"love Darth Vader, so this one's epic"
"Dec 19, 2012",4.5,"Star Wars III: Revenge Of The Sith, finally hits where the other two missed and bring us the best chapter of this second trilogy and, although not bigger than any of the episodes of the original trilogy, it is just next to be just like it."
"Dec 19, 2012",3.5,Its ok but i dont get it
"Dec 19, 2012",3,"This film continues to be better than its predecessor, although I still felt the CGI was over used and the (cough) ""love story"" was still unbelievable, this film was better than SWII. The acting is the best in this film out of all the prequels (not counting Liam Neeson) the story is interesting and we really get to see character development in the film, and of course the rise of Darth Vader, who is quite possible one if the most iconic villains of media of all time. That in and of itself made this one worth it, and it is by far the best of the prequels."
"Dec 18, 2012",3,It was an okay film for a prequel.
"Dec 18, 2012",5,Loving the movie like the action and drama scenes.
"Dec 18, 2012",1.5,onli watch it once got bored feel assleep
"Dec 17, 2012",3,Bad acting but good lightsaber duels!
"Dec 17, 2012",0.5,never could watch a full show of Star Wars...dull
"Dec 17, 2012",4.5,"action packed, special effects are just some of the things that are squeezed into this boxoffice film"
"Dec 17, 2012",3.5,A good close to the epic series.
"Dec 17, 2012",1.5,This movie completely ruined the characterization of the rest of the movies for me.
"Dec 17, 2012",3,"As much as I loath the ridiculousness of this movie, its still Star Wars."
"Dec 16, 2012",1.5,"Plot and characters are atrocious, but the fights are alright and visually appealing. It's fun if you turn off you're brain I guess. Just remember to turn it back on afterwords (assuming you actually wanna watch this crap)."
"Dec 16, 2012",3.5,Definitely the best of the prequels. This episode ties the first two trilogies together and guides you down the path to darkness alongside Anakin Skywalker telling the tale of how he became Darth Vader.
"Dec 16, 2012",4.5,By far the best of the prequels
"Dec 16, 2012",3,it was wat i expected
"Dec 15, 2012",2.5,"Good, not great, definetely fun."
"Dec 15, 2012",3.5,the only good thing about Hayden Christenson was when he became Darth Vader
"Dec 15, 2012",5,HAVE TO LOVE THIS ONE JERONS FAVORIT LOL
"Dec 15, 2012",5,Best STARWARS  movie. This one joins the saga .
"Dec 15, 2012",4,"I like star wars, except episode I"
"Dec 14, 2012",4,i like episode 4-6 the best.
"Dec 14, 2012",5,"A
The gem of Lucas's prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith ties everything together in an amazing way. The movie picks up at the end of the Clone Wars. Lucas uses his CGI technology to create some of the best looking animated characters and worlds that we've seen in any Star Wars movie so far. I could go on and on about how great this movie is, but one thing that it does better than any of the past Star Wars movies are the lightsaber fights. It has four incredible lightsaber fights that will keep happy throughout the entire movie. The fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is exactly the fight we've been waiting for. The plot is great and the cast does an amazing job. Everything in this movie is awesome and it is a stunning conclusion to the Star Wars saga."
"Dec 14, 2012",4.5,"Okay, it's not as good as the original three (V-VII) but it's Starwars for goodness sakes.  These were the best movies ever created."
"Dec 14, 2012",4,"I remember when I was 10, my grandmother took me and my brother to the movies to see this. 
It's the final part of the Anakin Skywalker story, and it is the last movie overall. Don't kill me, but I'm not a huge Star Wars fan or anything. BUT there is an exception: Computer graphics and digital effects. What more can I tell you? It's pleasing to the eyes!"
"Dec 14, 2012",5,It was a great way to do this movie darth vader is awesome
"Dec 14, 2012",3,"I love Star Wars (eps IV- VII) but this film seriously lets itself down.

Not quite as bad as AotC though."
"Dec 13, 2012",1,"This was so bad, did not live up to my expectations."
"Dec 13, 2012",3,Wasnt good but it had a meaning too it
"Dec 13, 2012",3,"Do you remeber when star wars was awsome, and relied on acting and plot to rock?"
"Dec 13, 2012",4.5,Really cool movie with awsome effects!
"Dec 12, 2012",5,i love hayden christensen as drath vader
"Dec 12, 2012",5,"sad yet, always amazing and always will be, the best."
"Dec 12, 2012",3,Something was a bit off...maybe it was the directing?
"Dec 12, 2012",5,"OK... TWO WORDS...
LIGHT SABER!"
"Dec 12, 2012",3,"Best of the new trilogy, but thats not saying much."
"Dec 12, 2012",3,"Not a big Star Wars person -- I go b/c I enjoy my movie companion! 
_\--/"
"Dec 11, 2012",4.5,"I love this movie, but some of the acting in it is terrible !!!"
"Dec 11, 2012",5,The reason why I started watching movies.
"Dec 11, 2012",5,"UNFREAKIN REAL ,I NEVER KNEW WHO DARTH VADER WAZ UNTIL NOW"
"Dec 11, 2012",4,Easily the best of the prequel trilogy.
"Dec 11, 2012",2,i'm not sure if i saw this or not....but it probably sucked.
"Dec 11, 2012",3,Everthing after empire strikes back was a waste!
"Dec 10, 2012",4,Hayden Christensen is HOT!
"Dec 10, 2012",4.5,good advanture movie
"Dec 10, 2012",5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Dec 10, 2012",0.5,"Whiny Ani makes me cringe, only good part was when he finally shuts up for five minutes and takes out the kids."
"Dec 10, 2012",3.5,Star Wars is always cool
"Dec 09, 2012",4.5,"not the best of the entire saga, but the best of the prequel trilogy for sure. it connects all the dots, as it should. It's a satisfying movie, and worth watching a few more times"
"Dec 09, 2012",4,Even thought its not the best movie ever its still Star Wars
"Dec 09, 2012",5,Does this need an explanation?
"Dec 09, 2012",5,"Possibly THE best of the Saga, thats against 5 other brilliant films. Everything clicks into place here, with fantastic emotion."
"Dec 09, 2012",1,i havent seen it before but it looks good
"Dec 08, 2012",3.5,not as good as the orginal star wars movies
"Dec 08, 2012",5,The best Star Wars movie of the 6. Just nudging the Empire Strikes Back.
"Dec 08, 2012",3,"O.K., but Christiansen is SO bad!!!"
"Dec 08, 2012",4.5,best of the new ones by a long way
"Dec 07, 2012",3,Great effects-Just never was a big star wars fan
"Dec 07, 2012",5,How many shocks would I get?
"Dec 07, 2012",3,"Grievous is cool, the story is a bit more focused than those of the other prequels and Anakin's fall and transformation is surprisingly dark and gory - just the way we wanted it - but it still can't erase the bittersweet taste of ""Phantom Menace"" and even ""Attack of the Clones.""  I can understand his technology-based reasons for waiting so long to do the prequels, but I don't think Star Wars fans would have minded some old-fashioned stop-motion and miniature-reliant effects if these prequels had been made earlier, perhaps at a time when it wouldn't have taken so much to rebuild the audience's enthusiasm and the stakes wouldn't have been quite so high."
"Dec 07, 2012",3.5,"Despite what all the geeks say, I thought this movie was great."
"Dec 07, 2012",3.5,is good film i have watched all of them and enjoyed them all.
"Dec 07, 2012",4,frigen star wars enough said
"Dec 07, 2012",3,Coulda been better. But still good.
"Dec 06, 2012",4,Back to being great star wars with lot of action dark themes. B+
"Dec 06, 2012",3,"good, but the originals were better"
"Dec 06, 2012",5,"I'm a Star Wars nerd... seriouly. We own all the movies on DVD and I've seen it about a hundred times. Yup, I'm a fanatic! Hee hee..."
"Dec 06, 2012",3.5,"The best of the prequel bunch but still cannot hold a candle to the original trilogy. Hayden Christiansen has to be one of the weakest actors ever to ""grace"" the silver screen. Certainly since Jake Lloyd. The casting director should have been fired."
"Dec 05, 2012",3,"Finally the Vader transformation!  Still not as good as A New Hope or Empire, but a marked improvement over Jedi."
"Dec 05, 2012",4.5,May the force be with you.
"Dec 05, 2012",3.5,"It delivers everything you want. From emotion, to epic confrontations and battles between characters, to an exciting atmosphere. Sure, it's made from very expensive cheese and cornily written to make you smirk, and acted to make SNL look serious, and makes hardcore Star Wars fans cringe, but from all those goofs and as little pure artistry as this film has, the movie's pure entertainment just made me sit back and enjoy the ride."
"Dec 05, 2012",4,my favorite film of 8th grade. i would come home from school and watch this movie at least twice a week
"Dec 05, 2012",0.5,oh god... so... very... bad...
"Dec 05, 2012",4,"It was kind of boring, but it completed the story."
"Dec 05, 2012",4,It has a really hot guy in it.
"Dec 05, 2012",2.5,the acting was too cheesy and the book was better
"Dec 04, 2012",5,....oh shit...that shit was off the chain
"Dec 04, 2012",5,of course it was good
"Dec 04, 2012",3,coud have been done better
"Dec 04, 2012",3.5,"AWESOME special effects, but lacking in story and acting"
"Dec 04, 2012",2.5,"It didn't suck as bad as the previous 2 prequels, but it was still pretty lame in parts."
"Dec 04, 2012",3,Not really into star wars
"Dec 04, 2012",5,"You were the choosen one, I LOVED YOU!"
"Dec 04, 2012",4.5,"Loved it... A few iffy spots, but overall a good movie."
"Dec 04, 2012",5,"det är ju star wars, kan inte vara nått annat än bra"
"Dec 04, 2012",4.5,"Excellent, definatly my favorite from episoded 1-3."
"Dec 04, 2012",1.5,was'nt too impressed not really a star wars fan
"Dec 03, 2012",4.5,"ugh. in the words of Yoda, 'such a nerd, I am.'"
"Dec 03, 2012",3,"Just not the same as the original trilogy, but ewan mcgregor was gud"
"Dec 03, 2012",5,easily the best of the 'new' trilogy
"Dec 03, 2012",5,The Star Wars Saga is one of the greatest series of movies ever made. Episode III connects the first trilogy with its prequel by telling the story of how good turned into evil. It's awesome!
"Dec 02, 2012",4,I watched this 3 times in theaters. I thought it was pretty awesome.
"Dec 02, 2012",2.5,The guy was a whinny b***h and you expect me to believe that he turns in to Darth Vader.
"Dec 01, 2012",5,"best of the new trilogy,a fitting end to the star wars saga"
"Dec 01, 2012",4,best out of the three
"Nov 30, 2012",2,i dont remember if i watched it. i think so
"Nov 30, 2012",2.5,it good special graph on the movie and storyline.
"Nov 30, 2012",3,"Good movie, good cast, love Ewan McGregor but still I prefer the first Star Wars trilogy."
"Nov 29, 2012",0.5,a cardboard box had better actors
"Nov 29, 2012",4.5,By far my favorite one out of the second trilogy.
"Nov 29, 2012",1,the best of the worst
"Nov 29, 2012",1,I thought it was boring
"Nov 28, 2012",5,Loved the action and story rocked
"Nov 28, 2012",5,"Once again George Lucas has used his creative talent and imagination to create a masterpiece, in what is probaly the best conclusion to the best epilogue series ever made. Wonder acting and good character"
"Nov 28, 2012",2.5,"I'm stuck on the first 3... the ""prequels"" just don't excite me as much."
"Nov 28, 2012",5,"in my opinion, the best star wars movie of the series"
"Nov 27, 2012",5,it was a good movie to
"Nov 27, 2012",2.5,"i like star wars, but haydn wats-his-face is goreous"
"Nov 27, 2012",2.5,Saw this Star Wars and i will never se it again! In my eyes the original three are the best!
"Nov 27, 2012",3,"probably one of ther ""better"" if that's a good word, of the new three."
"Nov 27, 2012",4,Not usually a starwars fan but I did like this one. Was interesting to see the story of Darth Vader.
"Nov 27, 2012",5,Seriously made up for the first two of the new trilogy.
"Nov 27, 2012",3.5,Thank God the trilogy ended on a strong note
"Nov 26, 2012",2.5,I'm glad that we've all just stopped trying and have come to terms that this is what Star Wars is now.
"Nov 26, 2012",5,Star wars rocks and how fit is anikin!!!!!
"Nov 26, 2012",2.5,nice graphics. built up just a little too much
"Nov 25, 2012",5,Best of the new Trilogy!
"Nov 25, 2012",2,he killed padmai she was hot
"Nov 25, 2012",3.5,Not as good as the original stories but best of the prequels.
"Nov 25, 2012",1,this was a lame movie
"Nov 25, 2012",5,YES!!! he is so hott!!!
"Nov 25, 2012",5,itz goin to b awezome
"Nov 25, 2012",4.5,Well this movie was good even though i never episode l or ll
"Nov 24, 2012",4,Star Wars is the best!
"Nov 24, 2012",2,Unintentional comedy gold.
"Nov 24, 2012",3.5,"Not being an avid die-hard Star Wars fan (but a fan all the same) I found this final installment of the prequel trilogy satisfying compared to movies I and II, being darker and more emotional. That none of the prequels were able to live up to the greatness of the originals needs no questioning, but like most people I consider this movie the best of the prequels, albeit wooden dialogues (and acting for some) and a rather banal script (sorry). But it wasn't banal all the way- the action scenes toward the climax actually kept my eyes glued to the screen and some scenes were heartbreaking, all building up towards a considerably satisfying closure. Outstanding score composed by John Williams wins it all."
"Nov 24, 2012",3.5,The best of the prequels. But it's still one of the prequels.
"Nov 24, 2012",3.5,"the best star wars movie... but not the best movie in the world, im not a star wars fanatic."
"Nov 24, 2012",4.5,"Uncomparable special effects, further improved acting (though Christiansen still doesn't hit the mark) and a spectacular finale, episode III is a fitting end to the Star Wars saga."
"Nov 23, 2012",5,Tied in very well with the early films
"Nov 23, 2012",3,I suppose it's good if its the original Star Wars trilogy
"Nov 23, 2012",4,its star wars enough said
"Nov 23, 2012",3.5,"Good. Some bad acting, and makeup. Liked the fact Lucas tried to downplay the ""chosen one"" theme. Was glad to hear James' voice, not someone elses."
"Nov 22, 2012",2.5,I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
"Nov 22, 2012",4,by far the best of the prequels and a very satisfying story to tie the two trilogies together. some of the acting is a bit spotty
"Nov 22, 2012",4,"Here's my hierarchy: 5, 4, 3, 6,2,and 1. On a side note, I saw this in D.C. with my friends Will and John. For the rest fo the night Will demonstrated is talent at immitating Star     Wars characters. Oh, and we answered the question, what would happen if Superman was hit by a lightsaber. If a lightsaber can cut through durasteel and Superman is merely the Man of Steel, he would be sliced in half. Enough said."
"Nov 22, 2012",4.5,Great way to end the trilogy.
"Nov 21, 2012",5,"Awesome effects, loved the love story conflict"
"Nov 21, 2012",4,"Finally saved the Prequel with a decent story.  Dialogue was still a bit week, but the transformation into Darth Vader was epic."
"Nov 20, 2012",4,Truly wasted potential but still a satisfying film
"Nov 19, 2012",5,another classic but this is tons better
"Nov 19, 2012",4.5,"good tie up to the saga, could have been better, still awesome though."
"Nov 19, 2012",3,My favorite Star Wars movie.
"Nov 19, 2012",4,"The third film of the series's chronology, the finale of the release, and one of the best in the series"
"Nov 18, 2012",3,Star Wars WILL never get old. Great movie.
"Nov 18, 2012",2.5,"Probably the best of the prequels, but that's not really saying much."
"Nov 18, 2012",5,Como todos os filmes do Star Wars eh simplesmente incrivel!
"Nov 17, 2012",2.5,"seen it, its not bad"
"Nov 17, 2012",3.5,"Unlike its previous prequel installments, this chapter in the galactic saga ensures a more focused and dark themes, making it feel more like a genuine Star Wars entry, and while it's improvements are mostly noticeable, some particular elements from the previous two are preserved, such as poor character development and sloppy direction, not to mention the already obnoxious over use of special effects, which holds the film to go beyond as a truly worthy episode in the franchise."
"Nov 17, 2012",5,loved the star wars all the way
"Nov 17, 2012",4,its better than the rest
"Nov 15, 2012",1,only good star wars is the classic ones everything else basically a repeat
"Nov 15, 2012",5,The Jedi have fallen
"Nov 14, 2012",0.5,Didn't really like this one.
"Nov 13, 2012",0.5,never liked dis series
"Nov 13, 2012",3.5,not as good as I thought it was going to be
"Nov 13, 2012",0.5,yeah right haha not a star wars person
"Nov 12, 2012",3.5,not as good as i expeted.
"Nov 12, 2012",5,"This Is one PIMPIN"" FFLICK YO.....LOL"
"Nov 12, 2012",5,My most favorite movie.
"Nov 12, 2012",5,best film i have seen in ages
"Nov 12, 2012",2.5,Ha! Ripsnorter of a finale.
"Nov 11, 2012",4,one of the best one's yet
"Nov 11, 2012",4.5,a monumental ending to the epic.
"Nov 11, 2012",4.5,"Great way to end things....oh wait we have 7,8,9 coming soon WOOO!"
"Nov 11, 2012",3.5,I liked this one but thought that it could have been better. Still it was a very entertaining movie.
"Nov 10, 2012",5,Best of all the star wars movies
"Nov 10, 2012",4,Loved the action and the continued story line..or rather the missing story line..ie. the original star wars trilogy.
"Nov 10, 2012",5,"Tras dos películas un poco irregulares en su trama, en ""Star Wars: Episodio III - La Venganza de los Sith"" cambió todo totalmente: una historia trágica, personajes más entretenidos y efectos especiales realmente muy impresionantes. Está al nivel de las dos primeras películas de la trilogía original, pudiendo ser una de las mejores películas de la gran saga."
"Nov 10, 2012",4,Everyone will love it
"Nov 09, 2012",5,"very intens, i liked it"
"Nov 08, 2012",5,i'm a geek but i love umm
"Nov 08, 2012",4,yes I am a star wars geek
"Nov 08, 2012",5,"Revenge of the Sith is truly and arguably the greatest Star Wars of all time and in 2005. I am saying this because this ties all the Star Wars movies all together and it is the most mature Star Wars movie ever; it has wookies, five lightsaber battles, Darth Vader getting burned alive on planet mustafar, and even dictatorship. Episode III is a must-see and it has the clone wars in it; in the first Star Wars movie (in general), the Clone Wars was referenced. Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan resembles Alec Guinness, Vader's wife Padme gives birth to Luke and Leia because we get to fully understand that Luke and Leia are brother and sister, we get to see the Jedi being massacred by Stormtroopers (once Clone Troopers in the Clone Wars), and we even get to see Darth Sidious get his facial scars and become the evil emperor. Furthermore, we get to fully understand that Vader is Luke's father after all. My most favorite part of the movie is when Vader gets his mask and body suit for the first time in Star Wars History.

Despite those stupid criticisms from so many people, Episode III is a great move to see. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas' Friend, said this is a fantastic Star Wars movie and I fully agree with him. The Wookies should have been in Return of the Jedi rather than the ridiculous Ewoks. I wish George Lucas would have given the Wookies more screen time in Revenge of the Sith but he did a great job with Episode III. This is my favorite Star Wars movie along with Empire Strikes back even if some stupid critics or moviegoers say it is inferior along with Episode I and II."
"Nov 08, 2012",5,"da best of the starwars films's. I loved that r2d2 was darth vader in the end.

legit!"
"Nov 07, 2012",5,best star wars prequel
"Nov 07, 2012",5,I Hope it looks even better in 3D. Which really doesn't matter. Still a great movie.
"Nov 07, 2012",5,"After re watching this the other night this is one of the best Star Wars films. The whole movie is great, the whole story of just watching Anakin turning to the dark side is great. It's the best of the prequels but not of the whole series. The only down fall is the acting, it's horrible certain scenes when they talk about serious things it's just acted horribly but that aside it's a great movie. Of course the end is the best part!"
"Nov 07, 2012",4,not bad good fight scences
"Nov 07, 2012",3.5,"Easily the best in the series, Revenge of the Sith is fast-paced, action-packed, eye-grabbing fun."
"Nov 06, 2012",5,Best movie i've ever watched
"Nov 06, 2012",2.5,Don't like Star Wars that much lol
"Nov 06, 2012",1,"Great cast, what a waste."
"Nov 06, 2012",3,didnt like that he almost diesd at the end
"Nov 06, 2012",3.5,"This is a fun film, it's not great, but it's a fun ride.  The acting is not good, but the story works for the most part."
"Nov 05, 2012",0.5,don't know and don't like it
"Nov 05, 2012",3,"The best of the new Trilogy, which I don't hate like many others."
"Nov 05, 2012",4.5,"Lucas, despite his many shortcomings, is still a solid director."
"Nov 04, 2012",2.5,"visually pleasing and some cool fight scenes, but still not enough to save this sub par movies"
"Nov 04, 2012",4,Buena pero hasta cierto punto (los jedi los presentan como unos puercos)
"Nov 04, 2012",3,"It did excite and thrill me at the initial viewings, I'll give it that much credit. But didn't survive long after. And visual effects now have become so saturated and cartoony(without the grit or grime) that the actors look more out of the place."
"Nov 04, 2012",5,Geoge lucas did it again making the film that is heavy on story and dark in atmosphere
"Nov 04, 2012",1.5,never really liked star wars
"Nov 04, 2012",4,"Le meilleur des trois nouveaux, mais il a du mal a sauver la trilogie des deux daubes precedentes."
"Nov 04, 2012",3.5,The Best Of The New Three But Still Not Anywhere Near As Good As Any Of The Originals
"Nov 04, 2012",3,Best of the prequels
"Nov 04, 2012",4,4/5. This is the best of the prequel Star Wars trilogy.
"Nov 04, 2012",1,Horrible sham of a movie.  Lucas has succeeded in destroying one of the best franchise's of all time.
"Nov 03, 2012",3,The only film needed of this trilogy
"Nov 03, 2012",4,"This one is my favorite one of all of them, because there is so much emotion and believability, that this truly tops them all."
"Nov 03, 2012",3,Better than the previous prequels.
"Nov 02, 2012",3,"Revenge Of The Sith is alot better than the previous films due to better storytelling and more creativity towards the story focusing more on Anikan turning in to Darth Vader, although it can be dull and slow at points which can drag the film down, it still manges to bring a solid story to life with better emotion and action than the previous two films had, Revenge Of The Sith is just barely a solid hit."
"Nov 01, 2012",2.5,"I just don't like Hayden Christensen. Period. I love McGregor, but just not Christensen. TOO MUCH CGI."
"Nov 01, 2012",4.5,Great way to close the Star Wars film series. (I would have liked to see Jar Jar Binks die though)
"Nov 01, 2012",4,if ur a star wars fan youll like it
"Nov 01, 2012",4,"I really loved this movie for two reasons. First reasons is because of the forbidden love that Anakin Skywalker has with Padme Amidala. For it shows that even if he was to turn to the dark side of the force, he was the victim of Emperor Palpatine and his love for Amidala was genuine. Second reason was to show the origin of Darth Vader."
"Nov 01, 2012",4,Anikan could a should a been at least a little more awesome than how he was played out in the new set of 3 movies. Only buy it if its with the saga
"Nov 01, 2012",1,ive never seen it but all star wars movies are gay
"Oct 31, 2012",2.5,"The best of the new 3, but still painfully awful."
"Oct 31, 2012",5,damn i loved this movie
"Oct 31, 2012",3,"A much depressing film by all means, and one that sets the story that fueled the originals."
"Oct 31, 2012",3.5,"While it's far better than the other two prequels, it's still loads away from living up to the original trilogy."
"Oct 31, 2012",4,star wars...loved them since i was a kid
"Oct 31, 2012",3,At least it ended on a good note.
"Oct 31, 2012",2.5,"Though the best of the prequels, it still carries the stench of uselessness."
"Oct 30, 2012",5,"Watching Anakin turn into Darth Vader was done so very well, by far my favorite of all the Star Wars"
"Oct 30, 2012",5,"What can I say, I am a Star Wars dork."
"Oct 30, 2012",2,Really good. I am a fan of the star wars trilogy. Especially when the actor who plays Anakin Skywalker looks like that! lol.
"Oct 30, 2012",4,it should be 5 stars but something happened and they changed my rating
"Oct 29, 2012",4,"The most anticipated Star Wars movie since the originals. This one was pretty damned good. By far my favorite and the best in the prequel trilogy. It is the darkest and most tragic in the series, as we finally get to see Anakin's inevitable fate, and for the first time since the originals, we see one of the baddest villains of all time, Darth Vader. Sure, we only get to see him for a few minutes, and he only gets a few lines, but it's a pleasure to see him at all. (NOOOOOOOOO!!!!) The movie was pretty epic, and rather than just more gratuitous CGI like the last two films, each scene in this one felt important, and the effects complement the story. This one definitely had the most action, and the fastest pace. More lightsaber fights than we can ask for, each of them were epic in their own way, until we finally get to the climatic duel between Obi-Wan and Anakin, what every fan has been waiting to see. I always wondered how they would handle the Jedi purge, and how the clones would end up being the storm troopers we know so well. This explains it all. I found Order 66 to be a very clever idea, and it shows that the Jedi are not so invulnerable after all. Countless were killed across the galaxy, and it was very sad to watch. The most difficult one to bare by far was the killing of the younglings, which was off screen, otherwise, the film would have been rated R. This one had the darkest ending, and when we get to it, we see why the next one is called ""A New Hope"". I like how nicely it segues into Episode IV, and ties up all of the loose ends perfectly. Episode III completes and connects the Star Wars saga after three decades. A few things to nitpick here and there, but overall, a very good film. This film was closest to the originals, and redeemed the whole prequel trilogy. There are some who don't like this one along with the other prequel films, but I believe it deserves a place in the saga."
"Oct 29, 2012",4,"great movie; however, I think the storyline could have been more exciting from the beginning. Unlike the original 3 episodes the beginning was rather slow. Overall, good movie!"
"Oct 29, 2012",4,"All of the prequels may have been terrible, but out of all of them, the one I dislike the least is this one. The suspense is great, the action is great, the build-up for the empire is great, and this is one of the great prequel films ever made... to me anyway."
"Oct 29, 2012",4,Why wasn't this parts 1 thru 3?
"Oct 29, 2012",1,"1st 3 episodes much, much better."
"Oct 29, 2012",4,i dont like star wars but this movie is good!!
"Oct 28, 2012",2,2 cuz star wars was pimp back in the day
"Oct 28, 2012",2,Was not a fan of these movies.
"Oct 28, 2012",4,Thank goodness! something relatively good came out of Lucas's madness
"Oct 27, 2012",4,"Actually a good movie! I loved the very ending. But the acting makes you squirm though, eeewwwwee...."
"Oct 27, 2012",3,Could have been more coherent
"Oct 27, 2012",5,"Anything out of this world gets my attention, action and mystery plus intrigue"
"Oct 27, 2012",4,Very dark finale to the prequel trilogy but the story is good (especially in the second half) and really sets up the original movie well.  No lines from Jar Jar was also a huge plus.
"Oct 26, 2012",4.5,Once again good but not the greatest. Darth Vader is the ultimate Bad Ass.
"Oct 25, 2012",2.5,"really good action, really bad acting"
"Oct 25, 2012",5,its star wars so you know its tight
"Oct 25, 2012",4,Of the prequel series this one is vastly superior. It has some truly memorable moments. The climactic battle between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader was amazing! One of the final scene's having Anakin being fitted with Vader's suit... just amazing! It ties up most of the loose ends left in the series. With one of the only negatives being Lucas' dialogue again.
"Oct 25, 2012",5,"My favorite of all, really tells the whole saga!"
"Oct 24, 2012",4.5,"You know for all the crap people give the prequels.. They're actually not all that bad :/ 
I have to say out of all the Star Wars movies, this is probably my favorite because of how it tied up the whole series and because I love john williams score for it"
"Oct 24, 2012",3,its ok but bit stale
"Oct 24, 2012",0.5,i dont like alot of star wars
"Oct 24, 2012",4,The better of the new Star Wars with a good fight at the end
"Oct 23, 2012",3.5,Seen it. Was good if you are into Star Wars.
"Oct 23, 2012",5,My favourite of the Star Wars franchise in which we see the transformation of young Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader!  It is an epic conclusion to George Lucas's amazing saga!  Can't say enough good about this movie.  It  definitely makes up for the unsuccessful prequels.  Still one of my fav movies to this day!
"Oct 22, 2012",4,The best of the Prequels
"Oct 22, 2012",5,The rise of vader. Great movie
"Oct 22, 2012",0.5,"Better than Attack of the Clones, which means absolutely nothing."
"Oct 21, 2012",4.5,"A perfect action drama sci fi. The turning of good to evil and love as well as revenge blended together into a near perfect movie. Thank you George Lucas, for this gift to our generation."
"Oct 21, 2012",4,"DIE OBI-WAN,jaga jaga!"
"Oct 21, 2012",4.5,"One of the most under rated Star Wars. It's a gripping end to the prequel tragedy of Skywalker. Enfolds political corruption, fallen love and betrayal of friendship. The acting is subpar but which Star Wars isn't?"
"Oct 20, 2012",1,a load of tedious old balderdash
"Oct 20, 2012",5,love it one of my all time favs
"Oct 20, 2012",5,Go out and get the DVD....like now!
"Oct 20, 2012",4,Best star wars movie in my opinion.. Great action and adventure..
"Oct 20, 2012",4.5,I loved this movie so much! this is an inpovement to attack of the clones. i will make my top 10 movies of all time list (coming soon) i watch this when i was 6 years old when it came out on dvd. the music in this is good i will say thanks to john willans for making the music in this.
"Oct 19, 2012",3,se me hace aun muy setentera
"Oct 18, 2012",5,F))$()$&amp;$6?ing Awesome easily number 2 in the saga could argue 3 but I say 2
"Oct 18, 2012",4,The best of the new ones...
"Oct 18, 2012",3.5,the originals are the best
"Oct 17, 2012",3.5,The movie is pretty cool. Obi-Wan and the Emperor carry the story. Hayden simply CANNOT ACT. I hate every word that comes out of his mouth. Its like he is reading from note cards. This movie would be better if it made us actually care about Anakin. I mean I do. But not because of this movie...
"Oct 16, 2012",1.5,What's wrong with your face?
"Oct 16, 2012",3,I saw the original 3 in movie theatres when I was young.  I took my son to these newer ones and I got the sense he wasn't nearly as impressed as I was at his age but I liked this one better than ep. 1 and 2
"Oct 16, 2012",3.5,"(SPOILERS)

It's better than Return of the Jedi, but not even close to A New Hope or Empire. It delivered where it really needed to, and I think I liked it more because I hated Attack of the Clones so much. Probably the darkest Star Wars movie, but definitely not actually DARK. It reminds us what SW really was. A great sci-fi movie series, with a tongue-in-cheek tone at times, but also with nice splash of ""oh man, he's choking that guy to death with nothing!"" 

The final scene was worthy of Darth Vader's character, although I must say that a bit more character development was needed to turn Hayden Penn from the complaining, angsty teenage Jedi into a character that is as cold as Vader is. Hayden's Anakin just talks far too much and is too young to truly be Vader... only when he is burning and screams ""I HATE YOU!!"" to Obi-Wan do we truly see him START to transform into the true Vader. Simply put, Hayden Penn is just not Darth Vader.

All in all, this movie gave us what we wanted and was worthy of the franchise we so love, in my opinion. :D"
"Oct 15, 2012",3,I would have loved it if not for the insipid dialogue
"Oct 15, 2012",4,"Clearly the best one out of all the prequel films,not as many plot holes in this one."
"Oct 15, 2012",1.5,"What a crock of shit this movie was. Also, POWER!!! UNLIMITED POWER!!! That scene alone is why this movie is laughably pathetic."
"Oct 15, 2012",3,Get rid of jar jar binks!
"Oct 14, 2012",5,my opinion is this is the best of all the series
"Oct 14, 2012",5,I like that they change the ending to match the new movies
"Oct 14, 2012",3.5,I though it had more action
"Oct 13, 2012",3,If it wasn't for the awful script and wooden acting this can be compared with empire strikes back for the best in the series.
"Oct 13, 2012",5,i realy liked this one
"Oct 13, 2012",5,best of the new star wars
"Oct 13, 2012",4,Why did George feel it was necessary to mess with formula from the orginal series.
"Oct 13, 2012",2,"Disappointing. Just like the two other prequels, this one had the potenttial, but Lucas screwed his franchise up Big Time. Anakin didn't even have to be this big space-jesus, he just needed to be the badass we all knew from The Empire Strikes Back, not a whiney bitch who is mad and can't take a single hint from Palpatine. There were literally too many plotholes in this movie for me to explain all of them. But I still gave it 2 stars: 1 for the brilliant performances of Samuel l. jackson and Ian McDiarmid. The other star because of the amazing score in this film."
"Oct 13, 2012",4,"well... i the special effects rocks with all those glowing swords, i mean its Star Wars"""
"Oct 12, 2012",4.5,"This definitely the best of the prequels since everything has been improved since the previous two films. The story is compelling and better written, action scenes are even more thrilling, the music is more epic, the special effects are better, the acting is better, there's some actual emotion to be felt, and overall it's just an excellent film."
"Oct 12, 2012",3,The special effects and the visuals of the movie are stunning. However the story is simple and some of it doesn't make sense. The acting is horrible. It's like a 8 year old wrote the lines.
"Oct 12, 2012",3,"maganda sna kung gein ulit nla ung 4,5&amp;6"
"Oct 11, 2012",3,The Only Star Wars Film That Is My Favorite Is Episode IV.
"Oct 11, 2012",4,"hehe, love the starwars"
"Oct 11, 2012",4.5,The best of the new 3.
"Oct 10, 2012",1.5,"The Emperor's return to the big screen is welcoming, but every other character in this film is boring, trite, and portrayed in such comical ways it's downright silly. As a wrap-up to the backstory of Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith fails in just about every attempt to connect with the audience on an emotional level, and overall creates a big, ugly stain on the mythology of the franchise."
"Oct 10, 2012",3,slight disappoining you expect to much from it but dont get enough
"Oct 10, 2012",2.5,(Sigh) Disappointed...but i shed a tear or two at the end....
"Oct 10, 2012",4,Didn't see this either
"Oct 10, 2012",4.5,"Better than I thought it would be.  It tied up loose ends, but Hayden was still a bad choice for the role."
"Oct 10, 2012",4.5,The best star wars episode ever!
"Oct 09, 2012",5,Under rated. It is the darkest Star Wars one has seen Star Wars. Unless you are a nostalgia junkie one must admit this is a great movie. It is emotionally gripping especially in the scene saying you were the chosen one. This is new gods mythology that might one day cast mythology of the old. Star Wars are the new Greek gods...
"Oct 09, 2012",3,"The stale acting, bad CGI and terrible writing remain from the previous films, but Revenge of the Sith has entertaining sequences and a great third act that ties well to the original trilogy, which raises it out of terribleness and thus becomes the best of the prequel trilogy...not that it's saying much."
"Oct 08, 2012",4,"Revenge of the Sith proves to be the best amongst Lucas' prequel trilogy, with a tone more along the lines of the originals."
"Oct 08, 2012",1.5,It's okay but I would never watch it again
"Oct 07, 2012",5,"There's a ton of action, but some really touching moments too. I was bawling through a lot of it, because it's really sad."
"Oct 07, 2012",2.5,Revenge of the Sith has ludicrous dialogue and a few unintentionally hilarious scenes.
"Oct 07, 2012",5,"Epic! Just Epic! My favourite in the Prequel Trilogy by far! One of my favourie film's of all time! However... There are still a few problems with it, &amp; things that don't line up that well with the OT, but I still love it!"
"Oct 05, 2012",4.5,Love love Star Wars!
"Oct 05, 2012",5,One of the Better Star Wars Flicks!
"Oct 05, 2012",3,I'm a sucker for lightsabers.
"Oct 04, 2012",4,"The new trilogy, this is the best movie. Not far from the second, but we must agree that the climactic final battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan is very good. I finish watching the new trilogy on Blu-Ray with a sense that these films could have been much better, and I know that most people will agree with me on this. Still, it's Star Wars. Who is in love with the series can not hate (perhaps only Episode I, lol)."

"Oct 01, 2012",0.5,"It's shocking how poor this is. Hayden Christensen does not work as either a formidable or evil force, neither does the film. Almost everything but the visuals fail."
"Oct 01, 2012",4,Going to the midnight showing and getting three hours of sleep before going to school..totally worth it
"Oct 01, 2012",4.5,it was really good it went well with all the other movies I have this one at home
"Sep 30, 2012",5,Best Star Wars Ever.

"Sep 30, 2012",3,better than the first two... but the original were better...
"Sep 30, 2012",5,"Loved every moment of this film fron the opening to the ending, not nerly as good as empire,fellowship, or serenity but damn close."
"Sep 29, 2012",4.5,"Easily the best of the Star Wars prequels, RotS has iffy dialogue, but a great storyline that succeeds in tying together the saga, as well as incredible special effects."
"Sep 29, 2012",3.5,it was good for star wars
"Sep 29, 2012",4,An excellent finale to the star wars series with superb acting and phastasmagorical lightsabre duels and action sequences... Unfortunately to be potentially ruined by George Lucas' self admitted shockingly poor ability to write love scenes.
"Sep 29, 2012",4,Much better for the prequels installment and a satisfying end to the Star Wars saga (until the animated film later destroyed the whole thing again)
"Sep 28, 2012",5,"so clean and it was alot of action in it ,thats what i like"

"Sep 27, 2012",2.5,"Star Wars rules, but the new ones..meh."
"Sep 27, 2012",3.5,"Considering how terrible Episodes I and II were, I was fairly impressed with this one.  I waited a while to see it in theatres, expecting it to be God-awful, but my friends and I were all pleasantly surprised.  Sure, the love scenes were horrendous and there were a few huge plot holes and inconsistencies to the original trilogy, (and who can forget Vader's infamous ""NOOOOO!""), but overall, it wasn't bad.  The fight scenes were fantastic, the blending of prequel and original trilogy soundtracks was enough to make even the most stubborn fanboy cream his pants, and the whole ""You were my brother, Anakin!"" speech in the Mustafar scene never fails to get me a bit misty.  Go Ewan McGregor!"
"Sep 27, 2012",4,My favorite star wars movie of the prequels.
"Sep 27, 2012",5,Best of the 6 films. Enough said!
"Sep 27, 2012",2,"Just like it's predecessors, it really suffers from boringly shot dialogue scenes and questionable character motivation. The action scenes are satisfying, but it still doesn't grasp the sense of wonder of the original trilogy. Ok at best."
"Sep 26, 2012",3,"The best of the prequels, but that's not saying much at all."
"Sep 26, 2012",3,Lucas should have stopped with Jedi if the new triology was the best he could do.
"Sep 26, 2012",3.5,Best of the prequals.
"Sep 26, 2012",2.5,Not my favorite but still good
"Sep 26, 2012",3,"entertaining,  but makes absolutely zero sense if u think about it."
"Sep 26, 2012",4,"Easily the best of the prequels - Anakin's gradual fall to the Dark Side is good to see, regardless of the flaw that it is Hayden Christensen doing the acting, any scene with Padme in it is boring and unneccesary, otherwise lots of good music and good CGI fights. That's all I want from my Star Wars prequels."
"Sep 25, 2012",3,All star wars movies are good.
"Sep 25, 2012",5,"Oh well, Star Wars... Masterpiece, even though first 3 episodes are clearly from a different era."
"Sep 25, 2012",4.5,"One of my favorite Star Wars films and the best of the prequel trilogy. For me, this was the Star Wars movie that got me into the franchise before I watched the original trilogy and after this film ended, it left me curious to what would happen next in the franchise's story. After the duds that were the first two prequels, George Lucas finally steps it up a notch and directs a much better well rounded movie. The acting is much better, the visual effects still hold up, there is actually an interesting story here, and the stakes are raised much higher here. I honestly think Hayden Christensen does great in this film and he improves upon Attack of the Clones, he does really good here at portraying anger and sadness. It is chilling to watch his turn to the dark side. I think too many people criticize him here and he wasn't the terrible actor here that he was in Attack of the Clones. Ewan McGregor actually plays Obi-Wan Kenobi very well here and much better than he did in Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. The visual effects here are the best Star Wars prequel trilogy has ever seen and they succeed at giving us really great action scenes and beautiful landscape shots. This is one of the darkest Star Wars films and there are really great emotional moments here that work, are acted well, and actually succeed at being memorable. John William's score really elevates this film to a higher level and his music makes all the great parts more awesome to watch. My only major gripe with the movie that keeps it from reaching the high levels of the original trilogy is during the first act. You get quite a few cheesy lines of dialogue and that was one of the major flaws with the last two prequels. But after the first act and during the second and third half of the film the cheesy lines finally stop and the story and action becomes more evolving and interesting. This was the prequel all hardcore Star Wars fans were waiting for and with this one it is like George Lucas actually cared here and put hard effort because it payed off and this movie does not disappoint like the other prequels did."
"Sep 25, 2012",1,noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
"Sep 24, 2012",3,pretty good...i guess
"Sep 24, 2012",5,One of my most quoted and loved movies. I am surprised it's audience ratings aren't higher with the amount of people I know who enjoy this film.
"Sep 24, 2012",5,Seen it. Pretty sweet movie
"Sep 23, 2012",3,No doubt the best in the new trilogy. Still manages to be basically nothing in comparison to anyyyyy of the originals.
"Sep 23, 2012",4,"Despite some poor character development with Anakin and feels mindless at times, Star Wars: Episode III still feels epic and satisfying."
"Sep 23, 2012",2,"The sixth and final film in the Star Wars saga is tasked with the daunting job of tying the two prequels with the original trilogy, and that is where it fails. The film follows the final days of the jedi and Anakin and Obi Wan's friendship as we see tue transformation from Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader. Visually, the film impresses, though I do miss the days when director George Lucas used actual sets instead of relying heavily on Industrial Light and Magic to do all the work. The acting is good from most, but Natalie Portman is still weak, and Hayden Christensen remains as wooden and lifeless as we was in the previous film. The action is top notch as usual, remaining the highlight of the film. Now for the big issue: continuity. The biggest offense is the birth of the twins, followed by the immediate death of Padme. In the sixth film, Leia tells Luke that remembers little about her mother, for she died when Leia was a small child. Another offense, though one made solely in the third film with no connection, is when Yoda tells Obi-Wan that he is able to contact the dead, meaning Qui-gon. That makes no sense because that is never touched on again in the later films. George Lucas should have stopped with the original trilogy, but for some reason he pressed on with three more that only tarnished the saga."
"Sep 23, 2012",3,"As far as sci-fi movies go, it was a good one. Id probably like it better if i was a guy, though."
"Sep 23, 2012",5,Absolutelly amazing.  The best of all 6 and very sad too :[
"Sep 23, 2012",3.5,Much better than the previous two. It has an actual story to accompany impressive action scenes. Doesn't quite reach even the low point of the original trilogy (Return of the Jedi) but it's close enough to still be considered in the same league.
"Sep 22, 2012",4,"If this does stand out as the final live action Star Wars film, then what an excellent way to go out."
"Sep 22, 2012",5,great movie in the triligy
"Sep 22, 2012",1,"Gross letdown... Hey Lucas, you jumped the shark"

RENT"
"Sep 20, 2012",5,best star wasrs movie
"Sep 20, 2012",3,the only new Star Wars to be even close to passable.
"Sep 19, 2012",4,The only prequel film to be able say it has bad moments in a good film. Revenge of the Sith succeeds thanks to exciting action and a health dose of emotion steeped in mythology.
"Sep 18, 2012",3,"Cool special effects, horrible acting, But it's star wars"
"Sep 18, 2012",1,Not the Jedi film i was looking for!
"Sep 17, 2012",2.5,I don't really like the new Star Wars movies . . . The old ones are classic . . .
"Sep 17, 2012",1.5,"In my review of Attack of the Clones, I said how Revenge of the Sith has become ""accepted (albeit grudgingly)"" into the inner circle of the Star Wars canon. It's widely held to be the best of the prequels, and even its opponents will concede that it is in some way narratively necessary, in order to tie up the origin of Darth Vader. His character development (if that term is appropriate for the prequels) is the only reason besides the money that we are saddled with this trilogy.

For once, I am in agreement, both as a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy and an opponent of the other prequels. Revenge of the Sith is better than Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, having a marginally stronger story and being altogether more watchable. But whether you compare it to the originals or its sci-fi contemporaries, it is still a pretty bad film. Its few virtues are magnified only by the lowering of expectations after the first two instalments, and a feeling of relief that it is finally all over (or, chronologically, that we have finally reached the good part).

The most noticeable change in Revenge of the Sith is the overriding feeling we get from watching it. The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones both produced feelings of depression and seething rage, while this film is a little easier to sit through. The question which we have to keep asking ourselves is this: it is genuinely better, or is it that we have grown to expect so little from these films that none of George Lucas' ineptitude shocks us anymore? Have we become like hard-core Highlander fans, who turn up wearily for each new film on the basis that, no matter how bad it is, it can't be worse than Highlander 2: The Quickening?

To be fair to Lucas (God knows I've been trying), there are certain things about Revenge of the Sith which are clear improvements. There is a lot less of the horribly written romance that sank Attack of the Clones, with Padmé's screen time being used relatively wisely. With the exception of the closing montage, there is no deliberate attempt to justify the film on the basis of its continuity with the originals. And best of all, Jar Jar Binks is barely in it.

The big narrative advantage with Revenge of the Sith is that, unlike the other prequels, we have some idea of where it is going. While Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones blindsided us with their creative choices, and wore us down with their water-treading story-telling, we can sit through the third film knowing that, at some point, Anakin will go to the dark side. While this does mean the transition comes as no surprise, we always knew this was what the prequels were building up to, and therefore we can forgive a little predictability.

But even here Lucas finds a way to screw things up. In order for Anakin's transition to be dramatically compelling, we have to believe that he is a genuinely well-meaning, good person who is, to quote his master, ""seduced by the dark side of the Force"". But all throughout the prequels, Anakin has been built up as being deeply frustrated with his master and the Jedi as a whole. He's constantly sulking at not getting his way, so that his transition becomes so inevitable that there isn't any drama to it at all. No matter how impressively he is mutilated, we're just bored by him.

Not only is Anakin's transformation far too willing, but it's built up as being far more complex than it actually is. Lucas is trying to position his story as being like a Shakespearean tragedy or one of the darker episodes of I, Claudius, in which characters descend into darkness through deep-seated jealousy, paranoia, pride or spite. But he has neither the emotional intelligence to make Anakin's fear for Padmé believable, nor the political insight to make the realpolitik make sense. As with so much in the prequels, what we are told is deep, insightful and engaging as actually boring, infantile and devoid of any creativity.

Both of these issues with the central plot point reflect the fact that Revenge of the Sith, like its predecessors, doesn't know who its core audience is. The film made headlines for being the first Star Wars film to be given a 12 certificate, with Lucas promising that this would be 'the dark one'. The storyline and spectacle is too childish and directionless for anyone old enough to see the film in a cinema, but Anakin's incineration is too graphic for anyone younger than 8. Lucas has once again betrayed the spirit of the originals, which were given U or PG certificates because they were suitable and appealing for people of all ages.

I've resisted diving into too much plot analysis in my previous Star Wars reviews, since there are so many holes in each of the prequels that my reviews would quickly turn into lists. But since Revenge of the Sith is concerned with getting us to Darth Vader, and thereby tying things up with Episode IV, it's only fair to address how utterly nonsensical the story is. The story of Revenge of the Sith makes next to no sense whether you're a fan or a casual viewer - though it's hard to see how any casual viewer with half a brain would have made it this far.

Put simply, Revenge of the Sith makes all the people we are supposed to like look like complete idiots. Palpatine's plot has been obvious to us from the get-go, and yet it's only after Anakin kills the younglings that Obi-Wan realises that something is amiss. The latter's trip to hunt down General Grievous (another pointless character) is total filler, designed only to give Anakin and Palpatine some quality time. And the whole Order 66 malarkey just screams of plot contrivance, further reflecting Lucas' lack of understanding about how dictatorships gradually erode and replace democracies.

On top of all that, the film screws up the continuity with the original trilogy. In The Empire Strikes Back, Vader is told by the Emperor about ""the son of Skywalker"" - and he just accepts it, as if he always knew it to be true. But in this film, he is convinced by the Emperor that Padmé was killed and therefore he cannot have a son. If we assume that Sith is canon (we have no reason not to), it doesn't make sense that Vader would react so calmly to this revelation, let alone wait until the end of the following film to confront the Emperor about it.

One part of the film which Star Wars fans have defended is the lightsaber battles, particularly the confrontation between Obi-Wan and Anakin on Mustafar. But all the battle sequences, lightsaber-based or otherwise, look and feel like badly-designed video games. The opening battle with the infiltration of Grievous' ship feels like the opening of a third-person shooter, and the lightsaber fights are directed by someone who understands neither the laws of physics nor the drama of spontaneity. In any case these battles are so badly edited that we don't particularly care who comes out on top.

The performances in Revenge of the Sith are terrible because they convey the exact opposite of what they intended. Hayden Christiansen tries to be moody and threatening, but his half-hearted scream of ""I hate you!"" sound less like a man on fire than a boy who was told that he couldn't have an ice-cream. Ewan McGregor tries to convey gravitas and regret, but he just looks out of his depth and his recklessness is totally out of character. Natalie Portman tries to show Padmé's heartbreak at losing Anakin, and yet she delivers the line ""you're breaking my heart"" like a cheerleader stood up at the prom. The only good performance comes from Ian McDiarmid, who plays Palpatine as an old-fashioned, Hammer horror bad guy. He seems to be the only one having fun, perhaps because he's the only one who understands how silly it all is.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is by far the best of the prequels, but is still a very poorly made mess of a film. Even if we disregard the on-going feelings of betrayal and issues regarding continuity, it is still badly written, badly directed and poorly acted outside of McDiarmid hamming it up. The few saving graces are not enough either to redeem the film in its own right or to provide any justification for what has gone before. It's a depressing and empty conclusion to a depressing and empty trilogy, and the most we can feel after seeing it is relief that it's finally over."
"Sep 17, 2012",1,"Its only saving grace is its title.
No story has ever had a less convincing fall to ""the dark side"" than this."
"Sep 17, 2012",2.5,"Revenge of the Sith is impeccably designed and has very intense action sequences, but this film only stands on that, and the affection people have for the series. The dramatical direction is weak and the lead performance by Christensen doesn't seem plausible. A film were Lucas never achieves to make honor to the great source material he possessed for this final chapter."
"Sep 16, 2012",3,"nice job on the effects, but i think george tried to hard"
"Sep 16, 2012",4.5,this was awesome i love the fighting and the hot guys r a bonus
"Sep 16, 2012",5,of course youd know i love this movie
"Sep 16, 2012",3.5,An all-star cast and iconic characters didn't hold this story together very well. Several significant plot holes and an over abundance of digital effects left this picture rather flat in my opinion. The weakest entry in the saga.
"Sep 16, 2012",5,grew up on star wars
"Sep 16, 2012",3.5,The best one of the three new films. I rate films out of 4 stars. (3.5/4)
"Sep 15, 2012",2,"My Review: 4/10
Date: 7/6/2013
Wow, this has not aged well.  The dialogue is terrible and stilted (hold me like you did by the lake on Naboo).  With lots of good actors, how is the acting this bad.  The plot has tons of holes and head-scratchers.  Makes me leery of any new Star Wars additions.

My Review: 8/10
Date: 5/21/2005
This is the best of the prequels, but is still not up to par for the originals. It ties up questions nicely and has lots of cool action scenes. Although it does bring up the question - if they can rebuild people like Vader, why can't they save someone from dying during childbirth? Also why didn't Obi Wan put Ani out of his misery and let him live?"

"Sep 10, 2012",2,"Lo mejor de esta pelicula es que acaba con el tormento de todos los fans de Star Wars, la pesadilla termina y podemos vivir nuestras vidas tranquilos."
"Sep 09, 2012",4,"Yep, it's good. A lot of questions are answered here, plus you get to see how certain characters became what they were back in 1977 when Episode IV was released. The element surprise practically doesn't exist on Revenge of the Sith, and that makes the film sort of forgetable... nontheless enjoyable to watch. Biggest problem (for me) about this episode is that sometimes it's very childish. It can be serious when it has too, but the comic relief is just too much for a Star Wars movie. I still prefer the first (last) three, and no one will convince me otherwise."
"Sep 09, 2012",4,Dont really remember it but i like star wars

"Sep 08, 2012",2.5,not so good as previous episode
"Sep 08, 2012",2.5,Great special effects and action sequences don't make up for the laughable performances in the final installment of the Star Wars saga.
"Sep 08, 2012",3,i like these type of films
"Sep 07, 2012",4,"After being bombarded with two disappointing prequels, this is the one people were hoping wouldn't suck. For some people, they found themselves disappointed again. For me, however, I can say that I actually really like this movie, aside from its occasional stupidity. This movie has a significant improvement in its acting, writing, and visual effects. The story is engaging, the action is great, and there is an emotional core that was severely lacking in the previous two. There is still terrible romantic dialogue here and there, but not enough to make it unwatchable. Hayden Christensen is still bad, but not nearly as bad as he was in AotC. Portman stays bad as well. McGregor and Oz both shine as the bright spots of acting, alongside Ian McDiarmid completely owning it as Palpatine. There are many things in this movie that don't work, such as the abrupt turn of Anakin to Darth Vader, and Padme dying of a...broken heart...ughh. However, the good outweighs the bad this time. The opening action sequence is phenomenal, the movie is fast paced, and once it kicks in to it's second half, it doesn't let up. The lightsaber fights are great, aside from Palpatine vs Mace Windu. The Grievous fight is great, and the final battle between Anakin vs Obi-Wan and Yoda vs Palpatine are all fantastic. There are actual moments of emotion, such as the phenomenal Ruminations scene and the Order 66 massacre. This movie is the only prequel to actually make me care. While there was certainly a missed opportunity with the prequels and Darth Vader, Revenge told its story pretty well. The score might also be my favorite score of the franchise. The ending is intense and closes the franchise in a fantastic way, in my opinion. Overall, I feel Revenge of the Sith gets too much hate. It is nowhere near as bad as Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, and actually holds its own. It is a good way to lead up into the original trilogy, and while the acting still sucks and not everything was handled perfectly, I cant help but enjoy it. 8/10"

"Sep 01, 2012",3,wanna see it cuz the dude who plays the bad dude was so damn funny with the making of the movie.
"Sep 01, 2012",4,The best movie out of the 3 prequels is definitely Episode III
"Sep 01, 2012",2,"Ew, I don't like star wars. I think it's stupid. I would never go see it."
"Sep 01, 2012",5,star wars is a classic and a must see
"Sep 01, 2012",3.5,"Decent, best of the prequels, not saying much. The actor who plays Anakin is horrid."
"Sep 01, 2012",4,If you've seen one star wars you've seen them all. I don't really get the hype. I enjoyed them all but they're all kinda the same. No offense if you're a die hard star wars fan.
"Aug 31, 2012",5,Wow did not grow up with star wars but man this trilogy is one of the best
"Aug 31, 2012",2,Needed more explanation.
"Aug 31, 2012",5,"Update- just watched it on Bluray and absolutely loved it again. The story is truly a classic and extremely epic. 5/5


For some strange reason I'm watching this movie for the first time since it was released 7 years ago. I absolutely love it and definitely my favorite star wars movie. The two battles at the end of the film were epic, damn it was soooo good."
"Aug 31, 2012",5,The best Star Wars movie!
"Aug 31, 2012",1.5,i liked the originals
"Aug 31, 2012",3.5,Lucas made the movies we've been waiting decades for. Second trilogy lacks story and too many effects.  But it's Star Wars.
"Aug 31, 2012",2.5,"This was the best of the prequels, which collectively are the biggest disappointments movie-wise I have ever experienced to date."
"Aug 31, 2012",3,"The final three were disappointments, especially compared to the first three"
"Aug 30, 2012",3.5,If you do not see the ealier then you will not be able to follow.
"Aug 30, 2012",3.5,"This is the best of the prequels, but that doesn't say much."
"Aug 30, 2012",4.5,BRILLIANT FILM AND A GOOD ENDING TO A GREAT PREQUEL
"Aug 29, 2012",4.5,Japanese Title: Suta wozu episodo 3 - Shisu no fukushu
"Aug 29, 2012",3,"I made real fans mad, lauging at all the cheesy lines!"
"Aug 29, 2012",2,Not really a big Star Wars fan.
"Aug 28, 2012",4.5,I LOOKED @ IT A LOT LOVED IT
"Aug 28, 2012",5,biggest star wars fan
"Aug 28, 2012",4.5,This third movie in the 2nd trilogy finally regains the splendor and grandiose feeling of the first trilogy. I guess better late than never as the saying goes.
"Aug 27, 2012",3,"much better than the first two, an even with all its problem the resolution alone is worth it."
"Aug 27, 2012",3,"An epic, exhilarating, and visually stunning conclusion to the prequel trilogy."
"Aug 27, 2012",4,Heavy revelation in this film also as we watch Anakin totally cross over to the dark side.  Spectacular lightsaber battles as well.
"Aug 27, 2012",4.5,"A magnificent lead-in to the original trilogy, despite the still less-than-great acting. The lightsaber fights are incredible and give this review at least an extra half-star. Ewan, as always, is the standout in this film and while Hayden is a passable Anakin, he really seems to enjoy playing Vader and he does a great job as the much darker Skywalker persona. Not near the quality of the final three chapters of the story, but still very good and packs a whole lot into one movie, yet not feeling forced."
"Aug 27, 2012",5,The best star wars Prequel
"Aug 26, 2012",4.5,I was pretty impressed.
"Aug 26, 2012",3.5,The original three were so much better!
"Aug 26, 2012",5,who doesn't love star wars?
"Aug 26, 2012",4,"Almost answered every question you had, however left you wanting more"
"Aug 26, 2012",2,"A disappointment, I think."
"Aug 25, 2012",5,"one of the best movies ever, period."
"Aug 25, 2012",4,Anakin finally gone bad.
"Aug 25, 2012",5,Im a big dedicated fan of the Star Wars Series so This movie didnt dissapoint
"Aug 25, 2012",1.5,"1.5 stars is VERY generous. The special effects and musical scores were good, but that's all it had going for it."
"Aug 25, 2012",3.5,"It could have been so much more... but we were left with a drag with 10 good minutes of interesting character development. The rest is just false. I recommend you go read the novel instead, the story is just better developed there."
"Aug 24, 2012",2.5,Could have been better...
"Aug 23, 2012",4,The only good Star Wars Prequel. Shows the rise of the most famous villain in American Film History
"Aug 23, 2012",4.5,"The only movie I ever saw that I knew the ending for, but still wanted to see and did not regret it one bit, a Must See (Again, and Again..........)"
"Aug 23, 2012",2,Can't compare with the originals.
"Aug 23, 2012",5,"i really like this movie

why did hayden christensen have to turn evil i really like him"
"Aug 22, 2012",5,w t f...who doesn't like star wars?
"Aug 21, 2012",4,"better than the 1st 2, but left to many details left unresolved from the 1st trilogies"
"Aug 21, 2012",3,Don't really care for
"Aug 21, 2012",4,"The final chapter in the infamous Star Wars saga is probably the best finale of any franchise. Featuring a superb balance between drama and action, unlike the other prequels. This finishing episode finally answers many questions that were still unanswered by the episodes before. To me, although this will never top any of the original trilogy, it is the best out of the prequels and might just be as appreciated as Episodes VI, V and IV."
"Aug 21, 2012",5,The best Star Wars film features remarkable special effects and an incredible performance from McGregor.
"Aug 20, 2012",4,"Great action? Yes. Terrible Acting? Yes. It's funny, after those first two horrible Star Wars movies, Lucas made this and it was pretty good. But then after it's finished he goes and destroys the franchise further with that ridiculous cartoon series. All in all, Grade: B-"
"Aug 20, 2012",4.5,"saw it , it was ok .not something i would own thou"
"Aug 20, 2012",5,come to the dark side
"Aug 20, 2012",4,now Star Wars?? you cant miss that
"Aug 20, 2012",3.5,not as good as i thought it was gonna be
"Aug 19, 2012",4.5,"It's like Lucas had two strikes with the first two prequels, and got a home run with this movie."
"Aug 19, 2012",4,"I know that she died, but still depressing"
"Aug 19, 2012",5,love all the movies.
"Aug 19, 2012",2.5,"The older ones were a lot better obviously, but I halve to say this film was very well done and a great way to to end the final movie in the star wars saga."
"Aug 19, 2012",5,my favorite star wars movie
"Aug 19, 2012",4,This just depresses me
"Aug 19, 2012",3.5,"great action and effect 
lacking actors"
"Aug 18, 2012",4,Jar jar you doomed us all ...
"Aug 18, 2012",3,only because anachin is a hottie
"Aug 18, 2012",5,Action-packed and a epic conclusion to an epic franchise give me a light saber it's time to fight back!!!
"Aug 17, 2012",4,"Seen it.  Best of the 3 newer films.
But 2 1/2 hours and it still seems like it was rushed."
"Aug 17, 2012",4,i am a starwars fan and proud of it
"Aug 16, 2012",3,"A decent ending to a painfully cheesy and self destructive trilogy. It's only redeeming factor is Vader's beautiful black visage at the end. Oh yea, and Natalie Portman dies of a broken heart. A BROKEN HEART. It's The Notebook on steroids."
"Aug 16, 2012",4,"Johnny thinks it should have  six stars.
I thought it was cool."
"Aug 16, 2012",3,"Great story but a bit distracting at times with bad acting on various scenes.  The Darth Vader's Frankenstein ""Noooo!"" scene was difficult for me to stay seriously invested in the story."
"Aug 16, 2012",4,finally what we all wanted to see..
"Aug 16, 2012",2,"Visual masturbation with atrocious writing, schizophrenic tone and a weak plot."
"Aug 16, 2012",4,i love all the star wars movies...  so good.
"Aug 16, 2012",4,i can't stop watching it.
"Aug 15, 2012",3,Great action but terrible dialogue and SO MANY inconsistencies with the originals. Also the turn to the dark side was lame. See the redlettermedia reviews to be convinced that this movie and the other two prequels truly SUCK. The reviews are really funny too.
"Aug 15, 2012",3,i watched the star wars movies for natalie portman
"Aug 15, 2012",3.5,OOH!! great graphics
"Aug 14, 2012",4.5,"Easily the best of the prequel trilogy. While Hayden Christensen sucks normally as an actor, he is saved because he is supposed to be cold and lifeless. This saves the prequel trilogy from being a complete failure."
"Aug 14, 2012",5,Want to spend a vacation watching the whole series
"Aug 14, 2012",3.5,some cool cinematography; but I didn't feel the love between Anakin &amp; Padme; or the pain of childbirth either!
"Aug 14, 2012",3,The one Star Wars prequel that I can actually tolerate.
"Aug 14, 2012",2.5,"While this may be the best of the prequels, that still ain't saying much.  The writing is poor and the acting wooden (save Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson).  For Lucas, technology seems to no longer be a means to tell a story--it seems to BE the story."
"Aug 14, 2012",5,"this was an excellent movie, it was my favorite movie out of all of them."
"Aug 14, 2012",2,"Best of the prequels is still a far cry from the originals. Chancellor Palpatine executes the final stage of his plot (and the Jedi Order) overthrowing the Republic and turning Anakin Skywalker to the Dark Side. All the elements that made the first two films unbearable are present, but the story actually makes sense and the characters are one and a half dimensional."
"Aug 14, 2012",5,Best of the prequels
"Aug 12, 2012",1.5,never really watched it.
"Aug 12, 2012",3,hott guy gets almost killed therefore ruining the movie
"Aug 12, 2012",4.5,coolio in the dillio movie
"Aug 12, 2012",0.5,I dislike this kind of movies
"Aug 12, 2012",3,not a huge starwars fan
"Aug 12, 2012",4.5,This is the better of the newer ones
"Aug 12, 2012",4.5,I don't care I liked it.
"Aug 12, 2012",3.5,don't like it as much as 2nd star wars
"Aug 11, 2012",2.5,"This is the best the prequels have to offer, which still isn't saying all that much.  This film is dark, but not in The Empire Strikes Back kind of way.  It's much more mean-spirited and violent.  These are elements that do not sit well in a Star Wars film.  The lightsaber battles are very impressive, much more so than what we've seen so far, but it doesn't atone for the horrendous cardboard acting or the insistence on giving Tatooine a third moon.  Depicting Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader further contributes to the ruination of the character's mythology, and no matter how hard George Lucas tries to connect the ending to the original trilogy, it just won't work.  Its action sequences and special effects make it an average movie-going experience, but I am still desperately clinging to the hope that episode VII and beyond will never get made."
"Aug 11, 2012",4,"The best of the prequels, by far. Though it doesn't quite reach the adventurous fun of the originals, it definitely is a worthy entry in the Star Wars saga. Some bland acting and some unintentionally funny scenes do hurt it quite a bit at times, but this is still a very entertaining film."
"Aug 11, 2012",5,"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, film of 2005 and once again directed by George Lucas. the sixth and final Star Wars film released and the third in terms of chronology. the film is rescue Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), the successful rescue by the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and the Padawan Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) arrive on the planet Courscant where there Anakin discovers that his beloved Padme (Natalie Portman) is pregnant. Because Anakin's friendship with Chancellor Palpatine the Jedi Council fears that the Chancellor trame something and thinking Anakin that the Jedi Council is not confident enough in him, Palpatine reveals himself as Darth Sidius. and this lures Anakin to the dark side after having visions of his beloved Padme dying giving birth .. the transfer of Anakin to the dark side starts great battles against the will of life of the Jedi and the Sith seek to govern in peace galaxy and the Republic is replaced by the galactic Empire.

the film is the darkest of the new trilogy, has an interesting history but also features over-use of special effects as in the above 2. While development has made â&lt;â&lt;visual undertones really dark and intriguing to see what makes the spirit of seriousness of Star Wars nots."
"Aug 11, 2012",4,very good it will stand the test of time
"Aug 10, 2012",4.5,Very entertaining si-fi!
"Aug 09, 2012",2.5,i thought it was gonna b better
"Aug 09, 2012",3.5,"Contains the best duels in the entire saga. Too bad continuity wasn't there for the later episodes. Dialogue was laughable, as evidenced by those sitting around me."
"Aug 08, 2012",5,tap into the dark side
"Aug 08, 2012",1,i was hoping for more...
"Aug 08, 2012",0.5,that one dude is hot
"Aug 08, 2012",2.5,"The best of the prequels, but still mediocre."
"Aug 07, 2012",3,"Not my favorite of the six movies by far!Great FX, but the battle scene at the end between Anakin and Obi-Wan really pushed my willing suspension of disbelief...even for a sci-fi movie!"
"Aug 07, 2012",4.5,"very good, lots of action, but of course i am a star wars nerd."
"Aug 07, 2012",3,buena continuacion a una saga excelente que posiblemente perdure
"Aug 06, 2012",3,"The final end to a lagacy that should have stopped long long ago in a galaxy far far away. Horrible acting over done crappy computer graphics, carried by the Originals But what can I say I love STAR WARS"
"Aug 06, 2012",4,As a Star Wars kid I loved it!...
"Aug 06, 2012",3.5,Best out of the first three episodes.  Acting was horrible but the look and feel of this movie is uber-clean and beautiful.
"Aug 06, 2012",4,By no means a bad film but still a disappointment to the original three...
"Aug 06, 2012",3.5,Well it's the best of the prequels...
"Aug 06, 2012",3,The last battle between Obi Wan &amp; Anakin was awesome...other than that I wasn't too impressed
"Aug 05, 2012",2,"The best of the prequels, which is still pretty terrible.  None of the major characters were likable, which compelled me to root for the Sith.  Padme and her insipid moralizing sets the feminist movement back by at least three decades."
"Aug 05, 2012",2.5,"It's fine, the better of the three, but still pretty bad."
"Aug 05, 2012",3,"This third entry of the trilogy was the best of the three, so good that it celebrates achieving an average status."
"Aug 05, 2012",5,"This was the perfect way to end the series.  It answered every question, but left you wanting 7-9 and -2-0.  I even cried."
"Aug 05, 2012",4,Underrated and better than at least 3 others in the series.
"Aug 04, 2012",2,Dark side? Revenge? George Lucas? Smells like a big pile of SITH to me.
"Aug 04, 2012",4,"Even though the first 2 prequels weren't as strong as the original trilogy, Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith will please and excite Star Wars fans and people alike, as the final part of the prequel trilogy comes full circle, thanks to an exciting idea, story and script, a wonderful cast headed by Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala and Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, beautiful locations, wonderful cinematography, and plenty of exciting action sequences, fights and stunts that any Star Wars diehard fan won't wanna miss and will enjoy again and again."
"Aug 04, 2012",5,Best movie...ever...
"Aug 04, 2012",5,"Never wanted 2 become a Star Wars geek, but this is a damn good movie.   Now where the hell is The Matrix?!"
"Aug 04, 2012",4,never like star wars i only watch then if nothing else is on
"Aug 03, 2012",4.5,The best of the three star wars prequels.
"Aug 03, 2012",3.5,"Although the acting is laughable, it's still a great movie."
"Aug 03, 2012",5,"Yooz thuh paower uvv thuh foarse, behbeh! XD I saw this movie with my older sis. :)"
"Aug 03, 2012",4,"Tediously long, and the worst written dialogue I have ever had the luckless fate to suffer. This final chapter in the sequels of prequels was only saved by its exceptional fight scenes, and even they went on far too long. It was style over substance, and with even WORSE acting than the last, Episode III barely scraped by to end the triloy of prequels and yet another shameful toy-commercial story to what was once the most classically loved Fantasy series in history. Turn off your brain, and ignore the ""Noooooooooooooooo!"" and you might just tolerate it long enough to get to the credits. For sheer battle enjoyment and light-saber fights, give it another star on the score if you are a fanboy... like me. :-)"
"Aug 02, 2012",3,Of the three new star wars movies this one was the best. Unfortunately the first one was so bad that I rated it 1/2.
"Aug 02, 2012",5,"I am speechless. It is the absolute BEST MOVIE EVER...other than all the other Star Wars films...
""There's still good in him. I know...there's still..."" - PadmÃ (C) Amidala"
"Aug 02, 2012",3.5,"Despite the first two poor installments to this otherwise unnecessary prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith manages to succeed by it's epic montage of the fall of the Jedi and the tragic fate of Anakin Skywalker."
"Aug 02, 2012",5,awsome film should have been nominated for the oscar for best picture and best supporting actor for Hayden
"Aug 02, 2012",5,"Even fans who hated Episodes I and II will grudgingly admit that the final film in the new trilogy has elements of greatness in there. And the truth about Episode III is that it is the strongest of the prequels as well as my third favourite in the series. As much as I loved Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, I could sort of tell that Lucas was getting warmed up when making those two films and this is where he finally delivered a finale that sets up the original trilogy in the best way possible. Every single actor in this film is better than before. Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen give emotionally charged performances along with Ian McDiarmid delivering his trademark cackle as Palpatine, delivering one of the best movie villains in sci-fi cinema. The visuals in this film are utterly gorgeous and look like old Romantic paintings. Lucas is a master at feeding beautiful visuals onto the screen and telling a rich story even if his dialogue is cliched and flat - which to most Star Wars fans like me, is part of the magic. The relationships between the characters are richly invested and the ending to Sith remains one of my personal favourite finales to any movie. Even the controversial romance between Anakin and Natalie Portman as Padme has been improved significantly and feels more compelling and tragic. This and the other two prequels are severely mistreated and underrated and deserve to be mentioned as some of the greatest sci-fi films ever made."
"Aug 02, 2012",5,am a Star Wars junkie
"Aug 02, 2012",3,never been much  of a fan of star wars
"Aug 01, 2012",5,The Star Wars saga is now complete.... The end of the Clone Wars.... The death of the Jedi Order.... The Revenge of the Sith.... The fall of Anakin Skywalker.... The Coming of Darth Vader.... It's all here.... Watch it....
"Aug 01, 2012",4,It was a good ending to the saga.
"Aug 01, 2012",5,my favorite star wars movie
"Aug 01, 2012",4,it's good but not great
"Jul 31, 2012",5,was really good and nice conclusion before heading to new hope
"Jul 31, 2012",1,"I like the older ones! (arent' the older ones 4,5,and 6?)"
"Jul 31, 2012",3,Definitely better than the first two prequels. But still doesn't come close to the original trilogy.
"Jul 31, 2012",5,The opening scene of this movie is one of the craziest things I've ever seen.
"Jul 31, 2012",3.5,This one is the best in my opinion...enjoyed watching it
"Jul 31, 2012",3.5,not as good as the original
"Jul 30, 2012",1.5,"never did se the whole thing, not a real big fan of star wars"
"Jul 30, 2012",4,A pretty good Star Wars movie that looks like a masterpiece when compared to the past two despite a poor performance from Hayden Christensen
"Jul 28, 2012",2,"Of the three ""new ones"" this is the best. 

It's still contrived crap that doesn't add anything to the universe of the originals; but at least it doesn't make you think a trip to the dentist would be more enjoyable."
"Jul 28, 2012",5,"Really great,a great way to end the saga."
"Jul 27, 2012",4,"By far the best film of the new trilogy, the non-stop action and development of the Clone Wars is commendable. What isn't is the continued appalling performances from Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman, who drag this film from great to mediocre."
"Jul 27, 2012",2.5,"Half a star is just for the title (the best thing about it).

"Jul 27, 2012",4,All Star Wars are good.
"Jul 26, 2012",4,not as good as the originals but it was really good
"Jul 26, 2012",4,"kinda dope, but i felt it lacked something."
"Jul 25, 2012",5,I got two words for you DARTH VADAR
"Jul 25, 2012",2,"I would say that the Star Wars prequels are an absolute abomination, but it has already been said many times. Like many SW fans who grew up in the 80's, I really tried to tell myself that I liked these movies. That is until I realized that I don't want to live a lie. I can't get over such terrible dialogue like ""Anakin, you're breaking my heart"" or ""It's over Anakin. I have the high ground"". Despite this movie being a step up from ""Phantom Menace"" with some great lightsaber fights, these prequels make me want to jump into the Sarlacc pit, voluntarily.

P.S. - You can't have Darth Vader yell, ""NOOOOO!"" in the same tone as Eric Cartman &amp; not laugh."
"Jul 25, 2012",3,good closure but lame in general
"Jul 25, 2012",3,"It's the best out of Episodes I-III- but that's not saying much. There's a lot more going on here action-wise, but Christensen's acting is still atrocious, making his descent into Darth Vader not as believable or emotionally impacting as I would have hoped."
"Jul 25, 2012",4,they need to make more Star Wars movies
"Jul 24, 2012",4.5,"After two disappointing Star Wars prequels, Revenge of the Sith is dark, well written, digitally fantastic, and emotional. But every actor has seemed to improve EXCEPT for Hayden Christensen."
"Jul 24, 2012",3.5,Did not live up to the hype but still interesting enough.
"Jul 24, 2012",4.5,"After I watched this, I was depressed for days"
"Jul 24, 2012",4,"Revenge of the Sith still again has clunky dialogue and it has way too much story and highly important story at that. I do not understand why George Lucas stuffed all of this greatness into one film and left the first two films ultimately pointless and unnecessary in the bigger scope of things. But there is no denying how powerful this film is and how emotionally rewarding that third act is. Its story is important, grandiose and so well realized and the highlights include all of the scenes between Palpatine and Anakin, the ending, the Yoda-Darth Sidius duel and of course the duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan which is not only cool, but also very tragic. It is the most fun and rewatchable Star Wars film of them all and easily the best of the prequel trilogy."
"Jul 24, 2012",4,Pretty Good for a newer Star Wars Movie.  Old ones are still better.
"Jul 23, 2012",2,"After ""Attack of the Clones"", audiences were skeptical about the conclusion of the prequel trilogy, but when the film was released the word of mouth was that it was the best film of the whole prequel trilogy, and even some people considered it ""a great addition to the saga"". Is this an accurate description of ""Revenge of the Sith""?
From the title itself you can perceive Lucas´ desperation to wrap-up the story, and the result of said desperation is the mess of a film that is ""Revenge of the Sith"". Again let's start by addressing the good elements: There is an actual story that has weight to the franchise, the CGI is vastly improved, the choreography is again impressive, my guiltiest pleasure in cinema (the action sequence in the senate room), and John Williams delivers the best score of the prequel trilogy. With the good out of the way, lets address the bad: The story is extremely rushed (this story should have been divided into ""Clones""), unearned and extremely unsatisfying; it tries to get emotions out of you but it fails as you don't even know the name of most of its characters (and the scenes that involve the characters you know you just don't care as the overall trilogy made them uninteresting characters), the amateurish directing prevails, bizarre attempts at comedy, again an oversaturation of CGI, it completely relies on the EU when a movie needs to stand on its own or at least to the other films, an unnecessarily amount of sterile action sequences that try too hard to distract you from this mess of a story,  an ending that desperately tries to emote some nostalgia in you, an insane amount of loose ends, probably the worst acting of the entire saga (since my review of ""Star Wars"", I said that I attribute this dreadful acting to Lucas´ directing, but with this film is either deadpan or extremely goofy), a surprising amount of unintentional comedy that actually made me laugh (I was in the floor laughing at the ""unlimited power"" scene), a surprisingly unfitting dark tone comparing to the kiddie first instalments, and Lucas tries too hard to make Shakespearean and Faustian parallels but they don't fit with this film.  
""Revenge of the Sith"" is undeniably the most enjoyable of the prequel trilogy but that doesn't make it good addition to the franchise. All the problems of this trilogy remain (I don't care how many action sequences or fancy CGI you throw at me, it doesn't distract me from the problems that the film contains). More entertaining but equally as bad."
"Jul 23, 2012",2.5,"Too much talking, too little Star Wars. The romance is dull and takes too much tame out of the possibly effective story."
"Jul 23, 2012",3.5,Darth Vader mask scene was the best part of the movie!
"Jul 23, 2012",3,"best of the new star wars movies, but can't beat the originals"
"Jul 23, 2012",3,not as good as the originals
"Jul 23, 2012",3.5,"The best of the ""prequel trilogy"" That's not saying much though..."
"Jul 22, 2012",4,Terrible directing but an excellent story.
"Jul 22, 2012",5,"""Revenge of the Sith"" is what I consider the best of the ""Anakin Skywalker trilogy"" of Star Wars! Great fight scenes, tense/dramatic acting, &amp; the beginning of the Dark Side leads Anakin to become Darth Vader!"
"Jul 22, 2012",4,"George Lucas' third prequel and final addition into his six movie saga is an outstanding conclusion to what had been a phenomenal franchise.

Continuing on a while after the Attack of the Clones and Jedi's Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are on a mission to rescue the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid).

As they enter the ship of General Grievous (voiced by Matthew Wood), Anakin appears to show signs of his darker personality when he shows little hesitation in assassinating Sith lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). However, the developing Jedi and Obi Wan are unable to capture the devious Grievous who exits his ship rapidly.

The plot then separates into two. While Obi Wan pursue's Grievous and duels with him in an epic battle, Anakin makes a shocking discovery on who the leader of the dark side actually is.

First of all I have to give a special mention to new character General Grievous, despite the new comer featuring in only the first half of the film. His robotic like appearance was expertly designed by the crew at Lucasarts; he gives off an intimidating vibe with his size and voice from Matthew Wood.

Also, the inevitable battle between Obi Wan and Anakin towards the films climax is stunning. The breathtaking imagery and choreography is frighteningly realistic and the duration of the battle is a staggering one; this maybe because it ties in with a second (slightly less epic duel) between Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Darth Sidious.

Overall, the effects are spectacular and sway the film into four star territory but the acting is equally solid. Mr. Lucas should be extremely proud with his creation which has expanded over four decades!"
"Jul 22, 2012",4,The tragic hero story told throughout the prequel trilogy and one of the greatest action sequences to date. A definite triumph over the last two films.
"Jul 22, 2012",4,Really really good. The best Star Wars prequel.
"Jul 22, 2012",3.5,"The best in the prequel trilogy. If only one had to made, this be the one~"
"Jul 22, 2012",4.5,Probably my favourite star wars film
"Jul 21, 2012",3.5,actually a good prequel thanks Lucas
"Jul 21, 2012",3,"After two terrible ""Star Wars'' films, George Lucas ends his saga in a surprisingly dark way. This is not the greatest Star Wars film, however it is the best out of the three. It's a major improvement from the first two, yet it is still bogged down by some of the same problems. The cast includes the same faces from episode two: Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, Ewan McGregor, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and several others. 

Not long after the Cone Wars, a new apprentice has risen. General Grievous has taken control over the Trade Federation (thank god), and the Frog Heads have been sent to the planet Mustafar. Anakin (Christensen) and Obi-Wan (McGregor) fly at the helm of a space battle as they seek out Grievous. Anakin kills Count Duku, his journey toward the dark side drawing near. The plot thickens as chancellor Palpatine seeks to become a permanent leader. Using Anakin, he manipulates him into thinking he can save Padme from death if he learns the way of the Sith.

Ultimately, this is the film some people have all been waiting for. This story didn't need to be told, but it was told anyway. It's about Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader. He was already a powerful character, arguably the most memorable Star Wars character ever, but for some reason Lucas felt he had to tell this story. Obviously, he just wanted to milk the franchise, but hey, we know that already. Thankfully, this is a decent film. Much better compared to it's predecessors. For starters, the acting is a little bit better. Hayden Christensen continues to give a lifeless performance, however he does have his moments where you think, ""Wow, where has this been?''. It's like they used all the bad takes of him and managed to use the good ones now and then. Ewan McGregor still is the star of the show, playing Obi-Wan with charm and believability. Natalie Portman isn't in the film that much but when she is she is still stale.

One of the big problems with the prequels are the attempts to talk politics. It was as if George watched Star Trek and said, ""Hey! I wanna try that!''. While Star Wars is my personal favorite space odyssey, I do enjoy Star Trek very much. The political discussions that Lucas attempts to use in the first two films are boring and repetitive. It's just not interesting political banter. Frog Heads talk for five minutes about how they want to remove Queen Amadala. It's just tiring. In episode three, the political conversations are a bit more interesting. There are talks of stabilizing other planets and systems, and overthrowing the Republic and transforming it into a Galactic Empire. One of the positives of this film are these discussions. Much more interesting. 

The action and special effects are fantastic! The first scene in the film is a starship battle. While not as memorable as the x-wings taking on the Death Star or the battle of Hoth, it's still great fun watching things unfold. The battle inside Grievous's ship is entertaining. The duel between Obi-Wan and Grievous, although very bloated, is fantastic! The Emperor versus Yoda is also very thrilling. The final battle of the film is also very exciting and heart pounding. 

In this film, the positives and negatives come to a perfect balance. It is neither a fantastic film, nor tremendously terrible. It splits right down the middle for me. The bad acting is still there. The lack of deep characters, engaging characters, enticing story, and nostalgia are still missing. The best compliment to the film is that on a visual level it's very entertaining. It just lacks heart. Many of the action sequences, although entertaining, eventually get quite bloated. 

In the end, ""Revenge of the Sith'' is a nice end to an unnecessary trilogy. It has great spectacle, fantastic choreography, thrilling special effects, and okay performances. The political banter is more interesting, and there are even a few moments of actuality great humor. The negatives and positives balance out, making this a flawed yet mostly enjoyable Star Wars film."
"Jul 20, 2012",4,"Easily the most satisfying installment of the trilogy, Revenge of the Sith packs the emotion punch needed to conclude this arc."
"Jul 20, 2012",4,Wraps up most of loose ends of the Saga and is easily the best of the Prequel Trilogy.
"Jul 20, 2012",2.5,the ending was so stupid i wish i never saw it
"Jul 18, 2012",2,good but i dont love it
"Jul 18, 2012",4,I REALLY liked Star Wars. Everything seemed so realistic. I think they did a VERY good job on the movie. It kept you in your seat till the very end.
"Jul 18, 2012",2.5,This was the best SW movie out of the first three episodes.
"Jul 18, 2012",5,pretty much liked it
"Jul 18, 2012",4.5,This was also pretty cool!!!! Love Star wars!
"Jul 18, 2012",3,Eh...not a huge Star Wars nut.
"Jul 18, 2012",4.5,Watched all the star wars movies with my brother. they are great. i think everyone should get them all
"Jul 18, 2012",4.5,A solid conclusion to the Star Wars saga.
"Jul 18, 2012",2,My least Favorite of the saga...
"Jul 17, 2012",4.5,"This was quite the action film. At times the acting is pretty poor, but its not awful the entire film. The CGI is top rate and the costumes are great. Very enjoyable."
"Jul 17, 2012",4.5,"An epic improvement over Episode One and Two. With an outstanding story and breathtaking visuals it is the essential film of the prequel trilogy. The film draws on Anakins turn to the dark side. It not only builds on the previous two, but it is actually stiff competition for the orginal trilogy. The final fight in the saga is when Ben Kenobi and Anakin is what the fights in most modern action films should look up too. It is a classic that is the best science fiction film before 2009's Star Trek"
"Jul 17, 2012",5,the most awesome star wars movie i ever see
"Jul 17, 2012",4,"Although frustratingly uneven, Revenge is still breathtakingly beautiful and deep enough to entertain and provide a satisfying conclusion to the prequel trilogy."
"Jul 17, 2012",2,You broke my heart George.
"Jul 16, 2012",5,my favorite MOVIE!!!
"Jul 16, 2012",5,"Hey, it's Star Wars...."
"Jul 16, 2012",3.5,"This film picks up Lucas' role in the Star Wars saga, finally doing it justice."
"Jul 16, 2012",5,Great finish to the best trilogy ever!
"Jul 15, 2012",4,Best of the newer movies.
"Jul 15, 2012",4,For me this is the most epic finale for a franchise.
"Jul 15, 2012",3,dont watch it.the boys do.and they love it
"Jul 15, 2012",3,good but as david always says the dialouge was terrible
"Jul 15, 2012",3,"Not the best in the saga, but a moving piece that tugs at the heartstrings, more so because of the overall story than its own stand-alone merit. Nice bridge into the classic trilogy, yet acting, along writing and directing, didn't improve much for the last film in the series... Again, too much action, too little story..."
"Jul 15, 2012",3,"Just a classic story star wars is..haha!  Nice movie, nothing really exciting."
"Jul 15, 2012",3,could've been better
"Jul 15, 2012",5,"I'm really fan since I was a teenager..so this is the episode, when Anakin turned in Darth Vader..good job!! for George Lucas crew ..good nominations it had!!"
"Jul 15, 2012",3,finally all the star wars movies made sense enjoyed it
"Jul 15, 2012",4.5,love the battle scenes
"Jul 15, 2012",4.5,amazing movie and an amazing way to end the saga
"Jul 14, 2012",5,A nice conclusion to the prequel trilogy.
"Jul 14, 2012",3.5,Vader is born. Nuff' Said.
"Jul 14, 2012",5,"Amazing, the best of all the movies I could go on forever but I won't I don't understand why Hayden Christensen is so unlicked, he's brilliant.  Maybe because his acting is so different he plays things in ways I could never think of and if you tried to reproduce his acting you couldn't George Lucas knew what ye was doing when he casted Hayden Christensen.  I was balling the whole time.  He certainly is under apreciarted.  He is such a character he alongside his fellow actors made this film."
"Jul 14, 2012",3.5,Dark movie which it needed to be with lots of action to go along with the Darth Vader story line
"Jul 14, 2012",4.5,"Ok yeah people hate this film cause it still has the dumb political stuff an focuses less on the force and more on a whiny, poorly-acted, dumb Anakin Skywalker. Is the writing fairly bad? Yeah. Were there some scenes that just dragged out forever and didn't know when to end? Yeah. But guess what, for all of its (numerous) flaws, I still LOVE this movie with its fantastic action and further insight to the Star Wars galaxy.

Bite me. 4.5/5"
"Jul 14, 2012",4,seen it too many times but still good show
"Jul 14, 2012",2,worst one of the saga
"Jul 14, 2012",4,"Best of the new trilogy, not as good as the originals"
"Jul 13, 2012",4.5,"Watch this back-to-back with Episode IV, and you'll realize what a fine accomplishment Episodes I-III really were, with Episode III: Revenge of the Sith being by far the finest.  Lucas and company do an exemplary job of illustrating the decline of the Jedi and the treachery of Senator/Emperor Palpatine, as well as the decay of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of Darth Vader.  Hayden Christensen, if not having shown capable acting chops anywhere else, was seemingly born to play the overly-emotional, conflicted, angsty Skywalker caught in the teeth of the persuasive and crazy evil Palpatine (played by a convincing and horrifying Ian McDiarmid).  In fact, everyone seems to fall into their role this time around.  As well, despite the overall bleak ending of this film, there is a great amount of campiness to Episode III, especially as Yoda recruits the Wookies to his cause, and Ewan McGregor becomes more comfortable with his silly one-liners as he plows through the Droids.  For the casual fan (ie one who hasn't read all the books, comics, and isn't well-versed in the lore), the clone armies, the allusions to Vader and Obi-Wan as learner and master,  how R2D2 and C3PO react (or don't) to returning to Tatooine, Obi-Wan's reawakening and even the magnitude of the brief encounter with the ""sand people"" in Episode IV are given greater import by Episode III.  Episode III was thus not just vital to making Episode's I and II even seem necessary, but vital to the back story of ""A New Hope"".  Overall, this was a spectacular installment to the Star Wars saga, and made the first two ""prequels"" all the more worthwhile."
"Jul 13, 2012",4,not the best star wars movie but good
"Jul 13, 2012",2.5,Poor Uncle George... *sigh*
"Jul 13, 2012",3.5,"a decent movie, the original star wars are waay better"
"Jul 13, 2012",4,"Definitely the best of the prequels, the film brings in tragedy, and manages to paint the fall of a anakin skywalker and the birth of darth vader in a tragic and entertaining way. The technology and worlds painted in the movie are very satisfactory, unfortunately general grevious does not stack up to other villains in the series such as Darth Vader, the emperor and count Dooku. And anakin can be kind of a pain in the ass sometimes."
"Jul 13, 2012",3.5,the best of the prequel trilogy.
"Jul 12, 2012",5,I don't care what anyone says...I love this movie! Of course the second trilogy doesn't match the original. There's no way it could but I think it's a great beginning and even though Hayden Christiii...long name isn't the greatest actor I loved him in this one
"Jul 12, 2012",3,"Anakin slowly goes to the dark side of The Force and becomes Sith Lord Darth Vader. ""NOOOOOOO"" that is the pussy line from the greatest villain of all time ""Dark Vader"". the visual effect's are good and the score is epic."
"Jul 12, 2012",5,One of the best Star Wars prequels ever made!
"Jul 12, 2012",1.5,"mmmm get me sum of dat lite sabor n shi doe, wnt to cchop dat grrl mouth rite off! dawg ma niggaz fo poo"
"Jul 12, 2012",4.5,This I must say was the darkest installment of star wars. But it truly revealed that torn personas within Anakin and opened your eyes to how the Empire came to be. A wonderful movie!
"Jul 12, 2012",5,how are you able to watch movies on this dam place
"Jul 12, 2012",3,Better of all the prequels. That's not saying much though.
"Jul 11, 2012",4.5,"great movie, kinda depressing at the end"
"Jul 11, 2012",3.5,The best of the new Trilogy.
"Jul 11, 2012",3,"even though Revenge is a better experience than Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones, it doesn't add anything that satisfying or compelling to the big picture."
"Jul 11, 2012",2,It's at least better than I and II.
"Jul 11, 2012",4,"People who hate on the prequels are not seeing RotS for what it is, an action packed fast paced, extremely dark birth of Darth Vader. Even if you hate the first 4 hours of the second trilogy, once the clone wars start and Yoda whips out a light saber Star Wars gets back to being what it always should be, an entertaining view into the sci fi world of our dreams."
"Jul 11, 2012",4,very exciting and lots of action
"Jul 10, 2012",5,best of the 6 in my opinion
"Jul 10, 2012",3.5,The last new star wars. Explained the transformation of Anikin to Darth Vader.
"Jul 10, 2012",5,Star Wars geek. There all awsome
"Jul 10, 2012",4,"Shit script, amazing everything else"
"Jul 10, 2012",3.5,"Obviously the best of the prequels however the tying of loose ends seemed a tad rushed and I was hoping for something a bit more imaginitive then lightening rebounded from a purple dildo looking Lightsaber to disfigure Palpatine. You did alright,Lucas"
"Jul 10, 2012",3.5,"I own this on Blu-Ray in a six movie pack along with:
* Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)
* Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones (2002)
* Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)
* Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)
* Star Wars Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi (1983)

and on DVD in a three movie pack along with:
* Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)
* Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones (2002)
;
and i also own the two-disc DVD."
"Jul 09, 2012",2.5,The problem with pre-queals is they always eclipse the earlier movies
"Jul 09, 2012",2,Where's the other 3 movies you promised Lucas?
"Jul 09, 2012",5,im a starwars geek all the way!
"Jul 09, 2012",4.5,"Among the best of the Prequel trilogy, it's epic in every sense of the word-from the impressive CGI battle over Courscant that opens the film, to Hayden Christensen's surprisingly emotional and powerful portrayal of the young Jedi's ultimate descent towards the Dark Side and final battle with his old master, Revenge of the Sith brings the original saga to a satisfying close."
"Jul 08, 2012",3.5,Im not too into star wars anymore
"Jul 08, 2012",0.5,Okay! Not a big Star Wars Fan!
"Jul 08, 2012",1.5,The other ones are SOOOO much better..
"Jul 08, 2012",2,boring except for a few action bits.
"Jul 07, 2012",4,I probably like it because I  love the Episode 1 and 2...
"Jul 07, 2012",4.5,It loses half a star for making me cry at the end.
"Jul 07, 2012",5,i admit it i am a starwars NEEERD!!!!!!
"Jul 07, 2012",2.5,"The eventual transition from Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader is ultimately the downfall of the third (and final) prequel film. Actor Hayden Christensen must've gained some newfound expertise at his craft whilst filming ""Shattered Glass"", as his performance in the first half of this movie is mesmerizing. Every scene shows the actor in constant contrast of his emotions, and it works perfectly. The second half of the film almost becomes what many films are nowadays with an expensive, computer-driven climax that doesn't have the weight that other installments had. Nonetheless, said effects are still impressive and hold up to this day. Finally, camerawork is sadly stale within this one, as shot/reverse-shot takes up a bulk of the movie, and the action is only framed appropriately within the first and last action sequence of the film."
"Jul 07, 2012",4,"Great show down between the Jedi &amp; the Sith, Go master YODA"
"Jul 06, 2012",2,"Lucas, what happened man?"
"Jul 06, 2012",3.5,It is definitely the best of the prequels but if you count the originals it is easily in 4th place
"Jul 06, 2012",2,not a big star wars fan
"Jul 06, 2012",2,my youngest brother loved it not me
"Jul 06, 2012",4,"Not amazing, but by far the best of the new three. And its friggin' Star Wars how can you not love it."
"Jul 05, 2012",3,"it is the best of the prequels because it has some plot points that tie in with the originals very well. but the dialogue and some of the acting is really bad and it is worth a watch if you have seen the original trilogy. if not, then skip it"
"Jul 05, 2012",4,"The 6th and final installment in the star wars saga is good, occasionally it's great but there are also some odd moments.

The first time i watched it i thought little of it and would have ranked it 5th out of the 6 films. But after a second viewing (i know 7 years late) my opinion of it has grown. The first half of the film is generally hit and miss with most of the hits being important battles with Dooku and Grievous and the misses involving political problems that despite being somewhat needed for the plot are still dull and boring.

The later is where it start to build up to what i consider one of the greatest ending to a film iv'e ever seen. The conversion from jedi to sith of Annakin is almost instant and the things he's immediately made to do are striking. The fight on mustafar is apt not only for dramatic affect but the hot nature of the planet is present in Obi Wan Kenobi and Annakin feel about each other.

Well worth a watch just not 'epic' enough throughout."
"Jul 05, 2012",0.5,"Jedi used to be noble mystics.  In this movie, they're just more action heroes. *sigh*"
"Jul 05, 2012",4,I liked it. Screw you all.
"Jul 05, 2012",5,my favorite star wars of all time.
"Jul 04, 2012",0.5,"One of the worst films I have ever seen. I hate the new Star Wars and I'm proud to say it! All the Star Wars movies are imperfect but the orginals had a soul. A solid soul. When the first Star Wars movie came out it was breath taking. Even to this day the CG is good. The acting, good, the script, ok, and the visuals, breath taking. Thats a good solid movie you got there. Back in the 70s there wasnt any other movie like Star Wars so it can get away with cheesy dialouge and slow scenes. However Mr. Lucas, that doesnt work now! There are far better science fiction movies out there that are competing with you. But you are still convinced that people will kiss your butt and like it beacause it is so unique. Yes, every science fiction movie borrows from Star Wars. But these films that borrowed from you are now better than you. All the prequals are trash. Trash, trash, trash. When Phantom Mennace came out we felt raped, when Attack of the Clones came out we felt raped. So whent he third was annouced the fans were desperate, you hear me desperate, to like the final Star Wars film. Its the last movie, therefore we must love it even if it is just as much crap as the last ones.  It is just as much crap as the last ones. Maybe even more. The dialogue is like nails on a chalk board while someone scrapes a fork against a metal plate. The acting is terrible (which is strage because the actors are good in other films). Terrible acting + horrible dialogue= holocaust of bad. The CG is great like always. However the Action and CG are far apart. I'm not an 8 year old kid who needs an orgasm of giant robots slugging it out, I love dramas built on dialoge. But when the dialouge is shit followed by horrendous acting all I want to see is the amazing CG. Whats sad is Lucas thinks is dialouge is great. So he shoves it down our throats. He should just stick to CG and have someone else direct his movies and actors. I feel offened this movie exists. I feel disusted that so many people still kiss this mans ass, and I feel assaulted by a holocaust of pain."
"Jul 04, 2012",5,I love all the starwars movies
"Jul 03, 2012",4,Yes please. Thank you.
"Jul 03, 2012",4,George Lucas sabe fazer um bom filme!
"Jul 03, 2012",2.5,"Although superior to the previous prequels, Lucas dulls what could have been a thrilling final chapter in his franchise with terrible dialogue and poor filmmaking choices."
"Jul 03, 2012",4.5,Probably the best of the new ones. Very entertaining.
"Jul 03, 2012",5,"Okay.. You have to see the others before it but this movie changed my whole view on star wars. I don't see Darth Vader as a villain anymore... He is just a tragic hero. 
This is my favorite of all SW films. It has great acting, a dark story, a great ending that segways into the original trilogy and left me jaw dropped. I suggest it to any sci-fi fan... Hell any movie goer would probably like this movie."
"Jul 02, 2012",3.5,a little dissappointed
"Jul 02, 2012",3.5,"Improving yet again with beautiful CGI effects, undeniable action sequences and confrontations that sets the movie to what it was made for. The last entry in the Star Wars prequel ends it with fans and moviegoers deeply attached with the plot, even though with Natalie Portman's terrible dialogue and miscast protaganist."
"Jul 02, 2012",3.5,"The movie made sense but it was very depressing.  Although I'm a great fan of Samuel L. Jackson, he seemed like a fish out of water in this role."
"Jul 02, 2012",2,Worst of the star wars movies by far
"Jul 02, 2012",5,IT IS AWESOME BEST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER.
"Jul 02, 2012",4,Best of the three prequels
"Jul 01, 2012",3,Give me the originals any day
"Jul 01, 2012",5,"I'm not a huge fan of Star Wars fan, but this was a very impressive final installment."
"Jul 01, 2012",1,"Im only giving it one star, only because Ewan Mcgregor is in it"
"Jul 01, 2012",4,"Pretty good would have been better if episode II wasn't so horrid. I actually liked episode I, which nobody else does."
"Jul 01, 2012",4.5,"For Star Wars fans this is a good film. It completes Anakin's demise into Darth Vader. Some may have panned this, but I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Jul 01, 2012",5,DING DING DING DING! WE HAVE A WINNER!!
"Jul 01, 2012",5,Superior to its predecessors
"Jun 30, 2012",3,at last we get to the truth of how it all began.
"Jun 30, 2012",5,I am absolutley sure about giving this movie 5 out of 5... Oh wait... only the sith speak in absolutes... DAMN!
"Jun 30, 2012",5,A great finale to the Star Wars saga!
"Jun 30, 2012",3.5,"By far the best out of the new trilogy. Was glad that they moved the rating up to PG-13, so that the dark nature of Anakin's turn could be encompassed in its true nature. However, there were still times that the dialogue was stilted, and it seemed like Lucas was too busy trying to make references to the original. And there's nothing like Vader at the end screaming, ""No!"""
"Jun 30, 2012",3,good film but cant beat the originals
"Jun 30, 2012",3,Nice lead up to the original
"Jun 29, 2012",4.5,"Awesome, I love Star Wars"
"Jun 29, 2012",3.5,"Bringing back what the original trilogy tried to establish, Revenge of the Sith is action packed and, tossed in with a bunch of cool characters, gives the series a suitable resting place."
"Jun 29, 2012",3,It's not bad. Not as bad as War of the Worlds! Ohhh! Ugh!
"Jun 29, 2012",3.5,Thoroughly enjoyable if not a bit cheesy.
"Jun 28, 2012",5,I am a star wars person...I loved it
"Jun 28, 2012",1.5,"better than the other prequels, but that's not saying much"
"Jun 28, 2012",1.5,sort of sucked compared to the old ones
"Jun 28, 2012",1,Fuck u starwars!  =D
"Jun 27, 2012",4,star wars fan big time!!  was alittle disappointed in this one though.
"Jun 27, 2012",4,Lot of fanservice. Incredible fun!
"Jun 27, 2012",1.5,"Everything built up to this moment and none of it feels real.  Anakin becomes a character that is completely unrelatable and once again, everything exists in a cartoony dream world where nothing is believable.  By far the best film of the prequels which is akin to being the thinnest kid at fat camp."
"Jun 27, 2012",2,"Kind of wasted potential. No matter which way I tried to look at it, while Ewan McGregor did a good job as Obi-Wan and Yoda was good since, well... he's animated, I cannot look past the bad acting of Hayden Christianson.

For Hayden and Natalie, I will say that this is not their shining moment. I'm pretty sure they don't want people to remember them from this movie. Granted the animation was great and choreography was great, bad acting and really poor groundwork from the previous two films and the fact that it didn't hold up as good as a movie on its own, it just didn't work. The animaton and choreography are carrying the stars in this review.

Furthermore, I just couldn't buy the forced relationship between Padme and Anakin, just... no. Still, Hayden's acting talent went through the roof when he finally put on the Darth Vader, voice distorting mask. That was the only time Anakin's acting was any good, and that was in the last ten minutes of the movie."
"Jun 27, 2012",4,Better than I or II-still not as good as the rest.
"Jun 26, 2012",4,Best lightsaber fight scene ever!!!
"Jun 26, 2012",5,"""From my point of view the Jedi are evil"".. George Lucas you can't write for shit but you sure do deliver on the special effects!"
"Jun 26, 2012",5,Went to midnight showing moment it came out... It rocks.. cuz im such a nerd
"Jun 26, 2012",3.5,"Easily the best of the prequel trilogy. On it's own with out comparison in regards to the original film. It has it's strong points, but when you consider the original trilogy it's just not close."
"Jun 25, 2012",3.5,"Too little, too late..."
"Jun 25, 2012",5,"Fin de un ciclo, épico cierre, un clásico impresionante."
"Jun 25, 2012",4,"As we come to a close with this arc of the Star Wars franchise, Anakin turns against the Jedi in an unconvincing way. Special Effects one again saves this film from its weak plot, but I won't bash the film for it. That's what it needed! It's the Extermination of the Jedi, and frankly, Visuals should be the storyteller of this installment! Definitely the best of the prequel trilogy, and a darn shame the series ends with the villain being triumphant."
"Jun 25, 2012",5,"One of my two favorite Star Wars films. This one is the most special one of them all I feel because it shows you how Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader. The overall tragedy of Anakin starts in Episode II when his mother is killed by the sand people and he brutally exacts revenge by kill the men, women, and the children. This gives you a glimpse of the Dark Side inside of Anakin and it reaches its peak in the third installment that completes the saga. I feel for Anikan in the fact that he has hate and anger hidden inside of him like I. But he decides to embrass the hate and the anger and in turn he becomes Lord Vader. I learned to keep mine in check lol. Without a doubt one of the best of the series."
"Jun 25, 2012",5,esta peli estuvo demasiado
"Jun 25, 2012",4,Best of the prequels
"Jun 25, 2012",1.5,"Sterile, awkward, too political, but it's finally over."
"Jun 24, 2012",5,Great movie.... It's at this time I realize how much of a... whats the right word.... nerd(?)... I am.
"Jun 24, 2012",0.5,The acting is sooo bad.
"Jun 24, 2012",5,Star Wars nerd so i loved it
"Jun 24, 2012",5,"Intense, passionate, happy, sad. It was great."
"Jun 24, 2012",2.5,"The prequel trilogy doesn't do any justice to the original films. The editing is sloppy, characters aren't interesting, and plot devices are recycled. Also Jar-Jar. In short, these films were unnecessary. But as far as Revenge of the Sith is concerned, it's the least terrible of the three. That's not saying it's particularly good, because it's full of terrible pacing, awful characterization, and plot holes. It's saying that out of a basket of rotting apples, this is the one that would only make you seriously ill, instead of killing you."
"Jun 24, 2012",5,"Star Wars, my childhood fav."
"Jun 24, 2012",0.5,"Good movie with interesting effects, i think.  whocares what you think! i just like the damn movie."
"Jun 24, 2012",3.5,Best of the bad ones.
"Jun 23, 2012",2,I'd prefer you didn't watch it.
"Jun 23, 2012",1.5,At least the train wreck is over.
"Jun 23, 2012",1,"Worst acting, writing, directing I've seen in such a high calibre franchise."
"Jun 23, 2012",5,great one of the best in the series
"Jun 23, 2012",0.5,Didn't like it very much!
"Jun 22, 2012",5,best star wars movie ever
"Jun 22, 2012",5,Who could live without Star Wars?
"Jun 22, 2012",4.5,great way to end it. kept me excited till the end
"Jun 22, 2012",3,The only Prequel Star Wars movie that was half decent(Only because it was the only prequel that  tried to stay true to the original Trilogy). Natalie Portman.
"Jun 22, 2012",5,"While it's an overall solid movie and the best Star Wars since Empire, there's too many obviously blatant plot holes and the acting and dialogue is pretty bad. It's frustrating because I do like it."
"Jun 21, 2012",4.5,"La mejor de las precuelas y mi favorita en general. Posee una historia mas dinamica y oscura, momentos con suspenso impactantes, una mejor evolucion de los personajes principales (incluyendo al de Anakin), el romanticismo entre Natalie y Hayden es mucho mas creible al poseer esa chispa que le hacia falta a su antecesora, las escenas de accion son mucho mas fluidas y posee temas muy interesantes entre las conspiraciones y traicion. Un gran cierre con broche de oro"
"Jun 21, 2012",4.5,anakin is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute
"Jun 21, 2012",3,Good but the originals are better.
"Jun 21, 2012",4,Incredibly well-done ending to an incredibly incredible series.
"Jun 21, 2012",3.5,good emotional happy sad movie great deff
"Jun 21, 2012",2,"Easily the best of the prequel trilogy, but that's like saying eating brussels sprouts if better than eating straight dirt."
"Jun 21, 2012",4.5,"It expands the universe even more and some of the fights are just amazing. Same go for the special effects. Some acting is still really bad and sometimes they overuse special effects. We finally get some explanations to how Palpatine and Anakin turn to the dark side. We finally see the Wookies and they fight which took way too long. They should have had General Grievous be like he was in the show Star Wars Clone Wars and not some annoying android who's more powerful than the others. I can't bring myself to say I like better than the second one, but is still a great movie."
"Jun 21, 2012",3,The ending scene is worth watching the long ObiWan-Grevious cat and mouse. Good Movie.
"Jun 21, 2012",4,"A good conclusion to the star wars saga, however the final has nothing on the first two films that George Lucas created."
"Jun 20, 2012",0.5,i don't see how george lucas ever put out the first three movies after what he did with the prequals
"Jun 20, 2012",5,STAR WARS!!!!!!!!!!! oh yea nuff said
"Jun 20, 2012",4,"Underrated largely due to lingering backlash from its two predecessors. Not only the best of the prequels, ""Sith"" is at least equal to ""Return of the Jedi"" (the least of the original trilogy in my opinion). ""Sith"" has the best visual effects, acting, and dialogue of the prequel series. It features a sweeping score by John Williams. And it tells the story we had to wait through Episodes I and II for. Best of all, there is but one shot of Jar-Jar Binks in this film, and he is mute. 

There are terrible moments, mostly between Anakin and Padme, but I must praise Ewan McGregor for doing his most spot-on Alec Guiness impersonation to date. The most memorable performance comes from Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine, who gets to outshine his own performance from ""Jedi"". This was the only ""Star Wars"" film not to recieve recognition for visual effects from the Oscars, which is odd, as I felt it had better effects than its prequel predecessors. It did, however, get a Best Makeup nomination (a first for the saga)."
"Jun 20, 2012",1,I watched the bit where he becomes Vader and all that. It was meh. I hate Star Wars- it's cheesy as hell.
"Jun 20, 2012",1,makes no damn sense. for extra detail see the plinkett review
"Jun 20, 2012",3,Entertaining at the very least.
"Jun 20, 2012",2,"Dissapointing movie, still has good special effects."
"Jun 20, 2012",0.5,I don't enjoy the scent of garbage. So why would I enjoy the sight of it?
"Jun 20, 2012",3.5,Es la mejor de la saga!!! Una excelente actuacion de Hayden Christensen!!
"Jun 20, 2012",4.5,I have always liked the Star War movies...
"Jun 20, 2012",0.5,Um...the prequels shouldn't have the name Star Wars on them.
"Jun 19, 2012",5,there is no flaw in this movie...wait...the love story
"Jun 19, 2012",3,love star wars but they could have done better
"Jun 19, 2012",1,The most boring future  ever created. And some horrible acting to boot.
"Jun 19, 2012",3,Easily the best of the prequel series. But still not in the same league as the originals.
"Jun 19, 2012",0.5,People need to re-watch this drivel.  It's very easily the worst piece of Star Wars fiction since the Holiday special.  It makes the first two prequels look like the Original Trilogy.
"Jun 19, 2012",3,never watched the movie
"Jun 19, 2012",5,I liked it. I was wondering when Lucas was going to make this one!
"Jun 19, 2012",4,The best movie in my entire life. I do not understand people who prefers the old star wars movies. The old ones a stupid and I don't get them.
"Jun 19, 2012",3.5,The first three episodes were just disappointing to me.  Acting is lousy (especially Hayden Christensen).
"Jun 19, 2012",4.5,gotta love star wars
"Jun 19, 2012",0.5,"Needs a reluctant rewatch, but for now I'll base my rating on predominant failure to provide interest for general audience members, in addition to the half-hour or so of the climax, when the amplified sound awoke me. Not that its much of this particular outing from the franchise's fault, as I've generally not been keen on Star Wars lore period, much less of the prequels, but Episode III includes several portions that epitomize the unnecessary, lifeless, drab launch of the triplex addition to the saga. It's slightly better than the wordy, plainly intermediary Episode II owing to the dramatic structure of the finale, crafted rather sweetly due to an expected yet rapid and arresting switch in arrangements in character and events, but still stands behind Episode I's jolted first-taste installation. That neat moment exclusive to prequels seeing how writers creatively weave story arcs from two different films, somewhat justifying their existence, pretty much explains the sacrificing of so much badly written and executed cinema spread throughout the three Episodes in exchange for propping up the scenes that gave birth to the franchise (The connecting conclusion of Episode III was probably the first thing in mind, forcing the script writing to work backwards). So if any time has been wasted in any film, one might as well be compensated in the form of this film's conclusion, basically. Otherwise, the most overhyped galactic borefest of our time, with a (dare I mention it?) null lead actor mirroring the bane of the film industry, and dialogue fit for a suffering insomniac. I only wish I could've seen all of it so I could berate it properly."
"Jun 19, 2012",4,i dont like star wars very much but this was a badass movie.
"Jun 18, 2012",5,"compared to 1 and 2. This was a classic. But still NOTHING compares to the ""first"" three (or am I dating myself)"
"Jun 18, 2012",4.5,"It is the best of the prequel series but it will never match the original trilogy.  This could have been better, but I liked it because the pacing was much faster."
"Jun 18, 2012",4.5,love the darkness. story. and the final battle. well made movie. great ending to the new trilogy
"Jun 18, 2012",3.5,Finally saw this. It has its moments but overall its an ok film... the best one is still The Empire Strikes back...
"Jun 18, 2012",3,"It's not the best of the three, though probably the most childish. Still there are some classic moments here so I must say I kinda'  dug it."
"Jun 18, 2012",5,I'm a super Star Wars fan.
"Jun 18, 2012",4.5,About time we got to this one.
"Jun 18, 2012",4,"""I hate you"" and ""From my point of view, the jedi are evil"" are the only two lines that drag down this movie. But the pure bad-assery of it makes it worth watching."
"Jun 18, 2012",4,Truly one of the best sci fi films of our time
"Jun 17, 2012",5,"very dark movie, loved the work put into this... i felt the pain, sorrow, and betrayal"
"Jun 17, 2012",0.5,A disgrace to Star Wars
"Jun 17, 2012",3,"One comment: ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"""
"Jun 17, 2012",3,"Probably the best film of the prequels. That's not saying much, though."
"Jun 16, 2012",2,So how about that prequel trilogy?
"Jun 16, 2012",5,"not as good as the originals by a long shot, but good fun"
"Jun 16, 2012",5,One of the bes movies of Star Wars!
"Jun 16, 2012",3.5,waited long to see this one big fan
"Jun 16, 2012",3,could have been a lot better.
"Jun 16, 2012",0.5,wasnt into it..Too many Star
"Jun 16, 2012",5,Absolutely wonderful!
"Jun 16, 2012",4,Not bad how it tied the 1st and 2nd trilogies together.
"Jun 15, 2012",4.5,i loved it. It was alot better than I and II but of course still doesn't compare to the others. over great action and effects
"Jun 15, 2012",5,"Loy Machedo's Movie Review - Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith 
I will simply say this - It is the Crowning Moment of all the Star Wars Episodes which have ever taken place. I highly recommend you watch the making of this movie (courtesy Bonus DVD) and you will be amazed as to why 900+ top notch professionals were employed &amp; involved for weeks in making one particular scene which lasted less than one minute. Leaves you with nothing but respect for one of the greatest Movie Directors of all times - George Lucas.
Overall Rating - A Perfect 10 out of 10.

"Jun 15, 2012",3.5,"hayden christensen is a HORRIBLE actor, but i ABSOULTLY LOVE the rest of the movie, and i hated it when he killed all the little kids...*sob*...could u give me a minute...anyways, and hu in their right mind would not luv ewan mcgregor!!"
"Jun 15, 2012",2,"Decent on the surface, but unspeakably bad when you pay attention. A textbook example of when CGI ruins a movie. Though the script doesn't help."
"Jun 15, 2012",3,better than 1 &amp; 2 but still nowhere near the original trilogy
"Jun 15, 2012",4.5,that was so awsome I think that movie was the best.
"Jun 15, 2012",4,"This is a prime example of a film that has not been given a fair shake.  The plot was fast paced and gripping, the action was best of any Star Wars films, the lines were ...okay not so great...but overall this was a decent addition worthy of being called a Star Wars film.  And this is coming from a die hard Star Wars fan.

Unfortunately the film simply will never be considered more than okay for a few reasons:

1.  Hayden Christensen - Clearly a terrible choice (but episode II sealed this one).  Comes off as more of spoiled kid than a torn anti-hero, but this may be bad script writing

2. Lack of Suspense - By virtue of being a prequel, we know everything that is going to happen.  In 1980, the line ""I am your father"" stunned audiences across the country, but everyone knows that now.  And we also know about Palpatine and and can easily put two and two together about the troopers.

3. The fans - You gotta admire dedication.  But some people just take things too far.  When you have people that burst into tears over 3 seconds of footage added in the remastered edition, you know things are not going to end well.

4.  The other prequels - Guilt by association.  The other two sucked, so this one gets grouped with them.

Conclusion - Overall an okay, albeit a flawed presentation of the Star Wars universe."
"Jun 15, 2012",3,the best of the worst...
"Jun 14, 2012",3,I wanted to see more Darth Vader
"Jun 14, 2012",5,"Solo para amantes del genero, haters gonna hate."
"Jun 14, 2012",3.5,"Anikan Could have ruined this movie if it wasn't for the great tone, effects and set up. B"
"Jun 14, 2012",5,never can go wrong with star wars
"Jun 14, 2012",5,"people always complain about the prequels. yes, there was jar-jar binks, yes, darth maul died. yes, he is dead, clone wars is wrong. but this movie was an astounding film for fans and wrapped up the saga's plot points, connecting the trilogies. now yes, this film had its faults, general grevious was a dissapointment, anakin did whine alot, and PADME NOBODY LIKES YOU. but as soon as darth vader takes his first breathe, you remembered why you love this saga. Vader's creation is one of the greatest moments in cinema history in my eyes. and the action? incredible. and the soundtracks to go with them are pitch perfect and make them incredible. this is also a very strong story that answers alot of questions. this film is one of the best sci-fi films ever, regardless of anakin and padme, this movie is one of my favorite movies ever."
"Jun 14, 2012",5,the path to the dark side...
"Jun 14, 2012",2,"Better than episode 1 &amp; 2, but still just not very good. Ewen Mcgregor saved these movies from being totally awful. The final battle between Obi-wan and Anakin was cool, but totally overdone."
"Jun 13, 2012",4,This is a awesome movie! Except i only watched it once cuz we don't have it.
"Jun 13, 2012",3.5,"Almost as bad as Attack of the Clones and highly overrated. Revenge of the Sith is full of cheesy moments and is way too colorful for its dark topic of Anakin succumbing to the dark side. However, its ending is certainly emotional and a satisfying link to A New Hope"
"Jun 13, 2012",2.5,"""Naoh! Naoh! Naoh! YOU WILL DIE!!!"" Yeah, some parts of this movie were at least so bad they were funny but this movie made this mistake of trying to be good and ruined all the fun I was having laughing at the bad scenes..."
"Jun 13, 2012",3,could have been better.
"Jun 13, 2012",3,The best out of all the star wars movie.
"Jun 13, 2012",5,"If it was any other movie it would be a 2....But hey, its Star Wars"
"Jun 13, 2012",2,"I fell asleep during it, but it looked really good before i snoozed."
"Jun 13, 2012",5,"Lucas has done everything for Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. It is a truly beautiful tale of a young man corrupted by power to stop his greatest nightmare from becoming reality - losing the person he loves. In a desperate move he bows before a Sith Lord who over throws his mind and causes him to kill his lover which gives him a final push down a path that is nearly impossible to stop going down. Emotionally and psychologically layered, flawlessly."
"Jun 13, 2012",5,"Star Wars is kewl. Light sabers, good vs evil and ewoks."
"Jun 13, 2012",2,"I'm temped to give it a higher rating based on the ""so-bad-it's-hilarious"" qualities of it, but really, it's pretty much shit."
"Jun 13, 2012",3.5,worthy addition to the installments
"Jun 13, 2012",1,So wrong....sooooo wrong.
"Jun 13, 2012",2.5,Great but not as good as the original set.
"Jun 13, 2012",4.5,loved it! best out of all of them!
"Jun 13, 2012",3.5,Better than Episodes I &amp; II; good segue into A New Hope.
"Jun 13, 2012",5,All the Star Wars movies get my favorites.
"Jun 12, 2012",2,"made for kids, not for fans"
"Jun 12, 2012",5,"One of my favorite movies ever, Yes I am a Star Wars fan!"
"Jun 12, 2012",4,At least they gave the role of anikin Skywalker to Hayden Christensen because of his great acting skills. :/ jkkkkkk. Besides his disastrous acting the movie keeps the end of the beginning trilogy alive. I think hayden was better when he put on the Darth Vader helmet because i didn't have to see his annoying face!
"Jun 12, 2012",5,it was interesting but cool
"Jun 12, 2012",5,Dark dark dark. Loved it.
"Jun 12, 2012",4,"Hey, it's better than Return of the Jedi."
"Jun 12, 2012",1,not big star wars fan
"Jun 12, 2012",3,Not too partial to this one
"Jun 12, 2012",3,Seen ending and from what I've seen it looked good
"Jun 12, 2012",2.5,"Well, it's Star Wars, but it still sucked.  Better than the others in this misguided trilogy, but still not great."
"Jun 12, 2012",5,The best of the prequel trilogy and the one that truly delivers.
"Jun 12, 2012",5,Good ending to the new trilogy
"Jun 11, 2012",3,liked the older ones better
"Jun 11, 2012",2.5,Erm...the ending sucked.
"Jun 11, 2012",5,Tihs was an awesome movie. Not as good as the originals but the best of the prequels. Even Hayden Christensen didn't bother me so much in this one. Awesome to finally see the creation of Darth Vader.
"Jun 11, 2012",3,It's no original but clever.
"Jun 11, 2012",4.5,"Everything in this episode is remarkable and makes it one of the best in the series. It's a great finish for a saga started 28 years before but the biggest mistake George Lucas did was giving the main role which is ""Anakin Skywalker"" to a terrible actor ""Hayden Christensen"". The story is as usual epic, the visuals are praised, the soundtrack is good, but the script can be better."
"Jun 11, 2012",0.5,"Thanks for ruining Star Wars, George."
"Jun 11, 2012",3.5,Hayden Christenson is so hott..but a bad actor..
"Jun 11, 2012",4,this is my favorite out of all the star wars movies
"Jun 11, 2012",5,Una de mis favoritas.
"Jun 11, 2012",4,"I'm a Star Wars geek, sue me.  It did what I wanted it to do except for the lame lovers' banter.  ugh."
"Jun 10, 2012",1,dont love astrology that much bt it made ma day
"Jun 10, 2012",5,Best of the new trilogy
"Jun 10, 2012",4.5,A pleasing final chapter of the Star Wars saga.
"Jun 10, 2012",5,Great movie but very sad
"Jun 10, 2012",3.5,why did they put the third one last
"Jun 10, 2012",3,i'm star warsed to death
"Jun 10, 2012",5,Better much better than Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of The Clones and a very good end to the prequel trilogy.
"Jun 09, 2012",2,"Sorry, 4-6 are way better!"
"Jun 09, 2012",4,never really was a fan but this one was good
"Jun 09, 2012",2,dont like this movie
"Jun 09, 2012",3.5,"A star wars movie that is finally a step in the right direction. The acting was great, special effects were great, and so was the soul moral message of the film. All of it was there but unfortunately it wasn't enough to earn a full 4 star rating."
"Jun 09, 2012",5,Loved all of the Star Wars
"Jun 08, 2012",0.5,"to quote the film ""I can't bear to watch"""
"Jun 08, 2012",3.5,Acting lft something to be desired
"Jun 08, 2012",3.5,Could've been so much better
"Jun 08, 2012",5,"Revenge of the Sith is the most epic and important Star Wars film not just because it plows through the flaws of the other prequels rather than floundering in them, but because Lucas finally treats his characters as the operatic legends that they are."
"Jun 08, 2012",3,"Taking from classic mythology and Roman history, Revenge of the Sith brings the series out of the premortial ooze that was its two predecessors, and reminds fans why they liked Star Wars to begin with."
"Jun 08, 2012",4,"For entertainment and sentimental value, I enjoyed it."
"Jun 08, 2012",3,best of the ridiculous trilogy.  midichlorians?...you dumb-ass.
"Jun 08, 2012",3,One of my favorites had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.Action packed.
"Jun 07, 2012",5,I've seen all the Star War's Movies when I was little my uncle was a fan lol.
"Jun 07, 2012",4,"Star Wars is magnificent, and this was a pleasant surprise after episodes 1 and 2. While it was good, it's still nothing compared to the original trilogy."
"Jun 07, 2012",3,Pretty good i liked it!
"Jun 07, 2012",5,"Possibly my favorite of the six. It gets so emotional and intense and ties in to the original films so well. And fuck you all, I love Hayden Christensen as Anakin"
"Jun 07, 2012",5,esta padre esta pelicula
"Jun 07, 2012",3,it pissed me off that anakin went bad he was a freakin babe
"Jun 07, 2012",3,"Its geting 3 and a half stars in comparison to the previous two movies.  But seriously, this whole ""second"" trilogy could have been done better.  The last film is how Ep 1 and II should have been."
"Jun 07, 2012",4.5,"The best of the prequels. Truly... an epic of heroes, villains, and creatures from a thousand worlds. A billion years in the making before a new hope."
"Jun 07, 2012",4,"The third prequel was actually good, the first two left something to be desired."
"Jun 07, 2012",3.5,"Tons of effects, lots of action but lacking some of the charm of the original series.  Still worth watching and having in your dvd collection"
"Jun 07, 2012",5,"Great movie, my favorite one of the series. Anakan was a bad ass, not a nerd in the other two."
"Jun 06, 2012",5,"Good movie, u have to like all this stuff though."

"Jun 04, 2012",5,"A suprisingly perfect and mind-blowing completion to the Star Wars saga. Compared to the original trilogy, this movie is crap, but for the prequels, this is a god."
"Jun 04, 2012",4,I love all Star Wars
"Jun 04, 2012",3.5,i like it cuz a hayden christansen of course
"Jun 04, 2012",5,Special effects are AMAZING.  The darkest of all the movies.  Does a great job explaining how Anakin turns to Vader.
"Jun 04, 2012",2,worst of the star wars
"Jun 04, 2012",4.5,An excellent segway into the original trilogy
"Jun 04, 2012",5,"I loved it. OBi wan kenobi and Anikan Skaywalkers battle was great. Yoda and Chancler Palpatines battle was great to. Ewan Mcgregor and Hayden Christensen and Keny Baker and Anthony Daniels and Ian Mcdirmind and Frank oz and Samual L Jackson and Nateliea Portman star has the roles in star wars Episode 3 Revenge of the sith. R2D2 C3po and Mace Windu and Chancler Palpatine and princes Padema. Its a good movie. I love all The
me action. Hayden Christensen plays Anikan Skywalker and Ewan Mcgregor plays jedi master Obi Wan Kenobi and Kenny Baker plays R2D2 and Ian Mcdermind plays Chancler palpatine a. k. a. Darth Sidiece and Samuel L. Jackson plays Jedi master Mace Windu and Frank oz plays grand master Yoda and Natilie Portman plays Padme and Jermey Buloch plays Captain Colton. George Lucas does a masterpiece. Second best one. 5 stars."

"Jun 04, 2012",4,Ah that's better - darkness and light
"Jun 04, 2012",4,This was a seriously enjoyable film. Superb special effects and excellent action. It's exciting and smart. The best of the prequels
"Jun 03, 2012",4.5,Defiantly the best of the prequels showing us  how star wars was a masterpiece.
"Jun 03, 2012",3,Anikin is so hot i just get mad how he turns into darth vader
"Jun 03, 2012",3.5,was actually pretty good
"Jun 02, 2012",3.5,not me but again the kids loved it
"Jun 01, 2012",4,The best one of the new trilogy.
"Jun 01, 2012",5,Now this is a cool movie!! it's totally two thumbs up!!
"Jun 01, 2012",5,dude i luv star wars!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 01, 2012",0.5,The most disappointing return to this story I could imagine. It all comes down to the script and the director. I think the actors were allowed to do whatever they wanted which proved the theory that without direction a film is doomed to fail with or without a budget.
"Jun 01, 2012",4.5,"Epic! While most of the other Star Wars films managed to be ""really cool!"" This one actually got me really emotionally attached and even crying by the end! It's a sci-fi Shakespear, though the first twenty minutes weren't all that great."
"May 31, 2012",4,I saw it and is was decent.
"May 31, 2012",5,Words can describe how much I love these movies.
"May 31, 2012",5,"Star Wars is cool!  After this one, I am still tempted to go rent or get the rest of them... cuz i haven't seen the other ones..."
"May 31, 2012",3,nice to see the story come together so well
"May 31, 2012",4.5,what can i say? im a star wars fan!
"May 31, 2012",3,I only watched maybe an hour of it.But i heard its good from start to finish.
"May 31, 2012",4,"Arguably the best film of the Prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith distantly feels like the Original films.  Hayden Christensen is a bit better as Anakin Skywalker.  Ewan McGregor, once again, does Obi-Wan Kenobi justice.  However, Ian McDiarmid steals the show as the Emperor."
"May 31, 2012",5,The force is strong with this one.
"May 30, 2012",5,An awesome ending to a fantastic franchise and childhood favorite of mine. This movie reminds old Star Wars fans why they love the mythology in the first place and shows new Star Wars fans how great this series really is.
"May 30, 2012",5,"Clearly the prequel George had wanted to tell since the release of Jedi, Revenge Of The Sith is , in my opinion, the 3rd best of the star wars films."
"May 30, 2012",5,There isn't much to say. It was a great movie.
"May 30, 2012",5,there's not enough stars for this movie.
"May 30, 2012",0.5,crap! I hate Star Wars!
"May 30, 2012",4.5,"Not quite as good as Clones, but has plenty of fun, jaw-dropping moments and emotionally satisfying pay-offs to make up for its many stumbles."
"May 30, 2012",3.5,felt that the movie was well done and filled a bunch of gaps
"May 30, 2012",3,Im not really into star wars though some people may like it more than me
"May 29, 2012",2,Give me the first three movies any day!
"May 29, 2012",5,Anwsered all my questions.
"May 29, 2012",3,"A great ending to one of the best movie series ever done.  But I think it could've been pushed even more on the emotional part, in a different way also. But I really liked Anakin's character in that one, Hayden Christensen did a really great job, we can see the conflict between good and evil that twists him until he loses everything and finishes without any attaches to the side that isn't dark...In all the prequel movies, this one is strictly the best, even if it isn't even close to the kind of power and strength of the first trilogy."
"May 29, 2012",5,love all star wars movies
"May 29, 2012",5,love all the Star wars movies!!!
"May 28, 2012",5,Awesome to see how Darth Vader is born.  This is the flick that made me finally notice Hayden!
"May 28, 2012",4,better than i thought
"May 28, 2012",5,STAR WARS IS AWESOME. Period.
"May 28, 2012",3,"Great effexts, but, the story is getting tired!"
"May 27, 2012",5,The other two were alright but this was awesome there was action adventure and drama it might have its flaws but it a hell of a lot of fun
"May 27, 2012",5,KIDS REALLY LIKED THIS ONE
"May 27, 2012",3,this movie made me mad lol
"May 26, 2012",5,ANAKIN IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HOT
"May 26, 2012",4.5,The final battles are worth the price of admission.
"May 26, 2012",2,kinda like this movie!!!
"May 26, 2012",2,im noot realy into star wars
"May 26, 2012",5,Great Film. George Lucas is a genius.
"May 26, 2012",5,an awesome movie and great way to tell us what happened and how Darth Vader came to be
"May 25, 2012",2,haven't seen it yet but I will ONE day
"May 25, 2012",1,im not a big fan of this kind of movie
"May 25, 2012",3,Better then episode 1 and 2 it feels more like the original trilogy despite Hayden Christensen's poor acting
"May 25, 2012",3,Best of the new = still not that good.
"May 25, 2012",4.5,"There was too much CG, but nevertheless, amazing film. The music was phenomenal."
"May 25, 2012",4,I feel like George Lucas was trying to hard to make another good Star Wars movie.
"May 25, 2012",2.5,"Enjoyable when first released, but less and less so with each subsequent viewing."
"May 24, 2012",4,The original is still the best but Lucas made a great tie together with this final chapter.
"May 24, 2012",0.5,"Well, it's a step up from the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.  But what does that say?"
"May 24, 2012",3,"It was 2 movies in 1.  The first half was awful, Grievous didn't do what was intended, but the second half was much better.  This was Ian McDiarmid's film"
"May 24, 2012",2,Didn't finish watching it
"May 24, 2012",5,what a way to answer all those questions from when we were young.
"May 24, 2012",3,someone needs to teach Anakin how to act
"May 24, 2012",2,"Use the force, use the force to make a better film."
"May 24, 2012",5,never like any of the others but love this one
"May 23, 2012",5,How can you not like it? Seriously....You have to hate Star Wars to give this a bad review...
"May 23, 2012",5,"Epic Lightsaber battles, Natalie Portman being really hot and a cheesy script, what's not to love?"
"May 23, 2012",5,"some things i like about Episode III: The opening scene is epic! Grievous is Awesome!!
The wookie planet Kashyyk was fantastic,Chewbacca being back was Super amazing, the movie have great funny scenes while being Dark at the same time. i LOVE when Yoda throws the Red Knights of the emperor to the floor!!,all the lightsabers duels were fantastic,the emperor Darth Sidious was awesome so was his battle with Yoda,The battle on Mustafar Anakin VS Obi Wan was so epic and so was the setting, watching Vader for the first time on the theater on his custom was something very Special! the ending scenes are excellent! Just the End of The Beginning!"
"May 23, 2012",4,Luke I am your father
"May 22, 2012",2,"I'm noticing a pattern with the prequel trilogy...the lower the IQ, the higher the rating."
"May 22, 2012",4,I only saw half of it.
"May 22, 2012",5,seen it with my mom in theaters and kind of scary!!!
"May 22, 2012",3.5,Best movie from the new trilogy. The light-saber fighting scenes are really well choreographed
"May 22, 2012",5,Finally the saga is complete... well sort of
"May 21, 2012",2.5,none as good as the first three
"May 21, 2012",2,still not great...Ewan McGregor's performance is brilliant. It's the only thing really worth taking note of in any of the prequels
"May 21, 2012",4.5,Gives a completely new prospective to the original 3
"May 21, 2012",3.5,"Great opening scene, it was a chore watching the love story, then more action, followed by more chore, then the epic Yoda, then Vader shows his new evil colors, with the last drama filled scenes that led to the half dead Darth we all know and love/hate."
"May 21, 2012",5,best of the new trilogy movies
"May 20, 2012",5,"This one I liked partially bc i'm a recent star wars fan, but also bc i thought this movie answered all of the in- between questions."
"May 20, 2012",1,not what i thought it would be
"May 20, 2012",5,I'm a big star wars fan and an even bigger darth vader fan. this movie is all about how vader turns to the dark side. http://mpidyong.tumblr.com/
"May 20, 2012",4.5,Great movie. Love seeing Darth Vader becoming the terror that he is in the last 3 episodes.
"May 20, 2012",5,Top 5 favorite movie of all time. Best of the entire series.
"May 20, 2012",5,Saw it at the midnight showing and it rocks!
"May 20, 2012",5,The only Star Wars movie better than this one is the Empire Strikes Back!
"May 20, 2012",4,The use what is essentially magic but the story is based outside of reality.
"May 20, 2012",5,The best of the new Star Wars movies compares favorably with the original star wars movies.
"May 19, 2012",4,By far the best of the prequels. A very well written conclusion to combine the two trilogies and end the saga.
"May 19, 2012",3.5,"Best of the prequels, despite wooden acting from Hayden C."
"May 19, 2012",4,not bad bought it anyway
"May 19, 2012",5,Legend! What more can i say.
"May 18, 2012",3,Not as near as good as the original trilogy.
"May 18, 2012",1.5,Purely effects driven.  Entertaining as long as you can get past the dull acting.
"May 17, 2012",4,I like star wars movies because I've been watching it since I was a lil boy.
"May 17, 2012",4,very good i love star wars lack of darth vadar was disapointing
"May 16, 2012",1,not into star wars at all.......
"May 16, 2012",5,Cool special effects
"May 16, 2012",4.5,Part of a cinematic saga that will live forever!  It doesn't get much better than this!
"May 16, 2012",5,Best New Star wars Movie
"May 16, 2012",2,"okay so I get them all confused is this the newest one, the one they just made well if it is the only person I like in it is Natalie Portman *(queen amidala ) she is the only one who can act, they cast the wrong one for Aniken that boy is not a good actor"
"May 15, 2012",1.5,Great storyline and special effects -- cheesiest lines in the history of cheesy lines!!!
"May 15, 2012",3,Not that big of a star wars fan!
"May 15, 2012",4,"Besides Hayden, this movie has good acting, story, effects, and action. George Lucas finally got a Star Wars prequel right!"
"May 15, 2012",5,Great movie. Best part is the NOOOOOO by Darthy Darth
"May 15, 2012",4.5,Most dramatic star wars movie.
"May 14, 2012",3.5,"Best part? ""Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"""
"May 14, 2012",5,"kick ass, makes more sence if you watched all 6 in order"
"May 14, 2012",3,so depressing--but everyone knew it would come to this...
"May 14, 2012",3.5,They definitely saved the best for last!
"May 14, 2012",5,"awesome movie, I've seen it three times!"
"May 14, 2012",5,"very good, action packed, thrilling didnt know star wars was so good"
"May 14, 2012",3.5,not bad not excellent
"May 14, 2012",0.5,BEST 1 FROM 12 AND 3
"May 13, 2012",4,"if youre in to star wars
this is the best movie yet, but if youre not and just like the battle scenes, its alright."
"May 13, 2012",4,Great movie one of my favorite Star Wars movies.
"May 13, 2012",5,Its STAR WARS what else needs to be said?
"May 13, 2012",3.5,wasn't the best episode i have seen
"May 13, 2012",3,"Filled with insanely glaring plotholes and errors, but high-octane action, this final entry is ACCEPTABLE, though we still deserved more."
"May 13, 2012",5,Please whoever doesn't love star wars I just don't know what to say to you.
"May 13, 2012",5,one of the best in the series
"May 13, 2012",5,im a star wars freak
"May 12, 2012",5,The best out of the prequel trilogy
"May 12, 2012",1.5,better than the rest
"May 12, 2012",2.5,Two stars just for watching Hayden Christenson burn
"May 12, 2012",4.5,Favorite new Star Wars of all time A New Hope best Star Wars classic.
"May 12, 2012",4.5,"Some ""true fans"" of the Star Wars franchise seem to hate the prequels, but they fail to understand the purpose of them. Revenge of the Sith works on so many levels. We are able to see how Anakin becomes seduced and twisted by the Dark Side of the Force, while the jedi struggle to survive. We see so much character development, in the aspects of the bond between Obi Wan and Anakin, and how they brother-like friendship changes as Anakin becomes Darth Vader. The romance between Anakin and Padme is also show so vivdly, as the heartbreak and betrayal is so intense. The action is awesome too! On the whole, Revenge of the Sith is truly the best movie in the prequels, and deserves the praise of the Star Wars fans, and this magnificent universe Lucas has created has to be appreciated."
"May 12, 2012",4,better than the previous 2...which isnt saying much
"May 12, 2012",3,"In 'Revenge of the Sith', Hayden Christensen's weird, stalker-like vibe works better than his attempt at romance last time out, as Anakin Skywalker inevitably falls to the Dark Side. A menacing supporting performance by Ian McDiarmid's Palpatine helps sell this, as does Ewan McGregor/Obi-Wan's reaction of disappointment and betrayal at his protege's turn. Some attempts to directly connect this trilogy to 'Star Wars' come off like fan service and create more questions than they answer. So... it took them, like, the better part of 20 years to build the original Death Star then, and Tarkin and Darth Vader were just up there hanging out on it the whole time? -- stuff like that. I'd have preferred more things hinted at, rather than trying to tie everything together with a neat little bow. Still, 'Sith' makes for a mostly-satisfying conclusion to the prequel trilogy."
"May 12, 2012",5,I think this is the second best of the star wars movies right behind The Empire Strikes Back.... It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time...
"May 12, 2012",5,"Best of the prequels, on a par with IV &amp; V. Awesome."
"May 11, 2012",1,i havent seen this one yet
"May 11, 2012",2.5,not such fan but not good movie
"May 11, 2012",5,"The Saga is Complete. I argued myself to find out if Revenge of the Sith is the best Star Wars movie. I still can't decide which one is better. The original or Revenge of the Sith. This movie focuses on Anakin being divided by the force turning to the dark side of it. This also causes Order 66 to go in hand. I loved this one. It got amazing at Orde 66 and it just got better and better and better as it went on and on and on. This is one movie you cannot refuse.

95/100 A"
"May 11, 2012",0.5,"worst movie i've ever watched,for a long time i wondred what is it in star wars that made it soo famous,,but every on of the 4 times i forced my self through the movie i got soo bored and made my self a sandwitch,it insults your intelligance thats why people like it,,,and i guess if you are a director of a multi-billion dollar saga,you would invest in more realistic masks"
"May 11, 2012",5,star wars???...ooh yeah
"May 10, 2012",4.5,"This movie is unfairly hated on in the geek community. Don't let the faults of Episode I &amp; II fool you, there's lots of great stuff in here, I'd even put it ahead of Return of the Jedi."
"May 10, 2012",3.5,I LIKE IT.(IT IS OKAY BUT FUN TO SEE IT MAKES ME WANT TO WATCH THE HOLE SERECES.
"May 10, 2012",3.5,Had no choice in going to see it.  I had to watch all prior episodes to understand what was going on...LOL
"May 10, 2012",3,"less Jar Jar... so it's got that goin for it. seen it more times than other movies i like a lot more. ... but it's Star Wars. I keep telling myself ""I love Star Wars"""
"May 10, 2012",3,liked the old one better
"May 10, 2012",5,"Better than The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones Return of the Jedi and making it the third best of the saga.dando a good ending to the new trilogy and a perfect start to the original"
"May 09, 2012",5,Not best in series.....but best of Prequels.
"May 09, 2012",5,"The dark part this franchise needed. The best no doubt of the prequels, and possibly one of the best of the 6."
"May 09, 2012",3,"The best Star Wars out of I, II, and III, but not even close to as good as IV, V, and VI."
"May 09, 2012",3,I wasn't paying too much attention to it when i watched it but it seemed well from what i saw.  so i'll give it afair rating for what i've seen.  but i was really sad and kinda angry with the end. :P
"May 09, 2012",4.5,"It had a couple excellent parts necessary to the Star Wars story.  To bring it all together, with good CGI and action thrown in."
"May 09, 2012",3,not George Lucas' best
"May 08, 2012",3.5,its star wars what more is there to say
"May 08, 2012",2.5,The best of the prequels (and that ain't saying much).  At least we got to see Anakin and Obi-Wan throw down and at least that was everything I hoped for and the only reason this didn't score lower.
"May 08, 2012",5,"""The force Is with you"" This movie Kicked!!!"
"May 08, 2012",5,Love Fantasy Action Movies
"May 08, 2012",4.5,star wars remake.. but its a good modified version
"May 08, 2012",4.5,did good stuff to end SW but was a lil corny and melodramatic
"May 08, 2012",5,"i love this movie, although the ending was a bit sad and harcsh... but there were a lot of firey scenes"
"May 07, 2012",5,The saga is now complete
"May 07, 2012",2.5,i'm tired of seeing this with my little brother
"May 07, 2012",3.5,Come on... this one wasn't that bad
"May 07, 2012",3.5,"Well, the Red Letter Media's review says it all, but anyway, it's still a very entertaining movie."
"May 07, 2012",5,"I don't care what people say, I love this movie!"
"May 07, 2012",3,"GOOD MOVIE,ALTHOUGH IM NOT INTO STAR WARS THAT MUCH."
"May 07, 2012",4.5,Any Star Wars is good
"May 07, 2012",5,FREEKIN SWEET! come on. if you dont love star wars ur just a treky
"May 07, 2012",4.5,Love it. I am indeed a Starwars fan
"May 07, 2012",4,shame its de last one!
"May 07, 2012",1.5,"Um, Not a big fan of star wars, it's okay."
"May 07, 2012",3,It's been so long since I have seen this one!
"May 06, 2012",3.5,Good tie in with the rest of the story but depressing.
"May 06, 2012",2,Not a Star Wars fan.
"May 06, 2012",5,star wars. hahhahahahhah
"May 06, 2012",5,"Good in all aspects, just gets a little long.  It's as good as a Star Wars could be, let's put it that way."
"May 06, 2012",3.5,the best action movie ever!
"May 06, 2012",4.5,padme kinda scared me with the brushing of hair and staring....and where in the hell did luke and leia come from with the staring and thinking?
"May 06, 2012",5,plus 5 million more stars
"May 06, 2012",5,Have it and adored it cause Hayden Christensen is in it.
"May 05, 2012",5,I love the Darknes and action in this and the romance
"May 05, 2012",4.5,2 words: Spec-Taculer
"May 05, 2012",2,"Srry, not a Star Wars fan..."
"May 05, 2012",2,I want my money back.
"May 05, 2012",2.5,"I'm a major Star Wars fan.  This could've made up for the other two, but it doesn't really.  Better than the other prequels, but that's like being the King of the Hill on a pile of manure."
"May 05, 2012",5,Star Wars enough said!
"May 05, 2012",3.5,GOOD - DARTH WAS A LITTLE CHEESY
"May 05, 2012",4,review based on enjoyment.
"May 05, 2012",2.5,"On it's own, it would be a 4. As is... just not as good as the originals. And the Darth Vader ""NOOOOOO!"" ruined it."
"May 04, 2012",4,I'ts a good movie but too long
"May 04, 2012",4.5,George Lucas is a genius
"May 04, 2012",5,Star Wars yes I'm a geek but we number in the Millions
"May 04, 2012",1,My little brother made me watch it too much
"May 04, 2012",4.5,Better graphics than the others and more action
"May 04, 2012",3,"On sent que les épisodes montent en puissance. La métamorphose d'Anakin Skywalker en Dark Vador, c'est comme Mastercard, ça n'a pas de prix. L'épisode le plus noir de la saga."
"May 04, 2012",5,best movie ever in life!!!
"May 03, 2012",3,"I love star wars, but the old ones are better."
"May 03, 2012",4,"yes,  i  saw  it,  it  was  good,  i   have  them  all"
"May 03, 2012",3.5,"Best of the three in this series; the final battle could be watched over and over again.  However, the story-line was broken, too fast, and still lacked sufficient character development.  Lucas tried to tie-up too many lose ends which greatly affected the plot.  It's fine to leave some ""t""'s uncrossed, George; we do have SOME imagination ..."
"May 03, 2012",3.5,"The best out of the first three episodes. There wasn't as much action as I thought there was going to be, but the story was excellent."
"May 03, 2012",0.5,"No thank you, this was a faff with pretty lights and an annoying cast - minus Ewan McGregor."
"May 03, 2012",4,"Easily a pioneer for future movies using CGI, Episode III can be named as the best of the prequel trilogy. It may have similar weaknesses of its predecessor, but the film overcomes itself by the audience knowing that tradgedy must occur in order for the original films to take place. An excellently put-together film that shows that good-old Georgie has a few better tricks up his sleeve."
"May 03, 2012",3.5,The best of the prequels.
"May 03, 2012",4,i  love seeing the birth of a legend
"May 03, 2012",0.5,"Crap, need I say more. You want Star Wars? Go back to 1977."
"May 02, 2012",3,"I thought it was a good movie, but I didn't like some of the scenes"
"May 02, 2012",5,this was the best movie i've ever seen (not really lol)
"May 02, 2012",3,Best of the new trilogy
"May 02, 2012",5,I cryed cause of what he did
"May 02, 2012",1.5,not a huge fan of starwars
"May 02, 2012",4,Didnt get it but I loved it
"May 02, 2012",2.5,"Though it's always a pleasure to see any of the films from the Star Wars saga, and taking for granted the six films are simply great; this one is probably the worst. Despite the -always good- visual effects,the original characters and all those things that make Star Wars so particular; the storyline is just acceptable. The romance between Anakin and Amidala is boring and the whole film turns to be the most negative and depressive film from the saga. 
It could be traumatic for a fun, watching all those great jedis dying that easy. I never thought the film would end that way, I expected something less painful.
To sum up, a great disappointment."
"May 02, 2012",2.5,"The sad, pathetic Star Wars Prequel saga finally concludes with Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.  It's what we've all been waiting for; Anakin Skywalker turns to the Dark Side, becoming Dark Vader, and proceeds to lead an attack against the Jedi.  The acting is still awful, as are the script and the special effects.  Lucas again shows his completely ignorance of the original Star Wars films, and commits some major continuity errors.  That said, this is the most action pack film of the series and delivers some spectacular lightsaber battles.  While Episode III - Revenge of the Sith has its moments and is fairly entertaining, it's another disappointing chapter in a supposedly epic sage."
"May 02, 2012",3.5,"The best of the new trilogy, but can't hold a candle to the originals."
"May 01, 2012",3.5,top movie i am a star wars fanatic so this is no suprise
"May 01, 2012",4,"Great action, interesting. So was Anakin... ^-^"
"May 01, 2012",4,Liked all the Star Wars movies
"May 01, 2012",4,Could have been better but still....AMAZING
"May 01, 2012",3.5,The best of the prequels.
"May 01, 2012",4,what can i say just love the STAR WARS
"May 01, 2012",2.5,not really my thing but .. yeah
"May 01, 2012",5,hell ya that was the best one
"Apr 30, 2012",5,best movie ever made
"Apr 30, 2012",4.5,Hard to mess up a Star Wars Movie...Unless you put Ewoks in it.
"Apr 30, 2012",2,id say it was okay though i like the ones before it
"Apr 30, 2012",3,I prefer the original 3 star wars movies
"Apr 30, 2012",2.5,It's really cheesey.
"Apr 30, 2012",5,I'll take Darth V. any day.
"Apr 30, 2012",0.5,"If I could give Negative Stars, I would. ""Revenge of the Sith"" is a picture that kills ""Star Wars"", both as a canonical universe, and a film series. ""Episode III"" is a film that was loved and accepted by crtics, undoubtedly overjoyed by knowing it was all finally over. Sequenced into dull, boring scenes of people talking in rooms and Jedi fighting in overblown CGI, the film goes too far by taking a Sci-Fi/Fantasy Adventure series into the realm of needless, violent child murder. With a director convinced he must make the film darker and more bleak than it ever needed to be, the final film in the series hurts to watch, and to recall. 

Truly, the Coup de Grace of the Prequil Trilogy (and yes, that is an insult), the film fails for two reasons above all else: Emotion Investment by the viewer, and an understanding of the main character in a series that is primarily a ""Character Study"". A perfect failure in every right, avoid it like the plague, and burn it on sight."
"Apr 30, 2012",5,"A+

The best in the series. The end scene was perfectly done. Just well rehearsed sword fighting no sped up motions or altered effects. The best movie in the series delivers on every level."
"Apr 29, 2012",3.5,I'm not a huge star wars fan.
"Apr 29, 2012",2.5,"this movie was ok, but was a cliffhanger ending!"
"Apr 29, 2012",5,i love the hole saga
"Apr 29, 2012",3,and a bit boring compared to its predecessors that are more exciting.
"Apr 29, 2012",5,Best one out of the Prequals.
"Apr 29, 2012",1.5,that movie is a bit overdraumatic at some point i don't think they're the greatest actors.

"Apr 29, 2012",5,"Loved it. I've gotta confess that the best part of this movie was megga hottie Hayden Christensen. His lack of acting skills in this movie were greatly made up for by his incredible evil attractiveness. Loved the action and amazing computer effects. George Lucas is a genius, he fit this last prequel into the older movies very well."
"Apr 29, 2012",4.5,sucker for everything starwars
"Apr 28, 2012",5,It's the best Star Wars movie!
"Apr 28, 2012",1,Better than the other new ones.  That's not saying much.

"Apr 28, 2012",3.5,way out of control on the love story - did enjoy the movie - it was the best of the recent 3.
"Apr 28, 2012",4,The best of the prequel trilogy but inferior to the original trilogy films
"Apr 28, 2012",3.5,I'm not really into star wars.
"Apr 28, 2012",5,"Don't under estimate my power!
No anakan, don't try it! 
Swoosh zoom peeeooww
Arrrghhhh 
You were my brother anakan , I loved you!
I hate you!!!
:(

Awesome film , but why on earth is chewbacca friends with yoda? Chewy is best friends with Han solo who doesn't even believe in the force...like chewy never told Han about being on first name terms with the most powerful Jedi master? Wtf?!!! Took me years of counsiling to deal with that....does not compute. Oh right it's just a movie and no one cares  ;("

"Apr 26, 2012",5,great! seen it in theater 3 times
"Apr 26, 2012",2,"Why did Anakin and Obi-Wan's fight have to be so long. We get it, they're mad at each other, and Anakin's all evil now, and Obi-Wan beats him. Did it need to be such a huge chunk of the movie?"
"Apr 25, 2012",1.5,it was a little boring

"Apr 25, 2012",2.5,"Saw it, the only Star Wars movie I have seen, it was cool"

"Apr 23, 2012",4,I liked this one. I just think it could have been longer.
"Apr 23, 2012",4,"An awesome science fiction ride, with its amazing special effects and the history its created, its hard not to be enthralled."

"Apr 22, 2012",3.5,Nice portrayal of Aniken's transition from the light to the dark.  Too much was fit into the movie though
"Apr 22, 2012",5,Love Star Wars movies
"Apr 22, 2012",1.5,"Terrible acting... It feels as if I were watching soap-operas at times...

""You're Beautiful""
""Maybe I'm beautiful because I'm in love...""

Wow... And you can still tell that the CGI are exactly that. A horrible fast turn over rate for Anakin's turn to the dark side. It's almost instantanious. 

George Lucas, stop making movies... you're ruining the franchise to make yourself a buck or two."
"Apr 22, 2012",1,not as good as the originals
"Apr 22, 2012",4,never seen it and heard it was good
"Apr 22, 2012",3,"I like that it showed the outcome of what started the whole trilogy. Its mythology is what reminded me of the 4th, 5th and 6th films. It's not as fun or adventurous as the others but it is engaging and it does have a level of sadism. This is Star Wars at its most darkest. We don't get to hear, for the most part, Anakin and Padme's 13-year old dialogue but when it does, it's cringe-worthy. The first hour, is kind of like the battle in Attack of the Clones so it does start off with a bang. The second hour, is not so much ""happy-jolly."" Its sad but it drags because Christiensen is such a bad actor (he tries too hard) and George Lucas' script doesn't even help one single bit. When Anakin screams, ""I HATE YOU!"" it almost sounds like an 8 year old who can't get what he wants. The only good performer is Mr. McGregor who does an excellent job as Obi-Wan Kanobi. He has this fatherly-mentor persona but he doesn't act like the good dog on the leash either. Overall, it's darker and more mature than any of the first two movies (this decade). 
65%"
"Apr 22, 2012",3.5,WAS BETTER THAN THE REST!!!!
"Apr 22, 2012",3,"I like all the Star Wars movies, but honestly I don't really remember this one.  Guess I'm going to have to watch it again."
"Apr 22, 2012",4,Ok I'm looking like a really big Nerd right now...Do we have to put all the nerdy movies at the begining? PS Loved it!
"Apr 22, 2012",4,My favorite of the new trilogy. Christensen's acting improved a bit. The final dual between Anikan and Obi-Wan was amazing and the overall dark overtone of the entire movie was very well done.
"Apr 22, 2012",4.5,The best Star Wars movie
"Apr 22, 2012",3,"Action is everywhere, first glimpse of Darth Vader is memorable. 3/5"
"Apr 22, 2012",3,"""your breaken my heart"""

"Apr 21, 2012",5,Who doesn't like Star Wars?
"Apr 21, 2012",5,MAY THE FORCE BE WITH US
"Apr 21, 2012",5,best and darkest film in the star wars series and franchise!
"Apr 21, 2012",3.5,"The first two Star Wars prequels are awful movies, there is no doubt about that. So how is the third and final Star Wars prequel? In short: Good... surprisingly. George Lucas managed to pull out all the stops in his final prequel, and it pays off.   The plot takes place several years after Episode 2, the clone wars are now in full swing and the whole galaxy is torn apart by it. In the middle of all this, Anakin Skywalker is having his loyalty tested as his mentor Palpatine and the Jedi are at each others throats, and he is caught in the middle. Soon, he will discover a devastating secret which will ensure his transformation into Darth Vader. I have to admit, the story is actually really good. You know that most of these characters are going to die, but you don't know when. So it's really enjoyable to watch these characters march towards their doom.   The acting is sort of a mixed bag, Ewan McGregor is perfect as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but Hayden Christensen as Anakin... he was AWFUL.  It doesn't help that the script is also weak, while Obi-Wan's dialogue is well written, witty, and in some parts funny, Anakin's is sloppy and embarrassing. And as for Natalie Portman's dialogue.... fuck, it is shit as well.   The stars of Revenge Of The Sith are the action sequences and the special effects, both of which have taken massive leaps forward since episode 2. The action scenes are well shot, beautifully filmed, and they look spectacular. Say what you want about George Lucas but he does know how to direct action.   Star Wars Episode III is a welcome addition to the Star Wars saga and despite its problems, is a redemption for George Lucas after the clusterfucks that were the first two Star Wars prequels. I say go check this one out."
"Apr 21, 2012",5,thats a good one my family is in to star wars
"Apr 21, 2012",5,I love all the SW movies

Star Wars Review
Episode III: Revenge of the Sith
Great! The first two prequels were watchable, and this film proved to be superior to them. First off, not enough obviously fake green-screens to take me out of the moment. Still one or two, but enough believable ones to make me absolve them of that sin. It lets you appreciate the scope of the CGI scenery, even if it lacks the heart the original and sequel trilogy had with practical sets. Next is that we get more action. We open right up with the battle over Coruscant. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) lead a group of clone pilots (all clones played by Temuera Morrison throughout) to rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and General Grievous (Matthew Wood). The first twenty minutes of Revenge of the Sith is actually an exciting, occasionally humorous, rescue mission that begin the final stages of Anakin's turn to the dark side. If you watched the character in The Clone Wars TV show, then it enhances the experience, but is not absolutely necessary. After saving the Chancellor and finally getting the war to wind down while the story slows down. Anakin gets the bombshell reveal that his secret wife Padme (Natalie Portman) is pregnant, and what follows is a solid half-hour of sluggish talking scenes that could have been either punctuated with more visual action or mostly, if not completely cut out without ruining the plot's coherence. What follows is Anakin's final turn to the dark side and the tragedy that Obi-Wan described in A New Hope. There are a few moments you will have to chalk up to ""the force"" or mild error in clarity. Character development comes to a full head, and if you haven't watched The Clone Wars series, it kind of sinks in, but is enhanced by said show. Padme is benched by her pregnancy, only showing up to be the one Palpatine uses against him to scare him into the dark side, as well as an expectant mother this time around. Anakin's desire to save her from what he thinks will be her fate is something any of us could relate to, it's something that creates instant sympathy in I would assume at least 90% of the audience could too. We've seen enough of Anakin over the course of three movies to care enough about his fate, and Star Wars is the story of the Skywalker saga. Everything in the plot comes back to his turn to the dark side, and that's fine by me. What's also fine by me in Star Wars, no matter what, is John Williams' amazing soundtrack. The choir in the music underscoring Anakin's turn to the dark side, the opera he attends with Palpatine where he learns of Darth Plagueis, the scene where he and Padme stare across Coruscant towards each other, and Battle of the Heroes deepens the humanity thanks to literal human voices, and is used only in such scenes. In other soundtrack news, the opening crawl is as spectacular as ever and the music for the opening battle is as grand as Coruscant. Revenge of the Sith strikes back against the first two prequels with a poetic, albeit poorly-paced, conclusion to the prequel trilogy. 
October 5, 2013
A long time ago, in 1977, George Lucas released the movie that started the greatest saga of all time. Then in 1999, he tainted its record, and in 2002, really tryed to dig Star Wars' grave. While true, Revenge of the Sith is not perfect, and has the dull, monotone Hayden Christianson, I'd like to say he finally put more authentic emotion onto Anakin. And I'm proud to say I can say that. The first third or so is dull, but the other two-thirds bring redemption to the Star Wars saga (which is ironic, because this movie chronicles the darkest events in the Star Wars Universe: more falling than redeeming). It proves that there can always be good in badness. Hayden Christianson redeems the dull romance of Episode II in this one. If I told you, I'd be spoiling it. It also raises questions about right and wrong, and shows how easily one can become the very thing they vowed to destroy if they aren't careful. I will warn you that there are more ""intense"" and ""disturbing"" images in this one, hence the PG-13 rating. Overall, my favorite chapter in the Star Wars saga for its more authentic emotional stakes than I and II. May the force guid JJ Abrams in Episode VII. 
May 12. 2012
After 7 years, Star Wars Episode III remains my all time favorite movie.  There are great effects, and likable characters.  There is also a grand plot, as well as some twists along the way.  Some say that story-telling is no longer considered for the prequels, I say that's a lie, because there is a great story in this movie.  Finally, it's Star Wars, so that's why it's my all time favorite movie."
"Apr 20, 2012",3,The finale to the most disappointing trilogy ever made.
"Apr 20, 2012",2,Let up on the Star Wars people

"Apr 18, 2012",0.5,not too bad i dont guess.but im not a HUGE star wars fan..too many of them!
"Apr 18, 2012",4.5,"My favorite of the prequel Star Wars.  I thought it was excellent except you didn't see JarJar die and George Lucas and his crappy scripting writing (duh!).  Loved the music, loved the action.  Not so much the acting."

"Apr 17, 2012",4,"Some dumb dialogue, but if you have seen ANY Star Wars you must see this one. The turning of Annakin to the Dark Side is worth all the cheezy philosophy and corny talking especially between Annakin and his love interest. Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine is chillling."
"Apr 16, 2012",5,love it because i love star wars..best one of the series
"Apr 16, 2012",4.5,Best of all star wars!

"Apr 16, 2012",5,oh i love anikan sykwalker. darth varder is my  idol!! the whole dark side thing well is hott.
"Apr 16, 2012",5,"I loved this movie, despite what all the Star Wars purists say. It finally gives us the reason(s) why and when Anakin turned to the Dark Side and became Darth Vader. You cannot help but feel the excitment when you first hear the breathing through the mask! Awesome!"
"Apr 16, 2012",4.5,"It's true that Anakin is not exactly a great actor. However, this is still my favorite Star Wars movie. It has the best action scenes and the most emotionally compelling story of all six. It has some corny parts, but not nearly as much as Episode 2."
"Apr 16, 2012",4,"Pretty cool. Annoying how the story's been told, but, can't change the past...even if it seems in some form or another George did ^_^"

"Apr 15, 2012",5,Really like the first 3 but I was upset when they changed the ghost at the end of the 6th one.
"Apr 15, 2012",5,G. Lucas is the shit!!!
"Apr 15, 2012",3,best of the newest pics
"Apr 15, 2012",3,It had to be made; I had to see it. Not as good as IV through VI.
"Apr 15, 2012",3.5,"the best prequel out of all of them unfortunately thats not saying much if you like star wars all the movie comes as basically no surprise to you good movie but falls short of the ""original"" 3"

"Apr 14, 2012",4,"Hayden Christensen is the definition of wooden, but the story holds up.Gotta love the action in this movie too"
"Apr 14, 2012",3,"Again, Leave out the lovey dovey.  Made me want to see A New Hope right away, which a feat for Lucas."
"Apr 14, 2012",5,cant go wrong with star wars
"Apr 14, 2012",5,Hayden Christian is Hott!
"Apr 13, 2012",4,"Wow, George Lucas really redeemed himself with Revenge of the Sith. After two somewhat good movies, the Star Wars Saga makes a deserving and amazing conclusion to the series."
"Apr 13, 2012",4,"Cool fight scenes and easily the best of the prequel tilogy, but the dialogue is horid."
"Apr 13, 2012",2.5,This is a good movie to see with your guy friends
"Apr 13, 2012",5,"The best installment of the new trilogy,"
"Apr 13, 2012",5,"Though poorly scripted and acted, still part of a very important franchise...and really not that bad."
"Apr 13, 2012",2,"kewl special effects,but nerdie"
"Apr 13, 2012",0.5,i hate star wars!!!!! hate despise other hate words
"Apr 13, 2012",5,LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Apr 13, 2012",5,didnt get to into the story until the end
"Apr 13, 2012",4,"Good movie, accomplished its goals, but bad acting in spots."
"Apr 13, 2012",3.5,close to getting back to why everyone loved the original trilogy...
"Apr 12, 2012",4,That's all I needed to see.
"Apr 12, 2012",4,wraps up the epic prequel trilogy neatly. intense end fight as well
"Apr 12, 2012",3,Pretty good not a huge star wars fan
"Apr 12, 2012",4.5,Bad diologe at the end but I'm a Starwars nerd
"Apr 12, 2012",5,That was the best movie i've ever watched.
"Apr 12, 2012",0.5,the best in a shitty trilogy
"Apr 12, 2012",4,"Not being a huge fan of the Star Wars series when it premiered in 2005, I wasn't sure what to expect. Thankfully, I really enjoyed this one.  I thought it was just about perfect...when I was 15 of course. I see now that Revenge of the Sith is really almost as flawed as Phantom and Clones, but there's so much exciting action surrounding everything that it's harder to pick out.  That being said, it's a fun watch and is really the only film worth watching in the prequel saga. 
I hated hated hated the special effects in Episode 2. Nothing looked real; everything was so painfully obviously CGI.  This film is a marked improvement in that area. The visual effects are flat out stunning and basically carry the movie on it's aching back. 
You know what else I hated about Episode 2? The horrible acting and dialogue. While the dialogue is horrendous in some areas, the acting is much, much better on the whole.  
I really get into this one because things build and build and the action is just non-stop. I get chills watching certain scenes (you know, when I'm not cringing).  Thematically, it gets pretty heavy, and I really feel it. 
But all these improvements aren't enough to make up for the fact that Anakin is an idiot. This nearly kills the whole mythology.  He makes the stupidest decisions I've ever seen a film protagonist make, and he falls to the dark side much too easily. And Darth Sideous makes me laugh out loud more than it should. 
Overall, I think it's a pretty good film.  Flawed, yes, but not nearly as flawed as the prequels that came before it. I'd frankly suggest just skipping over them and just watching this one if you haven't seen them yet."
"Apr 12, 2012",0.5,"Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but possibly the worst character writing I've ever seen in a movie. ""Annie"" turns into Vader because he's a complete idiot who can't think for himself. The saga was far better off without us knowing that."
"Apr 12, 2012",3.5,One of the better Star wars movies.
"Apr 12, 2012",3,the acting SUCKED! (well ok so anikan was the only one that sucked)
"Apr 12, 2012",5,great ending to a great saga
"Apr 12, 2012",3,i dont like star wars
"Apr 12, 2012",0.5,oh dear god make these movies go away
"Apr 12, 2012",5,GOOD SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Apr 12, 2012",3,You seen one you seen them all.
"Apr 12, 2012",5,"well done, but I hate StarWars"
"Apr 12, 2012",4,A good bridge between the first trilogy and the second.
"Apr 12, 2012",4,not the BIGGEST star wars fan
"Apr 12, 2012",3,the prequels were tiring...although not as bad as part one. Nice to see evil taking over...
"Apr 12, 2012",4,Nice to see the creatation of Darth Vader. Would have liked someone else to do the script.
"Apr 12, 2012",3,Melodrama at it's most convoluted.
"Apr 12, 2012",5,also on my top 6 fav. movies. really good fight scenes !!!
"Apr 12, 2012",4,"great ""tie-in"" movie for the other five films"
"Apr 12, 2012",4,"A great finale except for a few loose ends that left me wondering ""why."""
"Apr 11, 2012",3.5,It was exciting to finally see the whole trilogy!!! Pretty good not great.
"Apr 11, 2012",4,"I like this movie the same way I like X-Men 3. Yea it has problems and some dumb moments. But I still enjoyed it because this is when everything starts to go down and Anakin is becoming Darth Vader. Now I know Lucas is known for his over-use of CGI, but I actually like the CGI work in this movie. Is it better than the other prequels? Yea, you can say that. Is it better than the original trilogy? No. But being a big Star Wars fan I believe it's still worth watching."
"Apr 11, 2012",1,The story was poorly told nad just jumps into what seems to be the ending yet somehow still manages to drag. altogether it just makes me sad
"Apr 11, 2012",5,2ND BEST STAR WARS NEXT TO EMPIRE
"Apr 11, 2012",1.5,use to be a big fan of star wars but not anymore
"Apr 11, 2012",3.5,"Kind of dark, special effects were good."
"Apr 11, 2012",4.5,anikin is sooo hot.. lol
"Apr 11, 2012",4.5,The best of the prequels. Despite wooden acting and questionable casting choices ...seeing Darth Vader rise still gives me goosebumps.
"Apr 11, 2012",1,"same as all the other Star Wars, nothing special, i feel asleep"
"Apr 11, 2012",1,Never got into star wars Sorry!
"Apr 11, 2012",4,star wars is a good movie series
"Apr 11, 2012",5,"I know this movie is older than dirt, but the Special effects are almost unmatched in Hollywood.."
"Apr 11, 2012",5,may the force be w/ u
"Apr 11, 2012",4,Good movie but not as good as Star Wars 1 and 2
"Apr 11, 2012",5,"though it cant be compared to the original 3, i loved finally seeing the origin of darth vader"
"Apr 11, 2012",5,Ties up everything neatly.
"Apr 11, 2012",2.5,not too good of a movie
"Apr 11, 2012",3,"I love astronomy, and anything to do with something that isn't on this earth intrigues me."

"Apr 09, 2012",3,This film could of been legendary. If only the two previous films and poor Hayden's acting weren't seduced by the dark (and crap) side of the Force...
