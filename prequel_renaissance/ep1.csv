9h ago,3.5,"Far removed from the original trilogy, but an interesting stepping stone in the story of the Skywalker family."
18h ago,3.5,"The plot is a bit childish, but it shows us a true origin, which, however criticized it may be, fulfills the fact that it shows us the bases of the events of the galactic empire, and the origin of the Jedi knights, however criticized it is the origin of great adventures. that are to come."
1d ago,3.5,Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul are probably the best characters in this episode.
"Apr 16, 2021",1.5,"A boring mess with awful writing, awful acting and awful special effects so I'd have to say that overall it's a pretty awful movie."
"Apr 15, 2021",3,"The first time I watched it, I liked it. It has some flaws. But when I rewatched when I was older a lot of stuff bothered me. Young Anikan was very cringy, they spent to much time on Tatoine. The movie was Meh at best but this is not a good way to start watching Star Wars."
"Apr 15, 2021",3.5,"Yes the first chapter has some flaws, from the story to the cast choises, but it still is a enjoyable star wars story with some great action sequences."
"Apr 11, 2021",4,"Not bad by any means. Really doesn't deserve the hate that it gets. Solid plot, great action, and awesome characters... excluding Jar Jar. Definitely a good Star Wars movie."
"Apr 10, 2021",5,A guilty pleasure. Call me crazy but I love the prequels.
"Apr 07, 2021",1,"Everything wrong with Star Wars condensed into this film. Terrible plot, acting, characters, screenplay, costumes, genre. The whole thing is yet more Star Wars trash. Hard to sit through but I promised myself I would endure all these films so the marathon goes on. Four down. God this is painful."
"Apr 07, 2021",2.5,"I'm mixed on this one. It does have its fair share of problems. The dialogue, acting, overly political plot and jar jar binks. But the music, and special effects are out of this world for 1999. If you're here for a political drama with action, you might enjoy this alot. But if you're here for star wars, there isn't much compared to the original trilogy."
"Apr 06, 2021",4,"Here we go, I'll be one of the few to applaud The Phantom Menace. Being one of the hardcore Star Wars fans that loved the film, it shouldn't take long on my review. In 1999 I would say the first step to accepting Episode I is completely throwing out everything you knew and loved about the original 3 films. The prequel trilogy is a different tone. We waited for this film for 16 years, and I personally sat in line for 18 hours for it. What George Lucas did with the prequels, the major expansion of the Star Wars universe, in film, is finally being recognized and appreciated. In my opinion The Phantom Menace is the strongest and most confident of the 3 prequels. George Lucas DID NOT play it safe with Episode I, he attacked it, Lucas was extremely bold with this film, exactly like he was with the original film. It has the same tone, feel and emotional responses as the original. Like the original film, this is just an extremely fun escape for a few hours. Yes, the acting is a bit.......spotty.....but that is due to the fact that basically none of the actors involved with the film had NEVER done green screen, or automatic dialogue replacement........Jake Lloyd's poor performance is due to ADR.....ask a 9 year old to get in a sound booth with a microphone and vocally act out his emotions. The Phantom Menace gets a bad rap, always......and it doesn't deserve it. The expectations surrounding this film up to its release were impossible to live up to. The bad acting, dodgy writing......these were things present in even the original film, even though many fans won't admit to it. The Phantom Menace is a malor technological achievement and I'll be bold and say it's easily the best film of the prequel trilogy. Liam's Neeson just owns the movie. And for the major haters of the film.......it doesn't seem so bad now, after the Disney sequels does it?"
"Apr 03, 2021",4,This movie gets a lot of hate but I enjoyed the duel of fates scene.
"Apr 01, 2021",1.5,"Nothing makes sense, and I really mean NOTHING. But it also has Liam Neeson and Darth Maul. Extra points for that."
"Apr 01, 2021",5,"The Prequals get a lot of hate, and I don't understand why. Qui Gon? Iconic. Obi Wan? Fantastic. Darth Maul? Probably my favorite sith lord. The fight scene is just sooooo cool. He def got more development in the Clone Wars TV show, but his introduction is still great. I know people say that this movie is cheesy, but I just think its endearing."
"Mar 24, 2021",3.5,"Darth Maul (imo) should have stayed alive after his battle against Obi-Wan, just because they're hatred on each other would've continued through the different movies, and as Obi-Wan would want revenge for the death of Qui-Gon."
"Mar 23, 2021",2.5,A very disappointing movie Jar Jar Binks is just awful and a completely useless character he basically makes the film bad and there is no reason for him to be there . It's sad because Liam Neeson puts his a game into his acting and the pod race scene why was that needed??. The only good thing and a incredibly enjoyable fight with Darth Maul and he should've been in the prequals way more!!!
"Mar 22, 2021",3,"It passed the time... however they treat Maul like an action figure, and almost no one has a personality. However, JAR JAR-"
"Mar 20, 2021",5,How you like me now that you’ve seen the last 3 episodes? In comparison this is so much better. 
"Mar 19, 2021",4,"Some boring sequences though in the grand scheme are very important, horribly written dialogue and a plot structure that needed to be patched quite a bit, doesn't stop you from having a dad gum good time. Many very well crafter action sequences and some revolutionary for the time practical and visual effects. This film has aged very well especially with the generation that the prequel Star Wars trilogy was theirs."
"Mar 19, 2021",4.5,"Despite a few flaws, The Phantom Menace impressed me on my recent rewatch with a well structured story and some awesome action sequences."
"Mar 19, 2021",5,A underrated brilliant way to Start the Star wars saga as we are introduced to many beloved characters combined with great music and lightsaber battles. This film also has many layers to it with the protagonist's and antagonists and sets up ideas in the next movies.  It also has great CGI for its age.
"Mar 19, 2021",4,Solid first entry for the PT
"Mar 15, 2021",4.5,"Una película muy buena, que no pasa a sus antecesoras, pero eso no significa que sea interesante e entretenida."
"Mar 15, 2021",3,13.03.2021 ---------
"Mar 14, 2021",3,"Such a boring Star Wars film, young Anakin &amp; Jar Jar are annoying.

The lightsaber fight between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan &amp; Qui-Gon is the best in the entire franchise."
"Mar 02, 2021",5,One of my favorite Star Wars movies. Literally only bad things are Jar Jar and young Anakin(who personally I had no problem with)
"Feb 26, 2021",3.5,I liked the story line of how Anakin and Obi Wan came to be but I didn't really like the film as a whole.
"Feb 25, 2021",3.5,Not as bad as people say it is. With the brilliant Liam Neeson who sadly was not in the other films redeeming it. A nice origin story for Anakin and a brilliant sound track. Jar Jar Binks is also not as bad or annoying as people think.
"Feb 25, 2021",2,Bad movie. Jar jar sucks. Young anakin sucks. Podrace is boring. Pointless war. You can remove this movie from the trilogy and literally not miss anything. Darth Maul and Quig-on are underused. Meesa think this movie-a bad. 
"Feb 22, 2021",3.5,"Its a good movie, i just rewatched it and espacially the ending and build up for the rest of the story is better than many might think. Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul are also some of the best characters in Star Wars."
"Feb 21, 2021",4,"This is a great movie. Character development, good story, great action, and if you have young kids, a great start to the Star Wars universe. A couple plot holes and some weird moments but overall a great movie."
"Feb 20, 2021",4,"A pretty good start to the prequel trilogy. While it does have its flaws it has a lot of value and be thankful for from George Lucas. Here are my flaws, the midichlorians were something that didn't ruin the force it was something that is in al humans and is measured. jar jar is just run of the mill bad, I don't hate him like most people. My biggest flaw with the movie is that Anakin Skywalker is a Gary stew, he't too perfect, he can be a great podracer, build a droid and have a high midichlorian count. The actor who ptrays him, Jake lloyd does a bad job for what he has to do, but he's just a kid and for a child actor he does ok. the dialouge is really bad, but thats all. Now here are the pros of the movie. I think the best thing about this movie is the scenery and world building, by god it looks gorgeous, we went from these little sand planets in the originals to these gorgeous landscapes on tatooine. The actors who play the characters minus jake lloyd, do a great job with what there given. Liam neeson as qui gon jinn is one of the absoloute best performances in all of the franchise, He's subtle, stern and makes great for the character. Ewan mcgreogor as obi wan and natalie portman as padme, again do a really great job. The cgi looks pretty realistic, because it was 1999 and they were just introducing cgi which I do give george Lucas a lot of credit to. The fight at the end is splendid,with great cheoreography and showing these jedi's in there prime was great. The charatcers were great as well, Qui gon Jinn is such a great character and one of my favorites in the whole franchise along with darth maul. The score is great too and John williams best is here. while a very flawed movie, there is a lot that is overshadowed and doesn't get the credit that it deserves. A pretty good movie overall in my opionon. Phantom menace 80% B"
"Feb 20, 2021",4,"I really liked this movie. The main problem I have with the prequels is that the ending is predetermined, but seeing the journey that Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi take with the beginnings of the of the Old Republic's transformation is still worth the watch."
"Feb 15, 2021",4,Definitely doesn't deserve all the hate it gets at least its original... Better than the new Sequel Trilogy for sure.
"Feb 14, 2021",5,the best family film must watch if you have family
"Feb 12, 2021",2,pretty bad and not watchable
"Feb 09, 2021",3.5,"It may have been garbage, but it was my childhood's garbage, and there are redeeming moments like the light saber battles and pod racing, so as much as people want to put this film full in the dumpster, I won't."
"Feb 07, 2021",5,This is my childhood! Why is this hated! It is so good. Oh my gosh!
"Feb 07, 2021",3,"Probably my least favorite of the series - and Jar Jar just kills it.  A kid friendly beginning to the story, but doesn't really live up to the Star Wars name."
"Feb 02, 2021",3,"A huge drop off the original trilogy. I still like it, mind.

I do have split feelings about 'Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace' though. One positive is the casting, which is well done.

Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are strong choices to enter the franchise, I enjoyed both of them. Jake Lloyd does a fine job in his role, while the likes of Terence Stamp, Samuel L. Jackson and Keira Knightley also feature. Natalie Portman appears too, but I honestly never really cared for her lot's side of the story. Ahmed Best, meanwhile, is very hit-and-miss as Jar Jar Binks.

Speaking of Binks, the CGI is rather iffy in this fourth installment of 'Star Wars'. Of course it did come out in 1999, but other films from that era and beyond have aged better in these terms. The score is, at least, more than up to scratch.

Overall, I'm OK with this but it most definitely should've been far greater. Some scenes do go on for too long, while I did find a lack of a serious threat for the first chunk of the film. Darth Maul looks the part, but ends up being rather forgettable.

I can see how diehard fans of the series could be disappointed by this."
"Jan 30, 2021",2,"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is easily the worst Star Wars movie ever made. I cannot sit through this movie, the politics could have been good if it was done right but it wasn't, the entire plot is so convoluted and the overall story is just so bad. The best parts of this movie are definitely Darth Maul, the score by John Williams and the final Lightsaber battle. Other than that, this movie has nothing to offer for me, the performances are stiff, stale and they're all the same and Jar Jar is Jar Jar. Nothing we can do about him."
"Jan 28, 2021",2,Widzę Jar Jar Binksa i humor popsuty
"Jan 27, 2021",1.5,I honestly believe Lucas made the prequels so bad as to destroy the original trilogy.He is clearly upset by the popularity of the original trilogy that his status as a 'renegade ' film maker was ruined.
"Jan 26, 2021",5,"Darth Maul and Obi Wan Kenobi propably the best things about the movie
It's not great but if you compare it to the sequels it's fantastic"
"Jan 23, 2021",3.5,"This movie isn't bad, but it isn't good- it's OK. Look, a huge criticism of the Star Wars prequels is the acting. Yeah, you'll get bad acting with bad writing. The effects are abysmal, especially in 2021, but to be fair, it was made in 1999. It's a bit boring, but at least it's not a carbon copy of the originals. The Phantom Menace has some glaring problems, but at least it's watchable."
"Jan 22, 2021",4,Has some great moments...and some not great moments. Jar jar binks makes me want to drink heavily.
"Jan 21, 2021",2.5,Still better than The Last Jedi!
"Jan 21, 2021",3,its an ok movie with some good but jar jar binks was awful in this film but it get a 6/10
"Jan 19, 2021",3,"Its ok, the acting isn't good and Jar Jar Binks is terrible, but the lightsaber battles were awesome."
"Jan 17, 2021",3.5,"It was quite enjoyable. I heard many bad opinions about it but in my opinion it was good. Not perfect not bat. Anyways I would recommend it.

B+"
"Jan 17, 2021",4.5,"So I had never seen the prequels because my whole life I've heard from the internet that they're bad movies and that Jar Jar Binks is the worst thing ever and all that. But I decided to watch them out of curiosity. I've watched Episode I and it turns out I like it! 

Everything that had to do with lightsaber duels was great. I loved seeing Darth Maul fight Obi Wan and Qui-Gon. The podracing scene was cool and intense. It has aged surprisingly well. Overall the animation is ok, but you can tell it's 20 years old. Also, I didn't find Jar Jar annoying at all. He was even funny at times.

The lesson I learned is that you shouldn't listen to the angry mob. You should give a movie a chance and watch it yourself. They're saying the same thing about the sequels. That they're bad. But I've seen them and I liked them a lot. So I get the feeling I will like Episodes II and III as well."
"Jan 13, 2021",4,Beautiful locations as you would expect from Star Wars.  Awesome light sabre duels and entertaining characters to assist the story.  Niche in the sense that it is telling a story whose audience interest rests on movies that came before.  It would be hard to balance this movie to appeal equally to old time fans and new audience members with no prior knowledge of lore.  Its biggest challenge was likely living up to the kinds of expectations fans would have built up by the time it came out.  Criticisms against this movie have almost always seemed overly harsh to me.
"Jan 12, 2021",5,Prequels are amazing
"Jan 12, 2021",2.5,"A great achievement in technical feats such as visual effects, however everything good about the film is dragged down by the poor script and subpar acting. Amazing and creative characters such as Darth Maul are overshadowed by annoying and poor characters such as Jar Jar. The magic is there but it is overwhelmed by how the bad the film is from a movie perspective."
"Jan 12, 2021",4,"I know everyone hates on the first three Stars Wars movies, but I actually thought this was pretty good. I liked the settings- Naboo was absolutely beautiful- and don't even get me started on the queen's outfits!! Sure, the plot could have been better, but I feel like they set up a good backstory for the major trilogy."
"Jan 10, 2021",4.5,An Awesome (sort-of) beginning! The prequels are misunderstood masterpieces! Darth Maul is also REALLY cool!
"Jan 06, 2021",5,"This movie is so underrated! A few toxic Star Wars fans hated on it and before you knew it, everyone had mindlessly jumped on the bandwagon! It sets the stage for Anakin Skywalker's origin story with nuance and grace. Put some respect on its name!"
"Jan 04, 2021",3,"Although this movie does have its flaws, you have to admit when it shows us glimmers of hope, it is satisfying. Such as Ewan McGregor giving us a great performance that is awesome to watch. There are setbacks like Young Anakin who is not that great. As well as Jar Jar Binks being extremely annoying. Also, the CGI is dated in a lot of parts, but scenes like the pod racing and the climactic Duel of Fates battle may be the best scenes in the prequels. Since I grew up with the prequels, I do have a place in my heart for them. Now, rewatching them, I did not realize how many scenes I would remember. Grade 78% (C+)"
"Jan 04, 2021",2.5,"This is the kind of movie that could be described as barely fresh by some people and completely rotten by other people. I would stand with the rotten gang: Although I don't think that it is an incredibly rotten movie, I would definitely say that it is NOT fresh. I guess it is somewhat important inside the Star Wars saga, as it gives us extra back-story about Anakin and other characters, but, for me, probably the most memorable moment (and the most entertaining and fun one as well) of the movie is the final fight against Darth Maul. Everything else just feels... mediocre. I hated little Anakin's character, it is kind of slow, boring and it just isn't good enough to live up to the other Star Wars films. Ohhh, and something else... I must say, that I HATED the animation. It is just too bad. Ugly. Awful. And, now that I think about it, I didn't only hate Anakin's character. I hated Queen Amidala, The Trade Federation guys, Jar Jar, Anakin's Mother, and basically every animated character."
"Jan 02, 2021",3.5,"Over the years. I've grown to appreciate this movie. Now yes some aspects are dated, but I would still give this a watch every now and then. The Podrace and Duel of The Fates are the best scenes in the movie."
"Jan 02, 2021",3.5,"Story ok, maybe because I already know what will happen eventually, but the space battles and lightsabers are epic always"
"Jan 02, 2021",2.5,"The movie is quite amusing. Jake Lloyd is annoying, but enjoyed Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor's characters. The movie has lots of bad stuff that counteracts the good stuff. And I wish Darth Maul had a much larger role. He only has a couple of scenes. If you like Star Wars or sci-fi or cheesy acting or bad effects, than this is for you."
"Jan 01, 2021",3,"Boring at various points, acting can be better, considering the all-star cast of the film, and very strong Writer/Director.

But I have to say that this film has some of my favorite light saber duels in the entire saga.

My grade: C+"
"Dec 31, 2020",5,"6 bags, and more medichlorians than you can shake a lightsaber at. People hate on the prequels, but despite its flaws, Phantom Menace was a great triumph for Star Wars and is better than any of the Disney produced trilogy. Though it is worth the price of admission for the ""Duel of the Fates"" fight and music alone, there is a lot to love, like the awesome pod racing sequence. This installment took some big steps in expanding the Star Wars universe and overall did a great job. There's some great acting in this from Neeson, McGregor, and the kid who plays Anakin. Some people say that Anakin's acting was terrible but it just goes to show you how great of an actor he really was. That kid knew his character was destined to be Darth Vader, so he had to play him a little off and awkward. Then Hayden Christensen did an even more amazing job carrying forward the role of Anakin, modeling his own performance after the kids performance of a tragically skewed optimist in Episode 1. Meeeesa loved McGregor and Portman and Ray Park in the movie 2!"
"Dec 30, 2020",3,"This movie delivered Star Wars to a new generation of fans. It gave us glimpses into the world of the Jedi only alluded to in the prequels. The Lightsaber duels were well choreographed and brought an elegance to the Jedi's fights that was lacking in the stiff fight scenes of the originals. Ewan McGregor is a great Obi-Wan. The score is new but pays tribute to the original series. Beyond that some of the shooting from first person with the light saber scenes comes off as corny. Jar Binks is more polarizing than the Ewoks, and watching the dialect now, actually seems to be somewhat racist and offensive evoking southern stereotypes of African Americans. The plot about trade embargos is convoluted and boring. Liam Nesson and Natalie Portman give stiff performances in a script with poor dialogue. Ray Parker's Darth Maul has potential but is ultimately thrown away. The character is given proper due in the later animated series, All in all this is not a great movie and among the weaker Star Wars entries."
"Dec 30, 2020",2.5,Definitely not as bad as attack of the clones.
"Dec 28, 2020",3,"This is one of the worse Star Wars films for many reasons (thanks Jar Jar Binks). If you are watching the saga and want additional material then this is an early story that will be of interest to watch. Otherwise, you will just be treating yourself to lots of dated CGI and annoying animated character quips."
"Dec 28, 2020",2,"This movie can be boring, cartoony in the worst possible way, and cheesy beyond forgiveness. But the Darth Maul fight and John William's score make up for it a little."
"Dec 27, 2020",4.5,"I always thought this movie was fine. But after seeing it again I changed my mind a lot. I was really amazed at how good the movie actually is. That's why it gets a 4,5."
"Dec 27, 2020",4.5,"Do not understand why others would rate this one so low. I enjoy the prequels and this one is a fun and eye-opening experience. The podracing was one of a kind and the battle on Naboo, although flawed, provided an unique viewing experience. Only if they have more time to polish some of the ending scenes.."
"Dec 27, 2020",3.5,Great introduction to the Skywalker saga
"Dec 26, 2020",5,The real new hope...to how to continue the Star Wars Franchise. Darth Maul becomes a huge major new character with exciting new traits. Amazing Jedi lightsaber action just perhaps not what the audience got use to making it drop in ranks.
"Dec 25, 2020",4.5,"This is a good film adding to the Star Wars franchise. I don't know why so many people complain or dislike this movie especially comparing to the 2 Movies after.
Good plot and characters, and explores new sides of the Star Wars universe.
Overall this movie is underrated. It's a must see film"
"Dec 24, 2020",5,Despite some humor that falls a bit flat for older audiences it is still a great film. Some great words of wisdom from Qui Gon and the best light saber battle and score of the series.
"Dec 22, 2020",3,"I remember liking this much more when I saw it almost two decades ago but I guess since I still have never seen the next two, it couldn't have had that much of an effect on me. I def think there are some entertaining scenes here and for me, far from a Star Wars fan, it acts as a perfectly serviceable prequel to the original trilogy. Jar Jar definitely costs a half star at least though as he is by far the most annoying character from the Star Wars universe I have encountered. 6.5/10"
"Dec 20, 2020",1,"I haven't seen this since it was first released in the movie theaters, and I didn't think it could possibly be as bad as I remembered it. Boy, was I wrong. It was slow. Plodding. And I just wanted to strangle Jar Jar."
"Dec 17, 2020",2,"I don't fall asleep during a movie usually, but this movies was very boring. It's a must watch if you want to watch the Star Wars movies, but this movie wasn't good at all. It wasn't really bad though. My biggest problem was the dragging of the storylines."
"Dec 17, 2020",3,"I was inspired after watching the Mandarlorian and watched this movie again.  It was better than I remember, but still clearly not the best movie in the franchise.  Some characters were just too over the top."
"Dec 16, 2020",1,"If I could give movie negative 5 stars it would be too generous. 
Arguably one of the worst films in cinematic history."
"Dec 16, 2020",0.5,The worst in the SW series. Jar Jar Binks is the worst character ever. Annoying beyond words. The movie has so many cheap special effects it looks like a Playstation game.
"Dec 09, 2020",4.5,"George Lucas' creativity built a completely original story and beginning to this beloved saga. Some of the criticism you tend to hear from the toxic fans of the original trilogy attacks the politics, acting, and graphics in this movie. I completely disagree with that analysis, and here is why. We know from the most recent presidential elections that politics, whether you like it or not, draws a lot of attention and can be extremely fun to watch. As a kid I did not understand most of the politics but today I see something new every time I watch this movie and the political portions are so interesting to watch because you are seeing strings being pulled to destroy a democracy. I believe the acting was fantastic, though in some places elect emotion. Next time you re-watch this movie look at the intensity on Liam Neeson‘s face when he fights Darth Maul. He didn't make any wacky faces like most action movies, he looked like a trained master of combat fighting for the fait of the galaxy and trying to kill evil. The choreography in the fighting was great, and the originality of George Lucas gives this film tons of rewatchability because you won't find any movie like it in the years since."
"Dec 09, 2020",2,"This film is considered one of the most controversial Star Wars movies. Even though many prequel stans hate the sequels and bash them, the prequels: especially PM and AOTCS have many problems. What made the original trilogy so special was the characters: Luke, Han, Leia, Lando, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, and so many more. The Phantom Menace only has one character worth mentioning: Qui-Gon Jinn played by Liam Neeson. Everyone else is barely worth mentioning. 

One of the main problems is the sluggish plot. The Trade Federation and the politics related to that really slow down the plot and make it more convoluted. We don't even meet the protagonist of the film for quite some time. Luke was introduced to the audience fairly quickly in a New Hope. Another problem was explaining the force with science. As well as the over-abundance of terribly aged CGI. 

However, the Phantom Menace is not without merit. The final duel is pretty memorable and the soundtrack by John Williams is pretty good. The podrace scene is solid enough as well."
"Dec 08, 2020",3.5,"A great movie for begins this new trilogy star wars, i love this movie. It's very good."
"Dec 07, 2020",3,"Gostei da história e dos atores, cria uma empatia pela história. Achei a cena da corrida confusa, em poucos momentos entendi o que estava acontecendo. Mas em geral o filme e um bom passatempo."
"Dec 07, 2020",3,"Was it perfect no, but I felt it accomplished the goal of introducing the characters while giving the fans the entrainment they come to expect from Star Wars. Neeson, McGregor and Ray Park held it down with their character portrayals and lightsaber battles. Jar Jar isn't terrible quit hating on the man."
"Dec 04, 2020",5,much better than the shit sequels
"Dec 04, 2020",5,This movie is a masterpiece of cinema...In comparison to the newest Star wars BS.
"Dec 03, 2020",1.5,"a very bad movie, many things don't work and it gets to be quite tedious, without a doubt one of the worst in the saga, despite the final fight being satisfactory."
"Nov 30, 2020",4.5,This movie is not perfect as Jar Jar is in here however I will say that this movie is one of the best in the Star Wars series
"Nov 28, 2020",3,Preferred it too Attack of the Clones. But its still not great. I don't hate Jar Jar as much as a lot of other people. But this movie gets bogged down by boring expositional scenes and bland acting.
"Nov 27, 2020",3.5,"FEAR leads to Episode I. 
EPISODE I leads to HATE.
HATE leads to SUFFERING EPISODE II.
EPISODE II leads to ANGER.
ANGER leads to EPISODE III and more suffering.

Or so 'some' fans would like to claim. 
In fact Phantom Menace is a pretty decent kiddies flick. Yes its a kiddies flick first and foremost and that's absolutely fine. The originals had its lighter film with Return of the Jedi. This trilogy just goes for the reverse, as EPISODE III was always going to be a very dark film in comparison. Its the one film in the prequel trilogy where Lucas is truly at his most creative. The film has its own style and doesn't at all rely on the aesthetic or nostalgia of the original trilogy jar Jar is a bit annoying but honestly it's really not as insane bad as some would have you believe. The politics is not actually that big a part in the movie. The world building is excellent and Lufas definitely knows how create that lived in universe feel. The more personal character journeys of the originals isn't here thats for sure and fans of the original trilogy make that point.
This is a good but not great film. Certainly its a film that all Star Wars fans should appreciate and I think since the sequels finished even more so. And if you only need one reason to see this film at least once; Darts Maul. Enough said!"
"Nov 25, 2020",2,"A disappointing return to the world of Star Wars after nearly 16 years. The story drags out, has poor CGI and uninteresting characters. The plot of the movie hardly contributes to the story of Star Wars and can be skipped when watching through the saga."
"Nov 24, 2020",3,"The Phantom Menace begins the Star Wars prequel trilogy with a muddle of politics, useless and annoying characters, and a bad habit of over-exposition, but ultimately pulls itself together for an impressive final act."
"Nov 24, 2020",3.5,"Duel of the Fates was amazing, Darth Maul fight was cool, but... uhh... this wasn't exactly the best star wars film out there. Seriously though how the hell does troll world tour have higher critic reviews? What? This was much better."
"Nov 23, 2020",3.5,Some parts of the execution and the dialogue were not the best but overall I enjoyed the story.
"Nov 22, 2020",1,"This first 15 minutes of this movie is fairly high on cringe factor. For me the kid was the best bit along with the pod race. it's poorly directed and poorly written. if it wasn't for the millions of star wars fans from episode 4,5,6. it would have flopped."
"Nov 14, 2020",1.5,"Vous souvenez vous de la trilogie originale de star wars ? Une ambiance, une croyance, du développement et surtout une fascination pour cette univers ??? Et bien La Menace Fantôme brise TOUT.
Tatouine est une planète pauvre ? Un personnage va vous le rappeler avant qu'une course mondiale de Pod Racers n'ai lieu. La force est mystique ? On va briser cette croyance avec de la science. Les jedi sont sages ?? On va les faire passer pour des abrutis avec une prophétie à laquelle ils croient aveuglément et qui est la seule excuse de cette prelogie... Les acteurs jouent mal, le film est bourré de blagues forcées pour vous décrocher un sourire.. Mais ça a l'effet du pétard mouillé. Seul la fin est digne d'intérêt grâce à la superbe musique de Williams cependant, on oublie vite cette musique mythique qui contraste énormément avec un enfant qui ne cesse de dire ses pensées à voix haute et qui réussit tout sans aucune expérience ni difficulté ainsi que des moments où on a l'impression que les personnages sont en chargement comme lors du combat final et que l'antagonisme ne réagit pas à une pirouette de 7 seconde et se fait trancher en deux.. Ou pire, un élément introduit des le début du film : courir vite grâce à la force, qui n'est PLUS JAMAIS exploité dans tout l'univers de star wars (excepté la série 2D CW) et qui aurait pu résoudre pratiquement toutes les situations malencontreuses de nos amis les jedi que l'on apprend à détester avec ce film (et la suite de cette trilogie évidemment). Ormi la musique et quelques scènes, rien n'est à sauver dans ce film et il nous fait vite regretter la trilogie originale ou même la postlogie tant il est niais et remplie de contrastes (ex : moments trop enfantins avec Jar Jar et Anakin puis une séquence de politique pour adultes). 1.5/10"
"Nov 13, 2020",1.5,Getting through this movie was so painful. It was just so boring and the characters show no emotion.
"Nov 13, 2020",4,Absolutely pure of a Star Wars movie 
"Nov 12, 2020",3.5,Fantastic special effects and SOME elements of an amazing (or potentially amazing) -plot are the redeemers for an otherwise uninspired ream of crappy dialogue and the ministrations of a man who couldn't get out of his own soap-box.
"Nov 12, 2020",0.5,Absolutely horrible one of the worst movies ever made the sequel trilogy is way better.
"Nov 11, 2020",5,"Say what you want about his movie, I love the move! Its the starting story to the Skywalker bloodline. Good Movie in my books."
"Nov 08, 2020",5,"Barring the existence of Jar Jar Binks, this is a very solid Star Wars movie"
"Oct 31, 2020",3.5,"The beginning of the prequels, this movie has much less suspense and action than the first 3 star wars movie, and features a very annoying character who gets too much screen time. He wouldn't have been so bad if the original idea for the prequels went through, but people hated this character so much his major plotline was scrapped for the next two films. Now for the movie itself, it's alot of talking and useless politics but features some interesting moments. It's not as bad as people make it out to be, but it is indeed a letdown."
"Oct 26, 2020",5,One of the worst STAR WARS movies yet still awesome!
"Oct 25, 2020",2,Really boring and underwhelming
"Oct 22, 2020",3,"I can respect for what George Lucas was trying to do with the prequel series, l would have been happy with the senate meetings and the somewhat hap hazard talk about the ‘Force'  if the pacing was done right and very obviously Jar Jar Binks wasn't in the movie. Light saber duels and the Jedi council was an intresting avenue to explore."
"Oct 21, 2020",3,"The only things going for EPISODE I is the wonderful lightsaber choreography, the masterful score by John Williams and the Special Effects."
"Oct 21, 2020",3,"This was my first star wars movie, so it holds a special place in my heart. The lightsaber battle with Darth Maul was great. I liked the set designs like the underwater city and the.... place where the final battle with maul took place. The acting was ok. The pacing was bleh. It was kinda slow. There were a bit too many political scenes."
"Oct 20, 2020",1,"I find it insane that The Phantom Menace is not the worst Star Wars film in the main series. However, that doesn't mean it still isn't awful, with an over reliance on ugly and pretty dated CGI, lack of character, and horribly written story."
"Oct 18, 2020",5,"this film is actually quite good I would say I hate attack of the clones, for the most part, this is still better than the Last Jedi."
"Oct 15, 2020",3.5,The lightsaber battle makes up for the politics.
"Oct 11, 2020",4,"This movie has many flaws. But, it adds a ton to the franchise. It revived Star Wars, and has lots of awesome and memorable scenes and sequences."
"Oct 11, 2020",2.5,"The Phantom Menace's conclusion is some of the best Star Wars we have, but for the rest of the movie, it is underwhelming and too childish for a franchise about a war. Star Wars should appeal to all ages, however, this movie hits the wrong way for those that experienced the originals."
"Oct 10, 2020",2.5,Yikes. This is the same filmmaker?
"Oct 09, 2020",3,it's a good movie. but it is not bad. 6/10
"Oct 07, 2020",3.5,"What do you want from me? This movie has Darth Maul and ""Duel of the Fates."" Spare me your Jar Jar slander because he isn't terrible, and the pod race scene is excellent! Grab some popcorn and watch this on the biggest screen possible!"
"Oct 05, 2020",5,MEME master star wers
"Oct 01, 2020",4,"Great movie, I love everything in it,"
"Sep 29, 2020",3.5,"It's bold in terms of jerking people around, but i think George Lucas went to far in a few places"
"Sep 29, 2020",5,A great way to start the saga.
"Sep 28, 2020",3.5,7.0/10. this film has a fantastic cast and an awesome Lightsaber duel with Darth Maul but Jar-Jar Binx is a very annoying character and the Pod race went on a bit too long.
"Sep 16, 2020",1.5,"What previously worked beneath the surface has come into the spotlight, and it is unbelievably boring. The Phantom Menace has the most forgettable and political plot that is left unsupported by the most robotic and wooden characters that the audience is so unemotionally unattached to, the only thing protecting the film from being a completely pointless side story is Anakin's involvement."
"Sep 15, 2020",2,"Has cool lightsaber battle but overall pretty slow, tally, and boring."
"Sep 14, 2020",5,I'm a person and my name is anikan!!!!!!
"Sep 12, 2020",2,"This film fails on basically every aspect of film making, and it's so boring"
"Sep 04, 2020",0.5,"I really like Star Wars. I grew up with the original trilogy and was really excited to watch this era of Star Wars, considering I loved the Clone Wars. I was severely disappointed. This movie is as bad or worse than Attack of the Clones. The dialogue is terrible. Every line is so bland and has no character. Everyone talks the same and it's very strange. None of the characters have traits, except for Anakin and Jar Jar. Everyone constantly says that Jar Jar is the worst part of the movie, but I disagree. Jar Jar is the only character in the movie that doesn't talk like a robot. He actually makes the movie better and I actually think the movie would be worse if he wasn't in it. The plot of this movie also makes no sense. I still to this day don't completely understand the plot of this movie. For a movie whose characters only tell you exactly what is happening in the story and what they are going to do, it does a pretty bad job of helping you to understand what is going on. The only parts of this movie that don't make you feel like you're dead are pod racing and the final battle. The final battle is pretty epic, but it's not epic when you realize that you don't care about anything that is happening. This movie also has another problem. Unlike Attack of the Clones, this movie doesn't really matter. Basically nothing happens in this movie that affects the others (aside from Maul) and if you take it out of the trilogy, it changes almost nothing. Go ahead and watch it if you want to, but don't expect to be enjoying yourself very much."
"Sep 01, 2020",3.5,"Once I kicked out the ""but it's Star Wars"" philosophy from my head, I was able to come up with an accurate review of how I actually feel about this movie. Overall, my review is favorable. Young Anakin is not nearly as annoying as people say he is and the same I find to be true about Jar Jar. The score is great, the Lightsaber fights are still awesome to this day, the pod racing scene is fun, and the story is interesting. It also sets up very well for the subsequent movies. I like it."
"Aug 31, 2020",4,Anakin is the cutest boy in the galaxy.
"Aug 30, 2020",4.5,I really like this so no star wars movie ever lets me down
"Aug 30, 2020",4.5,Great start to the series from the opening to the ending. Greatly expanding the universe george created in the 70s.
"Aug 26, 2020",3,"I didn't think this film was that bad, but I did have some issues with this film though."
"Aug 17, 2020",3.5,A fun ride but at points highly irritating.
"Aug 16, 2020",3.5,"Uma experiencia divisiva, mas que me contentou no final.

Liam Neeson e Ewan McGregor estavam excelentes como personagens principais. Liam tem uma voz poderosíssima, e aqui ele faz um uso muito bom dela. Natalie Portman também faz um bom trabalho, assim como o pequeno Jake Lloyd. Samuel Jackson me ganhou só pela aparição dele.

A cena de luta final foi muito bem coreografada, que junto a uma direção muito bem feita e uma OST insanamente bem orquestrada, certamente é a melhor cena do filme. O plot da Padmé Amidala foi bom, me pegando de surpresa. As cenas de corrida foram melhores do que eu imaginava. Infelizmente, algo desceu e muito o nível do filme. E isso se chama: Jar Jar Binks.

Um alivio cômico extremamente desnecessário, fora de hora, forçado, conveniente e inconveniente. Há diversas maneiras de fazer um alivio cômico, mas destinar um personagem inteiro para isso foi uma escolha terrível. Ele mais te emburrece que é engraçado. Aposto que nem mesmo as crianças deram risada daquilo."
"Aug 08, 2020",1.5,"I honestly don't understand it when people give this movie 5/5 stars, and let alone call it ""way better than the Disney movies."" It's not. It's not better. The only good things in this movie was the music, visual effects, and the last duel with Darth Maul and the dudes with the pony tails. But other than that, this movie is boring as hell and it is dull and lifeless. I fell asleep watching it as I was halfway through the movie. At the end of the movie when the Star Wars music suddenly popped up on screen and said ""Written and Directed by George Lucas"" I actually forgot that this was a Star Wars movie that I was watching. I could go on and on talking about its flaws but my brain is too numb right now to do such a big task after watching it."
"Jul 29, 2020",3.5,"I have a fellow gen-ex friend who absolutely hated the latest trilogy and swears by the prequels as being superior. I saw the prequels when they came out and had many of the same problems with them that everyone else did. Well, I finally took the plunge and watched Ep 1 again, and I have to say I think my friend might be on to something after all. There is much more creativity here from George than he gets credit for. Clearly, he was trying to give us something new, rather than a rehashing of the original cannon (which is what JJ Abrams gave us.) Liam Neeson really carries it, providing a fine dose of charisma and depth to the Jedi mythos. The special effects hold up well for a film that's 20 years old. There is much more opera here than the so-called ""space opera"" of the original trilogy, and I for one had more patience for it as a 43 year old. The political intrigue is cluttered and redundant, and it's a miracle Jar-Jar didn't ruin the film completely, but I would have to submit that Ep 1 is well deserving in the category of underrated, and more interesting than that dumb new trilogy, which goes nowhere and only serves to satiate the fetish. Lucas might not have fully succeed in his quest to expand the SW universe, but at least he tried."
"Jul 28, 2020",2,This was like watching a high school play version of the movie someone wanted to make. What in the world. So many awful characters with annoyingly pat dialogue.
"Jul 25, 2020",4,There's plenty wrong with this movie yet I still love it. It lays the foundation for some greatest character development ever seen in the movies. The fact that Disney screwed the 'sequel trilogy' so badly helped my appreciation of this movie too.
"Jul 23, 2020",0.5,🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮😤😤😤😤 Trash
"Jul 22, 2020",2.5,"A mixed bag to begin the prequel trilogy, full of clunky writing but fun set pieces."
"Jul 20, 2020",2.5,"Watching this thing years later, I can finally say, this is not a good movie.  I liked it well enough as a kid as a charming little adventure, but as an adult it's kind of a hard watch.  I don't know that I was ever bored by anything, but it's wildly inconsistent and just not well put together.  The writing is bad, the directing is awkward, and the CGI is about on par with a PlayStation 1 cutscene, if not worse.  On top of that, it's really just not necessary.  What do we learn from this movie for the overall Star Wars mythos?  Basically how Sidious rose to the status of chancellor.  Even that is more of a background thing for all the other weird crap happening, and probably could just have been put in the opening scroll of the next film.  So it's a bad film, and at times it's pretty cringey.  But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't at times an entertaining film.  Not always for the right reasons, but it's got some fun stuff.  I still like the podracing scene, and that final fight is as good as it was back in the day with some stellar choreography.  It's got it's moments, I'll defend it a little bit, but overall it's pretty cringey and pointless."
"Jul 19, 2020",4,Great movie. Very epic
"Jul 16, 2020",3.5,"I liken this movie to a steam engine.    It takes a long time to get going to speed.  Trade disputes are a hard thing for kids to understand so forgive me for not.    Then we get up to speed and see some force stuff, light sabers, decent acting, racing, space stuff.... Star Wars.     The reason you bothered to show up.     Then this train is really speeding along with one of the best lightsaber duels and a fantastic score.      then the engineer sees a car stuck on the tracks and throws the brakes and go figure we slowest but aggressively grind to a halt leaving us waiting to get going again in the form of a giant party and the word ""PEACE!""    It's good not great as a Star Wars movie and it does set us up for round number 2.     3.5 is a very decent score for a movie that was a complete....  well gamble."
"Jul 16, 2020",1.5,"A boring misfire for poor old George. If you're watching Star Wars for the first time, feel free to skip this one."
"Jul 15, 2020",3.5,It's slow when their on tatooine but jar jar is funny he cracks me up 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Jul 15, 2020",3,"The fact that George Lucas directed all the Prequels by himself was bold. May have not been the right decision, but unlike the Sequels, it had a plan. The lightsaber duels and blaster battles were all done well, however, the film fails to present itself in such a format, often looking into politics of it all. I actually do enjoy the political side of it, it explains the fall and rise of the senate. We do move on from that planet and journey to new and old ones."
"Jul 13, 2020",2,"Annoying humor, and only a few good moments. Worst of the Star Wars saga."
"Jul 13, 2020",3,"The ending was great but everything before the last 15 or so minutes were meh to fine. The whole movie as a whole was just fine, not the worst movie in the prequel trilogy, but it isn't the best."
"Jul 11, 2020",5,"Cuando era un niño me gustaba más de la saga de Star Wars la primera parte, 
la Amenaza fantasma."
"Jul 09, 2020",3,El gran error de esta película fue la adición de Jar Jar Binks. Es un ser tan irritante y digitalmente horrible.
"Jul 09, 2020",2,"The lightsaber duel and blaster fights are well done, however, the film fails to present itself in a simplistic format, often preferring to delve into the irrelevant inter-universal politics rather than important plot points."
"Jul 06, 2020",2.5,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but Phantom Menace is the worst of the series. Jar Jar Binks ruins it, and the film can be very boring at times. The only thing that saves this movie is the Duel of the Fates and the Podracing scene."
"Jul 06, 2020",5,Good soldiers follow orders
"Jul 06, 2020",2.5,Fight scene was dope but overall pretty boring
"Jul 06, 2020",2,"It is as boring as they say, but still an essential part of Anakin's journey."
"Jul 04, 2020",1.5,"A mix of good and bad actors, terrible comic relief a fairly boring story (especially the LONG time on Tatooine). It starts to make me question if we needed prequels."
"Jun 20, 2020",4,"The Phantom Menace isn't perfect but seeing how the new disney movies turned out I thoroughly appreciate the prequels more. There is still a lot of good in Phantom besides the sometimes awful dialogue and acting. The character of Qui-Gon Jiinn, Mace Windu and Darth Maul are fine editions to the saga. The world building and cinematography feel new and has another feeling compared to the original trilogy.
I enjoy a big portion of The Phantom Menace and respect the movie."
"Jun 20, 2020",3,I didn't mind this movie but I did have some issues with it though.
"Jun 18, 2020",3.5,"As someone who grew up watching the prequels as well as the OT, i loved all six movies. Now as I've grown up i understand the issues with it such as the politics, midichlorian and Jake Lloyd's Anakin, but i still enjoy the action with Maul and John William's score."
"Jun 16, 2020",1,Just a bad movie the hype for this movie was surreal and it didn't live up. Just horrible
"Jun 14, 2020",4.5,The Senator has decided to give this movie a 4.5/5 star rating.
"Jun 14, 2020",3.5,"While Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is disappointing, it has extremely strong points. The Qui Gon Jinn-Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul fight is most likely the best lightsaber duel in the entire Skywalker Saga. The acting is mostly good in this movie, while the writing is sub-par as usual for the prequel films. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor put up very strong performances. And of course, we must adress the Jar Jar problem. Obviously, Jar Jar Binks is basically thrown into the movie to be comic relief for little kids, and it even fails at that. But if you really tune him out and sometimes the annoyance of young Anakin, this is a well rounded Star Wars movie that I think is underrated and trashed for the sole fact of Jar Jar Binks."
"Jun 11, 2020",2.5,"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace Review: 5/10

Pros:

The Darth Maul lightsaber battle

Pod-racing

Liam Nesson and Ewan McGregor are awesome as Jedi

Cons:

Sometimes this movie is boring af

Jar Jar Binks

Way too long. Would be an excellent 2 hour movie (but it's 2.5+)"
"Jun 11, 2020",1,"On my seventh watch through, I finally understood the plot. Maybe I'm just stupid, but this film is marketed at 7-12 year olds according to George Lucas. Name one 7-12 year old who wants to watch a film about the trade federation taxing trade routes. The dialogue is terrible - even in a galaxy far far away, no one speaks like that. People complain about Jar Jar Binks, but, if I'm honest, he is one of the only parts that make this film bearable. It is slow and boring, except for the last quarter, where something actually happens, but I don't care about the characters enough to be rooting for them. The actors did the best they could with the awful script (especially Liam Neeson), but it wasn't enough to save this disaster of a film. Darth Maul was killed, and should not have been (yes, I know he survives in the Clone Wars), but if he was alive, it might have made Attack of the Clones better, with Obi Wan having previously known Darth Maul and hating him for killing Liam Neeson, instead of Count Dooku, the most unneeded character ever, but that's criticism for the sequel I guess. In conclusion, bad film, don't watch it, it has barely any relevance to the rest of the franchise. Oh, also, the flirting between a teenage Padme and young child Anakin is weird. The only reason why it has a star is because of the acting."
"Jun 07, 2020",2,"The Phantom Menace is not a very good movie. The acting isn't very good, the plot isn't very good. I do not know why Lucas started this trilogy out by showing us Anakin as a 10 year old. And Anakin as a kid is very annoying. And then there's Jar Jar. I know he is for kids but they shove him in every scene and he is so annoying. Like everyone said he was annoying and I thought people were being dramatic but they aren't. He is really annoying. And the love connection they kinda set up with Padme and Anakin is kinda weird because he is like 10. The only good thing in this movie is Darth Maul and he gets cut in half. The pod race isn't bad either but this movie isn't very good"
"Jun 05, 2020",2,One of the most boring Star Wars movies! This movie is quite boring. If isn't without the action... well it's not worth watching. This whole movie is around Politics more than usal! I dislike Politics and that's why it bored me. There's two epic battles(space/land) that I enjoyed watching. I think this movie is one of the poorer Star Wars movies(out of 9 in the saga). I give this 35% Rotten Tomatoes!
"Jun 05, 2020",2.5,"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is a rough start for the prequel trilogy. For every good new character introduced, there is an annoying character, especially Jar Jar Binks, who is cringe-worthy in every scene at best. The action can be clunky and uninteresting but it has it's moments, such as the Pod Racer sequence."
"Jun 05, 2020",4,Great movie but a little childish. Overall a great introduction.
"Jun 03, 2020",4,"Even though this film is wildly hated due to the poor CGI, mediocre acting, and annoying characters (Jar Jar), it still gives way to one of the best Star Wars eras. It also creates a whole new lore and world and includes some of the best moments in Star Wars history."
"Jun 03, 2020",3.5,"I remember really loving this movie as a kid, but when i revisit it now, it is just good. Nothing really stands out to me for being amazing. There isn't a lot of action, so it is pretty slow paced. The Pod-Racing scene is very fun and entertaining, the Lightsaber-Battles are very well choreographed and some of the acting was great too. Overall pretty good."
"Jun 03, 2020",4,"""The boy is dangerous. They all sense it, why can't you?""

I'm watching all of them again after a while and with more attention. Lucas did a good job trying to match the style and edition used on the other films of the franchise. The cuts, angles, and even the filter to make the movie look old.

Those easter eggs are awesome and guess I saw all. Some things that I noticed were that some badly finished make-up and some directing fails, with the nonexistent scenario and characters. It may be just hard enough to act with no one besides green background or is just, too, to make it look more like the old movies. They too had some scenes fail like those."
"Jun 01, 2020",5,10x better then the ST
"Jun 01, 2020",2,i'm only giving it this many stars because of the music and the darth maul fight.
"Jun 01, 2020",3.5,"No Star Wars movie falls below the 7/10 threshold, but this one came close!"
"May 31, 2020",5,Still a better love story than twilight and still a better plot that Last Jedi.
"May 30, 2020",5,music is so good the fight at the and too 10 times better then the disney triology
"May 29, 2020",2,"Maybe it was the decades of anticipation. Perhaps we just expected magic. The truth is, this isn't an awful movie. But neither is it good. Best to just skip and re-watch the original trilogy again."
"May 28, 2020",1,"Perhaps in hindsight, jumping back into film making after a 10 year hiatus and attempting to make one of the most highly anticipated films ever, wasn't such a great idea.  The film is confusing and boring. And truly unwatchable. The plot of the film once you can finally figure out what is supposed to be going on is actually quite good.  But the screenplay, acting and execution is very very bad."
"May 25, 2020",4,"This movie is hated on way too much. It has one of the best Star Wars soundtracks and arguably the best lightsaber fight. People complain about the movie having politics, but it just adds to the world building, and besides, it's a crucial plot point for how Palpatine comes to rule the galaxy. With CGI that still holds up today and amazing practical effects, this movie also makes for some nice eye candy."
"May 24, 2020",1.5,This movie is terrible.
"May 23, 2020",0.5,"I was excited for this and went with an open mind despite the awful butchery committed on the original trilogy through the remasters. It sucked relentlessly the whole way through. The cast chew dutifully through the wilted script, but you can tell they know they are involved with garbage. The lamentable lack of drama is interjected by laughable special effects. The pace quickens, horns blare, drums are beaten, and with relief the whole thing is over ... but of course we know it is'nt. This joke of a movie set the tone for all the wacko garbage that got churned out in the name of Star Wars. People made money though, so that's to be happy for :)"
"May 23, 2020",5,love this movie another great movie to the star wars saga
"May 21, 2020",5,A wonderful begining to the prequel trilogies
"May 21, 2020",3.5,"Not amazing, but I love it anyway."
"May 20, 2020",4.5,"This undoubtedly one of the most underrated films in the Star Wars saga. If it weren't for some occasional clunky dialogue, it would be a masterpiece... the innovative and well done combination of traditional puppetry and figurines along with CGI technology makes for stunning battle scenes and an all-around visually impressive film. The story line is key to understanding the entire saga, combining epic battles with fascinating political intrigue and an emotional story of a young child losing both a mother and father figure along the Jedi path. This is an all-around great movie, and it's heartbreaking to see such absurg negative commentary. It's funny, full of adventure and creativity, lacks such intense darkness (while still including touching tragedy), and is indeed an incredible and underrated Star Wars movie. I highly recommend."
"May 20, 2020",5,Still better than marvel movies.
"May 20, 2020",5,"Amzing, perfect, great start to the Skywalker saga, exposition never gets boring and Jar Jar gets less screentime on future films don't worry about that. 10/10"
"May 20, 2020",4,Growing up with the Original Trilogy on VHS while still being a kid and when The Phantom Menace came out it was so amazing for me. I loved Jar Jar Binks and still don't care. The midi-chlorians introduction was neat. The Duel of Fates one of the best duels ever. John Williams killed it with the score again like he always does. Liam Neeson as the pragmatic and wise Qui-Gon Jinn was great. The introduction of the fantastically talented Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi was one of the best casting decision ever. The Pod Race was great and the design for Naboo was beautiful. Natalie Portman as Queen Padme was great too.
"May 20, 2020",5,A cinematic masterpiece.  The fate of the galaxy lies with two Jedi knights and their adventure to rescue an enslaved people.
"May 19, 2020",2,Everybody love Darth Maul.
"May 19, 2020",5,"The Phantom Menace sets the foundation for the Skywalker saga. It establishes the setting perfectly and the expansive world building makes the universe feel alive. The symbolism of Qui-Gon as a father figure for Anakin is well delivered and Duel of the Fates is in a sence the turning point in the history of the galaxy. The chosen one needs a father figure, but instead gets a brother - Obi-Wan. Star Wars is about family, and this movie tells that story amazingly."
"May 18, 2020",5,"It's a fun, visually beautiful film. Out of the three prequels it definitely has an energy closer to the originals, with enough special effects to do the impossible without relying on them to the point where the world feels fake. The younger actors aren't the best, but Qui Gon and Obi Wan really steal the show especially at the end when they duel Darth Maul!"
"May 18, 2020",1.5,"disappointing, a very bad script and horrible special effects."
"May 18, 2020",3.5,"As a kid, this was one of my favorite movies. The acting and dialogue are definitely off. However, if you don't look at it from a critical standpoint and just try to enjoy it you will have a lot of fun with this movie."
"May 17, 2020",4.5,This Film is one of the most under-rated films i've ever seen. I just really enjoy Qui-Gon's concerns about Anakin and how he thinks he is the chosen one.
"May 17, 2020",4,A good start for the prequel trilogy.
"May 17, 2020",2,I would normally give this half of star but I decided to give it 2 and the purely down to the end fight scene and the music! It's amazing how one of the worst Star Wars movies has one of the best fight scenes out of them all. I wish the other films would of used the music from the end fight scene. Apart from that the rest of true movie is trash!
"May 17, 2020",1.5,It's weird I went from loving this movie to hating most of it and star wars fans went from hating most of this movie to loving this movie. When I did a 180 star wars fans also did a 180. Ending scene 5/5 and rest of the movie is 2/5. Jar Jar makes the first and second act of this movie tolerable because he is hilarious
"May 14, 2020",3.5,"There is a big difference in two subjects of this movie. The first is the events of the movie are based around an interplanetary trade war which is where the movie fails itself as it's not the most interesting thing to watch. However, the second subject of the movie is the characters, which is where the movie more than proves itself with the amazing interactions between characters and the relationships developed leading into the next movie."
"May 14, 2020",2,jar jar binks could have been kept out and the story could have been told better with more depth
"May 12, 2020",5,My favorite Star wars movie. Sets up the prequels perfectly. Awesome fight scenes. Introduction to an interesting plot that lasts over 3 and ultimately 6 episodes.
"May 10, 2020",3,"Darth maul and guigon gin is cool, but jar jar binks gave me terrible aids of the balls"
"May 10, 2020",0.5,It was so bad I thought I was watching Space Balls 2
"May 07, 2020",2.5,"I liked this movie when went and seen it as kid in 99. That's the problem, I feel like only kids can truly enjoy this one. As an adult I notice how politically the movie is and how bad Jar Jar and Anakin are. it both bores and annoys me. Only worthy things in this movie are the fight scenes and pod racing scene. I still can't believe Liam Neeson agreed to this film."
"May 07, 2020",2,"Pudo ser muchisimo mejor, Qi-Gon es lo mejor de la peli, y la batalla de los ""gungans"" vs los androides lo peor, todas estas secuencias de guerra quedaron bastante a deber, con personajes vacios y Jar Jar Binks siendo el heroe.
Me quedo con la batalla entre Obi-Wan y Qi-Gon vs Darth Maul, una de las mejores de toda la saga."
"May 06, 2020",2.5,"This movie is an utter failure, both as film judged on its own merits, and as a Star Wars installment. A wooden cast, an over-reliance on some pretty awful looking CGI, and and mind numbingly bad plot were just way too much to overcome. The action sequences did have some redeeming value, particularly the lightsaber duels, but any good will those created was immediately undercut when the “hero” of the final battle turns out to be a 6 year old kid that bumbled his way to victory BY ACCIDENT! There are literally no stakes here. Nothing to root for. He made no sacrifice. He just accidentally pushed the wrong button (several times). Contrast that with the original films, where actual heroes went up against seemingly insurmountable odds at great personal risk and overcame through belief in themselves and in the Force. This film was an epic letdown, and certainly the low point of the entire franchise. "
"May 05, 2020",2.5,Over-reliance on CGI with little story and too much emphasis on comedy relief.
"May 05, 2020",3,"This movie was decent, very slow but the action scenes do make up for it. Some of the acting isn't the best but this is a decent movie. (I have seen them before, I'm reviewing for may 4th)"
"May 05, 2020",3,Darth Maul is good but the story is ovveral not a star wars story
"May 05, 2020",3,"Just for the record I should state that this is by no means a great Star Wars film, however (and it's a big however) it does not deserve the barrage of hate that so many fans so consistently bestow upon it, yes there are elements that leave me wanting a little bit *cough*jarjar*cough*but it is a fairly well constructed narrative, albeit with slightly uneven pacing. The big positive from the first of the prequels is that the action scenes are pretty darn good, especially the lightsaber duel between Kenobi, Jin and Darth Maul, accompanied by one of the two or three best pieces of music ever composed for the franchise in ""Duel of the Fates"", if you hear that piece during the third act and don't immediately feel pumped, you're enjoying Star Wars all wrong. That aside, I actually find the world building in episode 1 really interesting, the world before the fall of the republic is so different, we are introduced to new races and creeds, whilst retaining elements of familiarity for fans of the original trilogy. On top of all that, but the blending of practical and CGI helps to retain the feel of the original trilogy, and I much prefer puppet Yoda to the updated version in this film. Now I've got all the positives out of the way, one can't help but feel like the actors weren't really that interested in the roles, either that or the director/writers didn't want to make them sound like they wanted to be there, with the exception of the infallible Ian McDiarmid, who is such a presence whatever role he plays. Natalie Portman is pretty wooden as Padme Amidala, Ewen McGregor, usually a top notch performer, gives a stiff performance as Obi-Wan, and Liam Neeson gives off as much personality as a wamp rat. In short, Phantom Menace gives us great continued world building, beautiful visuals and edge of your seat action, but the flat, unengaging acting is often what lets it down, given how much personality is so abundant in the original trilogy."
"May 04, 2020",3,"The expectation is to know the beginning of the saga. Seeing a child Anakin, I generate the most interest. Then continue watching how the saga unfolds. I was puzzled by who Amidala was. In general the film is not out of place. Except for the child actor, who seems more like a Disney movie character (before Lucas was bought the saga) and the JarJar that gives him a humorous tone (which was not necessary), we can say that it is an acceptable production."
"May 04, 2020",2.5,"It's obvious as to why George Lucas made the prequel trilogy, he just wanted to try out CGI effects, did it work? Kind off. I wasn't invested in the story that The Phantom Menace presented, I just didn't find it very interesting mainly because I was too distracted looking at the visual effects but there are strong characters in this film apart from Jar Jar Binks who is so annoying and wasn't needed in the film. This Star Wars film isn't the best but it isn't the worst, it's alright for what it is but it could have been way better, what saves this film from being bad are the strong characters and the final duel between Qui - Gon Jinn, Obi - Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul"
"May 04, 2020",2,"A bland, boring, lifeless Star Wars film. The final battle somewhat makes up for it though."
"May 03, 2020",2,"George Lucas' attempt to provide a backstory to the original saga is unfortunately sorely lacking. His endeavour into an even longer time ago in a galaxy far away leaves much to be wanted. The dialogue is wooden at best, which we can't really blame the actors for when the only directions they get are ""faster and more intense"". Like Carrie Fisher said ""you can write this stuff but you can't say it"". All Star Wars movies prior to episode I starts off thrillingly. Episode IV; a star destroyer pursuits the rebel ship. Episode V; Hoth Battle. Episode 6; Jabba's lair. And now episode I, trade dispute and tax laws. This is mostly people sitting around and talking and then walking around and talking, which is incredibly exciting when it's called ""The West Wing"" but in this case it's called ""Star Wars"" and it's simply not what we signed up for. 

So why doesn't this movie get just 1 star? Seems like I really hate this picture. Well there are some qualities that make it watchable. Despite the dialogue Ewan McGregor is fantastic, which is a saving grace in the whole trilogy. Darth Maul is a great frontline antagonist, and of course the score is amazing. John Williams' ""Dual of the Fates"" makes us glad that this movie exists. Overall if you wanna get into Star Wars you probably should watch it for continuity's sake, it's not like we have much better things to do during a global pandemic. Nevertheless, if you watch them in episodical order you have great things to come, just hold on through the prequels!"
"May 03, 2020",2.5,"I do really love Star Wars but in my opinion, this is the worst of all the Star Wars movies. Its redemption comes within the last third of the movie with the lightsaber battle between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qi-Gon. The movies only go up from here."
"May 02, 2020",3.5,"I waited in line for hours to get my tickets for this movie, and then again to get my seat. It was the most exciting movie watching experience I've ever had. It's too bad that those feeling have been watered down by others' opinions, reviews and their comparisons to the other films in the series. Special effects, CGI and plot aren't bad, but some of the acting and definitely the weak script are what bring it down. Jake Lloyd likely did what he was directed to do, as did Ahmed Best. It's too bad that George Lucas' vision of this film was so different than the expectations of the fans, which are impossible to satisfy."
"Apr 30, 2020",2.5,It is a good movie but offers little to the over all story and progresses slowly.
"Apr 29, 2020",5,"Expands the marvelous universe in ways we do not expect. The visuals, plot and action is on point. The music is absolutely en par with the original trilogy. The humor has intensified a bit (in the form of much hated Jar Jar Binks), but that's ok."
"Apr 25, 2020",3,A trashy and unfitting but fun and energetic prequel in the Star Wars universe's canon.
"Apr 25, 2020",5,The podrace alone should have won an award just like the jedi did!!
"Apr 24, 2020",3,"It's not as awful as people say but it's not great either. Now, I do love the designs of Coruscant, Naboo and the home of the Gungans, the sets, creatures, planets and machinery are incrediblt creative and a step up in technology, Qui-Gon is a very likeable character, the score is excellent and it expands the Star Wars universe beautifully with a more mature (sort of), thematic story that's well structured and of course, Duel of the Fates is one of the best scenes in the franchisd. Unfortunately, the execution is bad. Jar Jar is so unnecessary, Jake Lloyd's Anakin is quite wooden, the Tatooine stuff drags on with so much unnecesafy exposition, the dialogue is not very good and the final battle has some really terrible moments. Overall, I respect this movie for trying something new even if it didn't work out fully"
"Apr 24, 2020",2.5,I didn't like this movie. I give it a 55% and nothing higher. I Jar Jar Binks ruined the entire movie and Darth Maul is the only reason the movie has anything above 10% in my book. Qui-Gon Jin was a character who deserved better and seeing Obi-Wan Kenobi without a beard was too strange. Only watch this movie because of its importance to the Skywalker saga.
"Apr 23, 2020",5,In my opinion it is fantastic everything a true star wars fan expects giving little nuggets of information and teasing a little bit more
"Apr 22, 2020",3,"La Amenaza Fantasma, objetivamente y desde mi punto de vista, es la más ""debil"" de las precuelas.
El guión en sí es algo complejo para una película dirigida para un público ""infantil"", destaco esto ya que la saga en general tiene varios aspectos que no son para niños, como las tramas políticas, la mayoria no les agrado este aspecto, es algo esencial en la historia, pero tiene momentos que son aburridos para el espectador, en cuanto a las actuaciones, no son las mejores, pero tiene grandes papeles como el personaje de Qui-Gon, interpretado por Liam Neeson, y el personaje de un joven aprendiz Obi-Wan, hecho por Ewan McGregor, pero hay personajes que irritan, como es Jar Jar Binks, aunque se vuelve importante después de todo, hubiera sido mejor descartarlo en el film. Los efectos especiales con el pasar de los años envejecieron mal en algunas escenas, en cuanto a la narrativa se siente en varias ocasiones lenta, pero mejora en la mitad de la película.
Destaco su originalidad, es cierto que hay ideas que no estan bien ejecutadas del todo, pero hay otras que si, por ejemplo los confilctos políticos y el origen de los Midiclorianos. 
Lucas creo mundos increíbles, lleno de criaturas con sus culturas y propositos, la acción es de los puntos más fuertes de la película y su banda sonora hace que las escenas sean mucho más magnificas.
Calificación: 6,5/10"
"Apr 19, 2020",0.5,"Wish I could give it any lower rating. Its just awful. From the visuals, to the screenplay, to the dialogues, to the acting. Just plain awful. Its a pain to watch these movie"
"Apr 18, 2020",3.5,"If you would look at this film, ignoring the almost-perfect originals and I think Revenge of the Sith. It isn't all that bad. Although it had problems with the excruciatingly painful beginning mostly due to the character Jar-Jar Binks, it held it's own towards the end. Overall, this movie has a rough start but an above average ending (that duel at the end)."
"Apr 17, 2020",3.5,"For me, this was the first movie to see of the saga. It introduced me to this wonderful world... And I liked it! Yes, the story is not so good. But this shows the beggining of it all. And set bases for all the story to come!"
"Apr 16, 2020",2.5,The only good part was Darth Maul first appearance on screen 
"Apr 15, 2020",3,"It's an under-average film. I honestly don't HATE it but there are a few aspects I do HATE.

"Apr 10, 2020",2,O pior Star Wars de todos o tempos
"Apr 07, 2020",4,"kinda boring, but ok"
"Apr 07, 2020",2,"I'd give this a 1.5/5, but seeing Liam Neesen with a lightsaber and teaming up with young Obi-Wan to fight Darth Maul (one of my personal SW villains), gives it an extra half star. But this is not a good movie. Young Anakin was terrible, and Jar Jar Binks is the worst SW character ever."
"Apr 06, 2020",4.5,"This movie to me is amazing! The action in the movie is truly amazing and even though some of the parts can be boring, the story-telling is great. I love how Palpatine manages to take advantage of the Republic and how his ultimate plan is starting to unfold. Darth Maul is a great villain and their epic lightsaber duel at the end was phenomenal! I don't mind Jar Jar because his foolishness always makes me smile a little bit (despite the controversy). This movie is a great way to start the prequel trilogy!"
"Apr 06, 2020",3.5,"In the wildly unlikely event that George Lucas should ever read this; I am so, so sorry. I despised this movie when it came out. I grew up with Star Wars, seeing 2/3 in theaters in the 80s, and this wasn't merely a continuation of exactly that, so I hated it.  It was for kids and I was in my 20s so I hated it. It was goofy and corny and I was in my 20s and couldn't admit the OT was goofy and corny so I hated it. Time goes by. Things change.  Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams happen.

TPM was not what anyone was expecting, because it wasn't what we had seen.  What we had seen, however, was a popcorn action flick in the middle of the story.  TPM sets up that story. So while we may complain about trade federations and blockades, that's where the story begins, in a boring and innocuous way, much like all wars. And it's a huge story and a huge war, difficult if not impossible to tell in any format and unthinkable in film before 1999. 

Rewatching with my children has given me renewed love for Anakin, Qui-Gon, and yes, even Jar Jar. It's stiff, wooden, operatic, theatrical, and all over the place, its spilling gold at our feet and we kicked the dust complaining that it wasn't like our leaden toys of old."
"Apr 03, 2020",2.5,"Honestly, Jar Jar Binks kind of ruined it for me. This is definitely the worst of the prequels and might even be the worst in the entire Star Wars movies."
"Apr 02, 2020",0.5,What the f*#k why was this made
"Apr 01, 2020",3.5,"I realize this is an unpopular opinion, but c'mon the pod-racing scene and the Darth Maul battle are two of the most memorable scenes in the entire franchise. Everything else about this movie is garbage from Jar Jar Binks to well Jar Jar Binks. Why George Lucas?"
"Mar 29, 2020",1.5,A horrible movie it is. Jake Lloyd playing Anakin Skywalker is a disaster and George Lukas's editing &amp; directing makes this movie as tension-less as it can get. What the hell happened to his mind? I don't get it. This movie is mysteriously bad.
"Mar 29, 2020",2,Ridiculous underwater scene
"Mar 25, 2020",4.5,"I found the Phantom Menace really good. It's got a good story, good acting, and a great soundtrack. It's not my favorite Star Wars film, but I still love it as I love every other Star Wars film."
"Mar 25, 2020",3,"This Star Wars prequel was pretty good. Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie. The plot to the movie was great and action packed. The special effects in this movie were pretty cool too. I did like this movie, but it wasn't as great as the originals. I would still recommend it though."
"Mar 24, 2020",2.5,Worst Star Wars Movie
"Mar 24, 2020",2.5,"It could've been shorter, better edited, and some aspects of the movie haven't aged well. It is admirable for the risks it took though."
"Mar 23, 2020",4,me ha gustado bastante la verdad
"Mar 22, 2020",3,"It has special effects that didn't age well, wooden acting and terrible dialogue, but The Phantom Menace compensates its flaws with a compeling narrative that shows promise for the next installments."
"Mar 21, 2020",1.5,Sacrifices characters for word building... duels of the fates sequence is fun but everything else is disappointing 
"Mar 21, 2020",0.5,"I forgot how bad this movie is till seeing it again recently. I thought SW 8 was bad. This is the worse of all. Jar Jar Binks is borderline cringe worthy every scene he's in. almost as bad is that leader of the underwater people. McGregor and Neeson must of taken something to keep them from laughing at those scenes. Want 1 scene that is a joke to the max. So Neeson and Mcgregor follow Jar Jar into the water and use some sort of device to breath underwater. far fetched but I'll let that slide. But when they appear in that underwater capsule,  they are both totally dry. Just a joke. I'm actually stunned that this is even getting 59 in RT.  I guess more people are doing mushrooms while watching tv than I thought.."
"Mar 21, 2020",2.5,I don't really see why this needed to exist.
"Mar 20, 2020",5,It really good just put jar jar binks out and you'll see
"Mar 19, 2020",3,"While there is fun to be had, it can be rather kiddy and/or cringey a bit too often, although the politics didnt bother me that much. 76%."
"Mar 17, 2020",4,It's like the original film in feel...but different. Yay John Williams for a great score! The acting (with the ghastly exception of Natalie Portman) is consistently fine. Great story that doesn't pander to the infantile.
"Mar 16, 2020",4,It  was okay. I still liked it since it shows how Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi came to be. It answers my questions on what happened to Darth Vader and all. Better to watch this to know the story well.
"Mar 15, 2020",3,This film gets slated too much but it isn't actually that bad
"Mar 12, 2020",4,"Fuck me, I still enjoy The Phantom Menace. The positives, which I've got with this movie have got to be Darth Maul, The Podrace scene, The lightsaber fights which Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) have with the droids and especially the fight with Darth maul, that's just amazing, especially with the John Williams score it works so well while the scenes are happening. Also, the actors of Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn have got some great chemistry while they're on set together. Finally, I've got to say Jar Jar binks has to be another positive to this movie, he actually adds quite a few good funny laughs to this movie. The negatives, which I've got with this movie has to be the outdated cgi effects and the really outdated greenscreen effects. Also, another negative I've got with this movie has to be, there isn't much Darth Maul throughout it. Finally, my last negative to this movie has to be some of the cgi which doesn't hold up well during the fight scene on Tatooine when Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul are fighting and the final fight scene, when the doors open the camera work looks like a 360 video. Overall, it's quite an outdated movie today but it's pretty good for a Star Wars movie."
"Mar 12, 2020",3,Probably my least favorite Star Wars movie but I still really enjoyed it. It's kind of a pointless movie since if you remove this movie from the trilogy/ saga you would still be able to understand overall story.
"Mar 12, 2020",2.5,"Casting great actors like Ewan and Liam did not improve this movie at all, but brought us very flashy action sequences that we Star Wars fans have never seen before. If this movie didn't have the tall squealing buffoon Jar Jar, and a different child actor to play as Young Anakin, then this movie would've been better. But it managed to pass its time with the sloppy writing and poorly acted scenes, and laughable dialogue."
"Mar 11, 2020",4.5,"The movie was so cool , the story  was beatiful, the edition magical and the actors did a good work. it is for every age (general).
     This movie has action, adventure fantasy and science fiction."
"Mar 09, 2020",2.5,"I never hated any of the Star Wars Prequels, but The Phantom Menace is definitely my least favorite of the bunch. The slow pacing, coupled with cardboard characters, toilet humor, and poor CGI effects just make it hard to sit through. That said, there are still some genuinely great things there. The blend of CGI with practical effects is fantastic in many scenes (not including CGI characters), the worlds are gorgeous and full of life, and the pod-race is a monumental achievement in audio and visual effects. Oh, and how can anyone forget Darth Maul, and the epic duel on Naboo?? Is Jar Jar annoying? Oh yes, extremely; however, I'd still say the film is worth checking out. 2.5/5"
"Mar 08, 2020",3.5,"Jar jar has never really bothered me and this had so many amazing scenes such as the final battle and the fight against Darth Maul. Although to be fair, the political scenes were pretty bad and it had other problems as well."
"Mar 08, 2020",3.5,"The prequels are not as bad as most people seem to think. Everything is a matter of comparison and nothing was ever going to hold up to the standard of the original series. I think the prequels get so much hate because they started with The Phantom Menace, which is the weakest of the prequels. But it's not a bad watch."
"Mar 04, 2020",3.5,"After the initial disappointment this film has grown on me over the years. Yes the dialogue is clunky in patches, the acting is subpar, and there's too many unnecessary characters, but there's still a decent story being told. Seeing force users at the peak of their era is also pretty epic. This movie gets a bad wrap but it's nothing like The Last Jedi for terrible Star Wars."
"Mar 04, 2020",3,"""What do people like about the original trilogy? It's politics, right? Let's do a bunch of that, throw in some midichlorians, some JarJar, and some racial stereotypes, and we'll be printing money, trust me."" Still, it's such a nostalgia trip to rewatch. (3/5)"
"Mar 03, 2020",3,"a bit boring, but the final battle is quite enjoyable."
"Mar 02, 2020",0.5,Bored and confused...
"Feb 27, 2020",3.5,"Jar Jar is not very annoying, but still not the best of the bunch."
"Feb 24, 2020",5,Amazing movie with good action and good characters
"Feb 23, 2020",4,"Visually stunning, comprised of logically thinking characters, equipped with engaging scenes, and smooth flowing plot, Phantom Menace achieves what it should, a satisfactory introduction to the series in an entertaining delivery."
"Feb 22, 2020",3,Not bad but not good. Definitely the worst Star Wars film.
"Feb 20, 2020",0.5,"I fell asleep on this movie as a kid and revisiting it I am reminded why.

This movie is too slow and there were too many George Lucas-style cash grabs that unsettled me. Most of the movie seems to have been wanting to sell me cheap merchandise than tell an actual story. Least the pod racing video game was fun.

But George Lucas really did a number on his original creation. What's up with the Gungans? Why the pod racing scene? Midichlorians?

Not to mention the boring Jedi council scenes and the really confusing ending sequence. The movie tried to achieve too many things at once.

.5/5. RIP Darth Maul."
"Feb 19, 2020",3,Baffling but entertaining nontheless
"Feb 19, 2020",2.5,"It's a great visual experience. But this is primarily a kid's film. You have to turn your brain off to enjoy it. Still, I consider it the best of the three prequels."
"Feb 18, 2020",3.5,"The Ending may be in the foreground,but that doesn't mean that everything is terrible"
"Feb 18, 2020",3.5,"Well if you know of the originals then you understand where this movie must take you.  With that said Young Anakin Skywalker acting is a little high school drama-is at times, the big race in the middle of the film really slows down the movie and you are left wondering when will it end.  The fight for Nabu is ok, but trying to create different accents in language for different creatures can leave you wondering if you hear what they said and at times can take away from the film.  The main story line is fine and the final Jedi verse Sith battle is one of the best but the end is almost episode 4 like and yet remember they did just win a large battle for their planet so I get it.  Over all I liked the movie, it's not as bad as everyone seems to believe and I would watch is any day of the week of the newest movies episodes 7,8, and 9."
"Feb 16, 2020",3,"Bogged down by too much dialogue and not enough action and adventure, The Phantom Menace only grasps my attention for certain scenes and fails to make a lasting impression."
"Feb 14, 2020",3.5,"Cheesy but fun; it doesn't live up to the originals, but how could it.  A great third act holds this one up."
"Feb 13, 2020",2,"Ugggh. Poor writing, clunky dialogue, midicholrians nonsense, Jar Jar and young Anakin is so annoying, podracing is boring and all of the politics is boring. The only thing good about this movie is Darth Maul and the end lightsaber battle."
"Feb 11, 2020",4,"Not the best, but not the worst, this is a movie that passes the time once you look past a certain Gungan..."
"Feb 09, 2020",5,"It was great. John Williams nailed the soundtracks, the fx look perfect for their time and the story is interesting from start to finish. I never were bothered by Jar Jar as some folks say. For me it's a must watch."
"Feb 08, 2020",3.5,"Positives: This movie has the best score in all of Star Wars. The action is great, especially the final confrontation with Maul. The final act is nearly perfect. While the film suffers from mostly average characters, Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Palpatine and Watto are all very enjoyable to watch. The visuals are stunning, even to this day.
Negatives: Political mumbo jumbo, Jar Jar and certain other characters, weakened theming of the Jedi and the Force and the second act is too long and unnecessarily drawn out.
7/10 - B-"
"Feb 08, 2020",1,"This Star Wars movie is really boring, a lot of people love the prequels and i really can see why, the only good thing in the movie is the action at some points."
"Feb 07, 2020",2.5,Honestly extremely cringy
"Feb 07, 2020",3,"Story could've used some work.
Acting was alright."
"Feb 07, 2020",3.5,"Although slow at times, and yes there is errors in this movie , I feel this movie was unfairly judged. No it's not the originals nor does it try to be. I understand the hate of jar jar bunks, but are you really going to like every creature in the galaxy? Jar Jar is a great addition for kids to enjoy. Also, this film has Liam in it, that alone should be enough."
"Feb 05, 2020",3,"Maybe George Lucas thought that the Phantom Menace was an important and crucial addition to the Star Wars saga. And maybe it really was. But regardless of the movie's necessity, the fact that 'it's boring' still remains."
"Feb 05, 2020",3,"Not as bad as some say, The Phantom Menace is a decent movie that is entertaining and expands the Star Wars lore."
"Feb 03, 2020",4,"I think the movie was great. I mean i can understand why people didn't like it 
but i enjoyed it so."
"Feb 02, 2020",1,Technically the worst but at least it isn't sacrilegious to the starwars mythology
"Feb 02, 2020",5,"I love this film, as I love all the prequels, with a child's fervor. This film is many of the things that have been thrown at it. Still, it stands as a monument in the world of Star Wars. Some of it's best elements include the podracing, the Darth Maul sequence, Qui Gon and Obi Wan, and the score. Every moviegoer should give it a shot, though, be warned, you may find much of the film dull and lifeless, as I've heard so many describe it."
"Feb 01, 2020",3.5,"The fifth great SW movie. The fans are very wrong about this film, all was so nice. The first chronologie's film of SW saga. The special effects, memorable music(superb Duel of Fates), the great characters, the great lightsabers fights and the performance of Ray Park as Darth Maul; the second best vilain after Darth Vader. I admit it has imperfection but is not a reason to treat a great movie, i respect the epis.1."
"Jan 30, 2020",2.5,"This is my least favorite Star Wars film. There are some good things like Liam Neeson being in it. The final act is entertaining and well made, but the rest is boring, poorly done, and underdeveloped. What could have been a great start for Anakin's origin ends up focusing on trade relations and the Galactic Senate. Overall, the final act partially saves this film, but it's still bad."
"Jan 30, 2020",4.5,"This one is severely underrated. 20 years later and it has aged very well. Qui Gon Jin, Darth Maul, Duel of the Fates, podracing, the best lightsaber duel of any movie. It’s a classic "
"Jan 28, 2020",2.5,Hated Jar Jar but it did reboot Star Wars. In a movie marathon I avoid this movie.
"Jan 27, 2020",2.5,"There's a lot wrong with this film, although it ends up being a enjoyable watch, but purely down to the fact I love Star Wars. One of the best parts about this film is it's score, it's composed amazingly, it's sad that the best part of a action film is it's score. There's more bads than hoods and the only reason it gets slightly more stars is because I'm a Star Wars fan, but Jar Jar Binks is a awful character and that's down to the writing. The CGI/Special Effects are now very outdated and poor, that may be due to the drastic change in special effects but they don't hold to today's standard and is very noticeable. This film could've been shortened most definitely, too many sections of the film dragged on for too long, especially the pod race scene."
"Jan 26, 2020",1,Not a fan. The acting and effects are trash.
"Jan 25, 2020",3,Filme que se salva pela batalha final épica.
"Jan 25, 2020",0.5,God awful acting. Poor script. Cheesy CGI. Such a waste.
"Jan 23, 2020",5,"I love this movie,it always gets crapped on so I figured I'd log on to defend it!! It's cheesy yes but honestly that's the charm of Star Wars !! Jar jar ,pod races n all I love it !! Plus Dart maul is the shiznit!!!"
"Jan 22, 2020",2.5,"A very disappointing turn out for the first ""Star Wars"" prequel, ""The Phantom Menace"". Some solid visual effects and moments of world-building really can't justify the blatantly underwhelming performances and a lack of character development. It's the weakest entry in the once-grand franchise, and they really need to get back on track. They could have done worse though.

50/100"
"Jan 22, 2020",5,Best of all the star wars movies imo.  It gets horrible reviews from old school fans.  But at least it was an original story unlike the old rehashed plotline like in the new Disney starwars films.
"Jan 21, 2020",5,One of the most underrated movies there are. People hate it for no reason. Qui-Gon was a great character and the final duel was one of the best duels.
"Jan 20, 2020",3.5,"Great start to the saga, always enjoyed episode I! Jar Jar is LIFE!"
"Jan 20, 2020",3.5,"A fun, but wayyyyyyyyy too silly, re-entry into the Star Wars world.  Darth Maul is cool, though!"
"Jan 20, 2020",2.5,"Não é um filme horrível, mas é ruim"
"Jan 19, 2020",0.5,Painful to watch. Shockingly terrible acting and dialogue. The worst of all the movies.
"Jan 19, 2020",1,"This is an awful movie with a very bad writing. But Darth Maul, Ewan McGregor and liam Neeson were really cool :)"
"Jan 19, 2020",3.5,"Rewatching it after the sequels, I have a whole new appreciation towards it."
"Jan 19, 2020",4,"So underrated and unappreciated. Since it was the first film after the original trilogy, it got rated harshly against an extremely high standard... but if you step back and look at what it did, at the time it did it, you can appreciate it more. The prequel trilogy films are actually much better than the Disney films. Disney just has all the money in the world in a time with better cgi and technology with a wider range of franchise appeal. When one objectively steps back and takes all the variables into account; one can see that the prequel trilogy is actually better than originally thought and the Disney sequel trilogy is worse than first impressions and The Phantom Menace in particular is the best of the sequel trilogy."
"Jan 18, 2020",5,"One of the most underrated movies of cinematic history, a true masterpiece for those who wants more from science fiction than spaceships and aliens."
"Jan 18, 2020",1.5,"One of the most infamous disappointments in movie history, The Phantom Menace is filled with forgettable characters, wooden performances, silly dialogue, and a bland story.  You know you're in trouble when the only character in your movie with any sort of personality is Jar Jar Binks.  But, hey!  At least that pod racing scene was sort of neat."
"Jan 17, 2020",5,"Saw this one in the theater in 99 at the age of 28 and loved it.
Recently reviewed it and it's impact was greater with the perspective gained through the years and reflection on the characters introduced way back when the Original Trilogy was released.
So many surprises, so many lessons interpolated into the allegory without seeming preachy. I cry every time seeing the young hero so optimistic, generous and altruistic knowing the where the story of that character that George Lucas conceived will eventually end.
Masterful storytelling, solid performances, excellent cinematography."
"Jan 17, 2020",3.5,Love for the film has grown overtime 
"Jan 17, 2020",5,Acredito que mesmo com problemas de roteiro como Jar Jar Binks o filme ainda é bom. Me parece uma abordagem mais infantil com computações gráficas revolucionárias para sua época
"Jan 15, 2020",3.5,This movie does not deserve all the hate it gets
"Jan 15, 2020",3,"It may have way too much cgi and the most annoying Star Wars character to date, but this movie actually has a pretty darn good story and a very memorable lightsaber sequence, and I would much rather take this then the incoherent Johnson-Abhrams sequels."
"Jan 15, 2020",3,Perhaps Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is just lacking cinematic quality or good acting. But is still a peice of histoy because of its inspiration for using Digital instead of Film.
"Jan 15, 2020",2,"Pros: I don't like this film but it is still watchable.  I think that Liam Nelson did a great job as Qui Gon Jinn and Ewan McGregor did a great job as Obi-Wan because they were the only characters I liked other than Darth Maul in this movie. Darth Maul is a great villain and the final battle between him and Qui Gon Jinn is great and the score is pretty good. While the pod racing scene is dated it is still pretty good. 
Cons: The main Con is Jar Jar and his immature humor that didn't work and got me annoyed. There are many other problems with pacing because even when Jar Jar isn't being annoying this movie can get very boring at times especially during those senate meetings. This also has the prequel problem of bad dialogue and the graphics aren't that great and I don't like the way they made puppet Yoda look before the edited version because he looks hideous. I don't think they should have made Anakin a child because he was an annoying character and he couldn't have a romance with Padme because that would be inappropriate. Obi-Wan and Anakin should have been bonding and should have been friends but they weren't and when they did bond it felt very forced and the Jedi Counsel is like You shouldn't train Anakin but after Qui Gon Jinn's death, the council says train him all of the sudden. I also think Midachlorians are stupid.  I know this is nitpicking but in the pod racing scene, I never liked how there was a child-size helmet because he adults ride those ships. This movie also doesn't feel connected to the Skywalker Saga because all you need to know is that Obi-Wan found Anakin and Anakin made C3PO. I feel like those things make the movie frustrating because without them I would be able to likely give this movie like a (B-).

I don't like this movie but it is watchable and I can sit down and watch it. I'm gonna give this movie a (C-)"
"Jan 14, 2020",4,"Gosto da estória. Personagens novos interessantes! Pouco infantil as vezes, mas me agrada!"
"Jan 14, 2020",3.5,"Not the best Star Wars. Some annoying stuff but it's overall very ok. Darth Maul is amazing, his sword is NOT stupid but the way he uses it could be more efficient. Same goes to Obi Wan and Qui Gonn who could have won the fight multiple times in my opinion thanks to their number advantage. Fun to watch"
"Jan 13, 2020",3,"There is a lot of great stuff in it, but unfortunately it's not made well. What sounded great on paper when George wrote it, and pushed the boundaries of CGI fell short in the execution and composition. George said once about Yoda, if the puppet doesn't work, the whole film falls apart. The same goes for Jar-Jar Binks. The rumor is, he was based of the Harlequin in the Foundation from Isaak Asimov. That could have been amazing as setup in Episode 2. The Fan Theory still is that Jar-Jar is a Sith Lord, which could have saved nearly all of the Prequels, except for the acting of Anakin Skywalker. George decided to introduce him very Kid friendly for a very young Audience and probably gave up the idea after the character was badly received by the much older Fan Community. Ahmed Best was actually amazing and could have pulled the twist of. Just a few more, bolder hints, could have made the difference. All in all good for the Kids and enjoyable for what it is, but another prove that George Lucas is an amazing Writer and Producer, Business man, Visionary, Manager and Editor, but no director of actor's."
"Jan 13, 2020",2,"A classic star wars movie, and a must see for pop culture knowledge. Really liked it when I was a kid, today not so much. Great memes though."
"Jan 13, 2020",4,"I actually liked the kid they got to play young Anakin. However, I didn't like Jar-Jar Binks. I liked the pod race. I didn't like the undeveloped nature of Darth Maul. 

Overall though, it was a fun little movie."
"Jan 13, 2020",0.5,"It quite literally could not be a worse movie. I dare you - go on YouTube and watch some of the fan made Star Wars flicks. They are infinitely better than whatever this flaming waste of film was. The casting is so bad it is comical. It's as though directors do NOTHING to prevent a kid from making a mockery of the film. Public apologies are necessary for this one, but can never undo the damage they brought upon the Star Wars universe. 100% garbage. If you haven't seen it, do everything in your power to never see it. Like the holiday special, it deserves to be forgotten in the dust of history."
"Jan 12, 2020",3.5,"People always say that the scenes on trade friction and senate hearings are the most boring part of the prequels. I think that is one of this movies strongest points, showing how the emperor was able to cripple a well functioning democracy. Other parts of the movie are rich in suspense and introduce the newer characters well in a story that proves vital to shaping their personas. Action scenes one of the best in the entirety of star wars. The only issue is the exposition done by pod-racing. The pod racing scene had potential but was never developed into a complete action scene which makes it seem long and drawn out. All in all a great film and good start to the trilogy."
"Jan 11, 2020",2.5,"With a doubtful script, some unpleasant characters and a plot that does not end wrapping makes The Phantom Menace a very low delivery next to its predecessors where the only thing that saves it is the performances of Neeson, Portman and Mcgregor and some effects and incredible action sequences."
"Jan 11, 2020",5,Masterpiece in every way.
"Jan 10, 2020",5,great movie just amazing
"Jan 09, 2020",4,"this movie is for own children, but i liked it"
"Jan 09, 2020",4.5,"A good way to start off the trilogy, some complained about the politics and that ""it was hard to follow because it's boring"" to me it was actually easy to follow. On a separate note, fans who attacked Jake Lloyd should be ashamed of themselves for attacking a kid back in 1999 Jake Lloyd was fine."
"Jan 09, 2020",0.5,Its interesting to see Anakin's origins and the Darth Maul duel with Obi-wan but beyond that its simply bantha fodder.
"Jan 09, 2020",3,"Great action. Awful dialogue. Weak, boring storyline."
"Jan 08, 2020",3,"Probably the worst prequel movie because of childishness and Jar Jar, but still good original setup for whole saga."
"Jan 07, 2020",2,"I am still baffled at this movie. The only redeeming part of the movie is the score. It is interesting to watch simply to see what happens when George Lucas have full creative control, and it is almost reason enough to watch it. Almost."
"Jan 06, 2020",1,"Unlike its predecessors, this movie is devoid of soul and humor. It has the most emotionless acting, almost as if all actors were told not to emote on purpose. Top this off with the character Jar-Jar Binks and young Anakin...well, youve achieved meme fodder. Uggh, painful movie."
"Jan 06, 2020",5,"Honestly, it's a really good movie. 
It doesn't deserve nearly any of the flack it gets. Go star wars!"
"Jan 06, 2020",4,Its great movie alot of Cgi but that was peak of technology at that time.Iconic lightsaber fight between main heroes.Interesting view on politics.
"Jan 06, 2020",0.5,Boring story and useless dialog. Its a hated movie for a reason. No offense.
"Jan 05, 2020",3.5,"It is an okay start. Not great, but not as bad as everyone is saying. Jar Jar is a huge mistake, yes, but still a good stepping stone for the following movies. AOTC is where the sh*tstorm gets real."
"Jan 05, 2020",2,"nice to see anakin, but the storyline is really weak."
"Jan 04, 2020",3,"It's quite different to the original movie, but not remotely as bad as people say. It is fun and adds to the Star Wars movies, like with the (now expected) exciting fast paced lightsaber fights"
"Jan 04, 2020",2,"Rushed pacing, bad acting from otherwise great actors, bad dialogue. A flop."
"Jan 04, 2020",1.5,The only good part is the fight
"Jan 04, 2020",1.5,"Horrible Thats what it is!
I mean jesus H f*ck what is this?!!
The og trilogy was freaking AWESOME!
And then this comes out?!😕👎"
"Jan 04, 2020",5,This movie is great I don't care about the political side it still has good action sequences and a good story.
"Jan 04, 2020",3.5,Okay start for the prequel trilogy with mostly memorable characters. Some good story beats and some not so much.
"Jan 04, 2020",3,"A boring story that drudges on, although it has its great points, Darth Maul vs QGJ and Obi Wan may be the best fight in the series, and the pod race is an amazing scene to watch"
"Jan 03, 2020",3.5,"That movie it's complicated, but its a good movie, has some flaws annoying character, but a story with technological innovation for his time and start a saga when a good boy with a lot of hope become more machine, illustrate how life happen with all of us."
"Jan 02, 2020",2,Proof that Lucas had no idea what he was doing.  A New Hope &amp; Empire were some of the best sci-fi ever made.  But episodes 1-3 were lousy by comparison.
"Jan 02, 2020",4.5,I love this film because this is the first Star Wars movie growing up as a kid and when I watched it again I still love it.
"Jan 01, 2020",4,People complain about everything . This is a good movie. The only real problem with the movie is that they did not use Darth maul to his full potential . Be seemed like a minor character in the story when he should've been the biggest conflict in the movie .Not perfect at all but way better than the tfa - rise of Skywalker.
"Jan 01, 2020",0.5,A pony tail guy that looks like he works at a used cd store runs around knocking over hobby horses with legs. He meets a child who drag races and will grow up to commit atrocities because he fell in love.
"Dec 31, 2019",3.5,It was good but comparing it to the other ones it wasn't the best
"Dec 31, 2019",5,Amazing I love this film &lt;3
"Dec 31, 2019",2.5,"The movie is very slow in the middle, but the first and last half hour, and the podracer sequence all hold up. It's not a masterpiece, but it's not the worst star wars movie either"
"Dec 30, 2019",5,"Really good movie, like all 6 of the originals! Fuck the new ones though."
"Dec 30, 2019",3,"The Phantom Menace is the movie with which I entered the Star Wars Universe. My adult eye sees better why so many people were upset with it, but in my opinion, it was a fun movie. Jar Jar voice was certainly annoying, but the introduction of characters like Qui-Gon Jinn and Mace Windu was great. I agree that there was too much politics for young viewers, while the originals were driven by fast-paced action, but TFM also introduced what was probably the best light saber fight in a Star Wars movie, enhanced by it's glorious soundtrack. As itself, TFM ins't a bad movie in my opinion. It has many flaws, but also its moments of greatness."
"Dec 30, 2019",4.5,GREAT FILM GEORGE LUCAS
"Dec 30, 2019",5,Really good movie first Star Wars movie I ever saw when I was little. 👍🏻🙂
"Dec 30, 2019",3.5,Now to be fair I am a very biased when it comes to this movie. It was the first Star Wars movie ever song theaters and I thought Darth Maul was totally amazing now that I'm older I can see that it has major flaws pretty much across-the-board still a fantastic movie will always have a special place in my heart.
"Dec 30, 2019",4.5,"Better than it's given credit for. A fitting beginning for Anakin's story. A grand adventure film. Just enjoy it for what it is, a fun film. I mean it only introduced Qui Gon, Darth Maul, &amp; Mace Mindu. Want else do you people want?!?"
"Dec 29, 2019",4,I was scared to watch this movie again because of Jar jar but he is indeed just visible on their first trip to Naboo. Then Jar Jar is inexistent and the film adopts a darker tone that pays homage to A New Hope. THe universe is well establisged and i infeed laughed quite some time at Jar jar's comic reliefs. A very good surprise! The special effevts are too old but this film tried to show things at the limits of conema at this time. Well done Lucas
"Dec 29, 2019",2,"This is a terrible, terrible movie. I'm amazed that A) Lucas made a film like this, knowing how beloved the franchise was, and B) that the franchise remained so beloved after this had come out... It introduced Maul though, who is my favourite Star Wars character. So points on that one."
"Dec 28, 2019",2.5,"The story was something fitting for a prequel to the Star Wars trilogy, but god, get Jar Jar out of that."
"Dec 28, 2019",3,"Bogged down by callus acting and a convoluted plot, The Phantom Menace leaves you wanting more from Star Wars especially after a fun action packed third act."
"Dec 28, 2019",4.5,"I haven't seen Phantom Menace in years and I re-watched it today. Honestly, I thought it was great. The plot was interesting - lot of exciting moments throughout the movie. I actually thought the acting, in general, was good - I thought all the actors were good and I enjoyed Jar-Jar Binks - I found him to be great comic relief. There were some scenes that were a bit unconvincing - like the vote of no-confidence scene seemed rather rushed, though it was already quite a long movie. I felt like there were no truly boring moments in the movie. The soundtrack is awesome. Also, I've seen worse movies get better critic reviews - I don't really understand why critics hated the movie so much. The Disney rendition of Star Wars, in comparison, is a complete disservice to Star Wars lore - nothing makes sense in consideration of the Star Wars Universe and the previous Star Wars reality. What was previously a very deep film essentially was transformed into something else entirely."
"Dec 28, 2019",5,A generous and soulful blockbuster. The third act is amazing.
"Dec 28, 2019",3,"Fun to watch, I wouldn't call it good. Until Adolf Disney took over, this was probably the poorest of the saga. It was made in the 90s though so can't really blame Lucas.
Also, I always felt like some things from this could have been added to Attack of the Clones, and there could have been a movie between AotC and RotS, and this movie could have been scrapped without taking away from the story"
"Dec 28, 2019",2.5,I think the phantom menace isn't terrible like most think I also don't think it was a great movie either but it was the first time we saw some interesting battles and didn't look that bad and introduce the characters but they could have avoided alot of bad things that happend in the movie overall.
"Dec 28, 2019",2.5,Ehhh.......pretty lacking. Disappointment of a movie. Didn't have the fast action the originals had. This ranks probably number eight from worst to best on my list. I will put my final rankings in the rise of Skywalker review.
"Dec 27, 2019",2.5,"5.5/10. This is a film of two extremes - a triumph of the technical aspects of film making, yet a failure in story telling. The costumes and set pieces mesh seamlessly with the special effects (for 1998, but even still today it didn't look awful), and a typically outstanding John Williams score works with these elements to transport viewers out of their living rooms and across the galaxy. The action - particularly the podrace and final lightsaber dueling - is thrilling, even as the abysmal script, annoying or bland characters, and poor acting to match (which is a shame given the talents of the cast) threaten to waste all of the technical wizardry. While George Lucas has a knack for developing the foundations of a lush sci-fi universe, he'd have been better off leaving the finer points of directing and writing to others. The StarWars franchise would be much better served for it."
"Dec 27, 2019",4,"Good Stuff: The pod race, younger obi-wan, Darth f-ing Maul, the lightsaber duel, The action, The music, One of the best star wars endings, no joke, it's actually good, The Planets, the fish chase scene.

Bad Stuff: The Plot, JarJar at times."
"Dec 27, 2019",3.5,"stick around for the pod race and the lightsaber fights, they are so worth it. the parts in between are pretty dumb though."
"Dec 27, 2019",3,"This is a fun movie, that just doesn't tell a super compelling story. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are great, and Maul is a fantastic addition to the Star Wars Universe. Jar-Jar, Congress, and low levels of action plague the film, but when the story really moves as it does in the beginning and end, it's quite good."
"Dec 27, 2019",5,"After watching Disney rubbish movie. This is really a damm good movie. At least the lightsaber fight was damn good. At least the story make sense. At least Qui Qon Ginn and Obiwan was really convincing. At least the space fight is really good. At least the storm troopers die. At least Jedi(s) are powerful but they still die. And all Jedi(s) has their strength and weakness, they each have different roles and is very clearly shown in the movie. Disney's Star Wars is... plotless, illogical, breaks all physics, no continuity from previous 6 movies (plus Rogue One). No idea why Rey Space Jesus was ever needed to go through 3 movies when she could single handedly just destroy the entire Universe in the first 5 mins of the film. She can literally do anything. Teleport, heal people, bring dead people back to life, do Jedi mind trick, lift entire mountain range basically just do everything and anything she wants. Disney Star Wars is... just wasting people's time, it's rubbish. Its not inspiring and its almost just illogical (poor) action. Even the action sequence is BAD... REALLY BAD. I give George Lucas  STAR WARS 10 out of 5 stars. For being logical, consistent and good fight sequence."
"Dec 27, 2019",4.5,Superb. Good starting. Star Wars is amazing ♥️
"Dec 27, 2019",3,"The most forgettable Star Wars, and the worst George Lucas had to offer"
"Dec 26, 2019",2.5,A movie that 2 and 1/2 stars is generous. By far the worst Star Wars movie.
"Dec 26, 2019",5,Still better than the sequel trilogy.
"Dec 26, 2019",3,Darth Maul... saves this movie.
"Dec 26, 2019",5,"A fantastic children's movie, with great special effects, moral lessons, and a great story. While imperfect there are few movies out there that really spark the imagination and give the young a chance to visit such a rich, fantasy world."
"Dec 26, 2019",3,"Uneventful and unmemorable, with a cast of characters that are not that interesting. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is boring in this and Liam Neeson as his mentor seems be going through the motions. But it's all mildly watchable, with some moments giving us the kick that was lacking."
"Dec 26, 2019",2,"Jar jar binks is the main reason why the score is so low. He makes this movie almost insufferable. But beside that the movie is actually decent, with interesting characters and alright story which is a bit plagued by the prequel curse since we know for the most part what will happen. However It is a decent watch for star wars fans and perhaps while as not as good as the previous films, it is a good stepping stone (minus jar jar) towards the prequel trilogy."
"Dec 26, 2019",3.5,"I only recommend this as Phantom Edit version. Otherwise it will bum you out. This movie has only one problem, it is Jar Jar Binks. Everything else is really amazing, but Jar Jar is in 70% of the film, so you NEED Phantom Edit version."
"Dec 26, 2019",5,"Honestly after rewatching the movie I realized how great this film is the pod racing scene is fantastic the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and the final battle between Qui-gon, Obi-wan, and Darth Maul is amazing especially with Duel of the Fates playing in the back is amazing"
"Dec 25, 2019",3.5,Star wars is always fun but jarjar was annoying. Love to watch with my kiddo
"Dec 25, 2019",4,"Not as strong as the original series, but better than episodes 8 and 9."
"Dec 25, 2019",1,Boring to watch and no good qualities
"Dec 25, 2019",3,Darth Maul almost takes it to a good action movie. Should have been Darth Jar Jar
"Dec 25, 2019",1,"This movie was absolute crap. A total embarrassment - amateur acting from good actors, terrible plot, awful script."
"Dec 25, 2019",3.5,I actually like this movie although I understand why people hate it. The Last Jedi and parts of Rise of Skywalker actually made me appreciate this movie even more than I already did.
"Dec 25, 2019",3.5,"Some of the characters were poorly chosen and portrayed, but if you are looking for a decent story with detail and a bit of action, this is the film for you."
"Dec 25, 2019",5,"After years without a new Star Wars movie this was a great film to begin the next trilogy! Incredible visuals, sound affects, music, acting, fight scenes, and much more!"
"Dec 25, 2019",0.5,The worst film from the whole saga to my taste. Boring plot with annoying characters and bad acting.
"Dec 25, 2019",1,"It was a stupid, bad, boring mess of a movie with bad CGI and bland characters."
"Dec 24, 2019",3,"Most likely the worst star wars movie to date. It is littered with plot holes and is slightly boring. Despite this, it does have some redeeming qualities."
"Dec 24, 2019",2.5,Ray parks saved this movie
"Dec 23, 2019",3.5,"I liked this movie, it is not bad as everyone sais it is."
"Dec 23, 2019",1.5,"Characters are dope, script sucks though."
"Dec 23, 2019",4,"Most people don't appreciate this movie, but I still say it is a good prequel. Lucasfilm may have gone a bit better with this, but they did a good job. The characters are interesting, especially Jar Jar Binx, however Anakin is so young it does keep away from the story a bit. The pod racing scene is drawn out, as is the middle of the movie. However, though the story is a tad bit confusing, once you wrap your head around it, you are engrossed to see what happens."
"Dec 23, 2019",3,"While silly and outlandish with some of it's risks, plus unconvincing acting and boring dialogue, this movie is action and Star Wars fun in many parts! Cool villain, astonishingly action entertaining sequences, and one of the best light saber fights of the saga make this movie just entertaining enough."
"Dec 23, 2019",1,"Lucas messed up. Big time. Your only saving grace were Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Ray Park (Darth Maul). Otherwise, its terrible"
"Dec 23, 2019",2,"It's easy to scold the original George Lucas prequel, but what can you praise it for? Definitely for the choreography of lightsaber fighting scenes. For some new curious characters. To the midichlorians, which I personally think is a good idea. But anyway, these two and a half pluses will never be able to resist the avalanche of shortcomings of the film, the main of which are a waste of screen time, poor CGI, replacing the practical effects native to the heart, neutered action and more than ever boring script, proving that the franchise could really exist without the first episode."
"Dec 23, 2019",3.5,Too deep for this Time.
"Dec 23, 2019",3,I saw this 12 times in the theater with my then girlfriend. It's amazing the stuff I put her through.
"Dec 23, 2019",0.5,The worst movie I have ever seen
"Dec 22, 2019",3,"With the first prequel to the first Star Wars Saga, it falls short with boring introductions to characters and story, but at least offers some impressive action set pieces from the Pod Race on Tatooine to the climatic light saber fight with Darth Maul. Not the best way to start a series but not really the absolute worst way to~"
"Dec 22, 2019",0.5,A comedy of a movie 
"Dec 22, 2019",2,"It was bad, possibly the worst Star Wars film. It is mostly skippable."
"Dec 22, 2019",5,"Loved it.  Of the prequels, I thought it was the best."
"Dec 22, 2019",2.5,I thought it was kinda a waste of a very good villain I do like the back story of anikan feels like a mediocre movie
"Dec 22, 2019",5,"Amazing visual, battles and characters, including Jar Jar!"
"Dec 22, 2019",3.5,"Not at all what fans wanted and that is part of the problem. One of them being how Anakin saves the day out of a ""fluke"". However it does get better every time you watch it. I'm not one of those who ever disliked this movie and I now I think it's really good."
"Dec 22, 2019",0.5,Garbage. Should be remade.
"Dec 22, 2019",2.5,"Pretty good story. Atmosphere was at times like it should be in Star wars movies. Could give half star more if without jar jar, animated characters was childish, Anakin's spacebattle was little bit too mutch. I will miss Liam Neeson."
"Dec 22, 2019",5,I know that this film hasn't aged well but I grew up with the prequel trilogy and they were absolutely amazing. I don't think they deserve the full hate that they get. The best part of this film for me was always the end lightsaber duel of fates. Great memories as a kid
"Dec 22, 2019",1.5,"Alles in diesem Film, außer Qui Gon, Darth Maul Lichtschwert Kampf und John Williams Music ist Schlecht und Kindisch"
"Dec 22, 2019",4,fantastic. if you love star wars you will love this.
"Dec 22, 2019",0.5,Jar Jar Binks. Nuff said
"Dec 22, 2019",2,"Boring, confusing but saved by the bell. I could not describe the plot of this movie to anyone who has or hasn't seen this movie. The scenes besides the pod racing and final duel are completely forgettable and boring. There isn't any chemistry between the characters and they don't help drive the plot forward. You are asleep until you realize it is almost the end with the amazing duel between our main protagonists and antagonist. Without this scene, there would be no question within the fandom that this is a BAD movie. Worth a try for those scenes but skip it if you want to get straight to the real Star Wars treat."
"Dec 22, 2019",4,Would’ve been 5 Stars if Jar Jar Binks wasn’t in it. 
"Dec 21, 2019",0.5,"Worst, most horrible Star Wars movie ever."
"Dec 21, 2019",3.5,"I would definitely recommend it. 

Jedi master Qui Gon Jinn and Darth Maul are great characters to add to the saga. 

Midichlorians story was really unnecessary, felt like narrowed the meaning of force."
"Dec 21, 2019",5,It's Star Wars so 5 stars
"Dec 21, 2019",4.5,though many people don't like this film I think its amazing and should be hold in high regards
"Dec 21, 2019",4,Saw it the other day again and it’s always been my least favorite but I like it more now
"Dec 21, 2019",4.5,"THIS JUST FEELS LIKE STAR WARS.  THE STORY IS GREAT, ACTING AND JUST ENJOYABLE TO WATCH.  THESE ARE MY CHILDHOOD AND STARTED MY STAR WARS FANDOM."
"Dec 21, 2019",3,"Some interesting ideas and visuals, but it lost sight of what made the original Star Wars films special. Amazing score by John Williams."
"Dec 21, 2019",2,Characters are for the most part wooden but does a good job expanding upon the force without destroying it. Ending fight is very entertaining.
"Dec 21, 2019",3,They could have done with out Jar Jar. Overall was not to bad.
"Dec 21, 2019",3.5,The Darth Maul duel is one of the best in the whole series.
"Dec 21, 2019",1.5,"George Lucas apparently lost his touch when it came to the prequel trilogy of STAR WARS. The first installment of the trilogy, THE PHANTOM MENACE is truly horrible. Underused villains, terrible CGI, and ridiculous side characters (here's lookin' at you, Jar Jar) make for an all-around awful film. Plus, Liam Neeson looks like he's trapped in hell."
"Dec 21, 2019",2,"Drags on, quite boring and uninteresting. It's story can be summed up as follows: Anakin is found by Liam Neeson. Anakin meets Padmé. Liam Neeson dies by Darth Maul's hand and Obi Won Kenobi defeats Darth Maul. Nothing else in the movie is relevant to the overall story. Duel of the Fates and the Pod Racing are the best parts of the movie."
"Dec 21, 2019",5,"Maybe it's because I saw it at 14, but I didn't have it!"
"Dec 21, 2019",5,"While Jar Jar can be quite an odd character and somewhat annoying, and the whole Pod Racing part could be removed and you lose nothing to do with the plot, this movie perfectly begins the trilogy of how Palpatine manipulated the force and Anakin into destroying the republic.

Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but definitely a great movie."
"Dec 21, 2019",3,"Achei legal, ele é um ótimo filme para se começar se conhecer a franquia, claro. Na minha opinião."
"Dec 21, 2019",2.5,"A lot went wrong with this film. After coming out of the original trilogy there was a lot of weight on this movies shoulders but unfortunately they didn't succeed. Im going to start off with the good first. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are both great in their roles however McGregor still wasn't used to George Lucas' lines. Darth Maul is a fantastic villain and gives off a menacing presence while only delivering a few lines in the whole movie. The fight scenes were improved significantly from the OT as the final lightsaber duel in this film is the best ever and it is only made more awesome by having John Williams' amazing Duel Of The Fates track playing in the background. The Visuals, although not aged well, were great for the time and were revolutionary. Where the film fails is with the rest of the characters. They are all so bland, uninteresting and just downright annoying (Anakin and Jar Jar) and it doesn't help that the actors had trouble delivering Lucas' lines which is another problem with the film, the dialogue, the dialogue is incredibly bad it's surprising that they were written by the same person who did Empire Strikes Back. The Plot is fine for the most part except for a few subplots that dragged the film. Overall this film is a massive downgrade from the OT however it is far from the worst Star Wars film. I give this movie a 5/10."
"Dec 21, 2019",5,I am sorry but i loved all of it
"Dec 21, 2019",3,Good solid movie. lacking in areas
"Dec 21, 2019",1.5,could be better. Though the lightsaber battles were something else.
"Dec 21, 2019",4.5,Great Star Wars movie
"Dec 21, 2019",1.5,"Easily the weakest of the Star Wars films, this movie is a chaotic mess that somehow manages to be boring for the vast majority of its 133 minute run time. The final showdown between Maul, Obi Wan, and Qui Gon remains perhaps the best lightsaber duel in the entire series, but it can't save this boring trainwreck of a film. The characters are flat, the dialogue is horrid, the movie does little to no work to set up the films it supposedly serves as a prequel to, and the plot is mostly about trade embargoes for some reason. Watch this movie for the music and the memes and nothing else."
"Dec 21, 2019",4,Was great seeing Jedi on the big screen again. Idk about the whole Jar Jar idea.
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,"While it was fun in parts, it suffers in pacing and immersion for myself. It expands the galaxy the franchise takes place in, and on its own it is not the worst experience. However the movies before and following it put it in its place as one of the less engaging of the franchise."
"Dec 20, 2019",2,You must unlearn what you have learned.
"Dec 20, 2019",1,"Growing up with the original trilogy, and watching this trilogy was a resounding disappointment. This was the beginning of the downfall of Lucas. The special effects looked bubbly and cartoonish. It completely lacked the feel of the original movies. The vehicles looked more advanced/elegant that the original movies, and that doesn't make any sense because they were prequels. The acting was some of the worst I'd ever seen in a major motion picture. Surely technology advanced. The one saving grace for this trilogy was the incredible acting for the famous character Obi-Wan. Sam Neeson was incredible throughout.

The first of the trilogy is by far the worst thing released in the Star Wars Franchise, and is barely reminiscent of the Star Wars Universe."
"Dec 20, 2019",4,Love the theme of fate in this movie 
"Dec 20, 2019",4,"Yes, Jar Jar is weird and stupid. But, this movie has the best lightsaber fights!"
"Dec 20, 2019",2.5,Slow start and pretty much carried by Dual of the Fates.
"Dec 20, 2019",3,2nd least favorite star wars movie(solo is my least favorite)
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Duel of the Fates is all I need to say.
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,"An absolutely fascinating story from beloved Star Wars' creator, George Lucas. A great flow and easy to follow plot. An amazing origin story for the saga we all love"
"Dec 20, 2019",2.5,"The phantom menace doesn't give the fans what they wanted, it is far away of the original saga, but it has astonishing scenes that makes it better."
"Dec 20, 2019",4,movie is much better then what people give credit for...
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Awesome is an understatement
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"The worst prequel, but it still is the best possible introduction to  the franchise"
"Dec 20, 2019",1.5,This was not only a disaster but due to its lack of connection to 2 and 3 a very unneeded disaster full of boring charcters huge plot holes and missed opportunity
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"This is the first Star Wars movie I ever saw. I love the podracing. I love Darth Maul's introduction. I love Palpatine's initial rise to power. The battles at the end are spectacular and go on with seemingly no end; which, I personally love. Jar Jar made me laugh as a kid, and I love the underwater sequence. Qui-Gon Jinn is a rare glimpse at a Jedi Master who went against the council and did his own thing. The special effects rock and 90% still look amazing. Overall, this is not my favorite Star Wars film, but it is up there as a classic for me."
"Dec 20, 2019",3,"As a true fan of the saga, this film upset me a bit, however, I am a fan and this film had many brilliant moments."
"Dec 20, 2019",5,"Great cast, great scenario, great venture into the galaxy far far away!"
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,The movie that sparked my love for Star Wars. Is it perfect? No. Did I enjoy watching it as a kid and still do so today? Hell Yeah
"Dec 20, 2019",3.5,"Awesome, the only conplaints about the film i have is the scenes on tatooiene( minus the pod race) abd a couple of performances, everything else is great especially the final lightsaber fight"
"Dec 20, 2019",3,"A dream-like zen experience. Strange, interesting, and also profoundly boring. It's the least 'Star Wars-y' Star Wars film, but also the most 'George Lucas-y' one.
Duel of the Fates to this day is incredible, and probably what saves this movie."
"Dec 20, 2019",4,"While not the greatest star wars movie ever made, it's positives outweigh its negatives. Jar Jar is a the biggest negative but even he shines sometimes and the final fight scenes make one forget all of the bad, especially with duel of the fates playing."
"Dec 20, 2019",4,Best star wars music and battle. The jedi council and temple idea was awesome
"Dec 20, 2019",5,Better then rise of skywalker
"Dec 19, 2019",1.5,"Yikes, this one is so bad that I think I fell asleep the first time I saw it."
"Dec 19, 2019",2.5,"Let me tell you something. Star Wars Episode One is one of the hardest films to talk about. The reason: Everything that has been put into by George Lucas. The screenplay focuses on politics rather than action, the visuals were bland, and some of the characters were stereotyped like the aliens who represent the CIS. Let's not mention Jar Jar Binks please. On a positive note, Darth Maul was an interesting character with little dialogue and Ewan McGregor is perfect as Obi-Wan. Overall, The Phantom Menace was just a film with some good and bad ideas from the start."
"Dec 19, 2019",5,It is way to underrated and compared to the sequels it is a masterpiece
"Dec 19, 2019",3.5,Lots to like even with Jar Jar.
"Dec 19, 2019",3,I loved it as a kid but not so much now
"Dec 19, 2019",3,Have bad dialogues but in some point tell a consistent story a we can see where everything begin
"Dec 19, 2019",2.5,"Better than Attack of the Clones. A much more consistent movie compared to the other prequels, with a few boring bits in between."
"Dec 19, 2019",5,Not as bad as the hate. I love young Anakin and the pod racing scene.
"Dec 19, 2019",5,"It's really the perfect beginning for Star Wars. It has all the light and the dark anyone could ask for, and lays the complex groundwork for future episodes expertly. That which is great has small beginnings, and the impatient are missing much here."
"Dec 19, 2019",0.5,Just watch the movie and try not to laugh. Comedic gold. Midochlorians - Genius
"Dec 19, 2019",5,"The main porpuse of this movie it's showing us the little Anakin, and begins of the Darth Side with Sidius and Maul."
"Dec 19, 2019",2.5,"Disappointing, yet entertaining, and not the worst movie in the franchise."
"Dec 19, 2019",4,"Es lenta pero disfrutable, lo que hace perfecto es la introducción de nuevos planetas, personajes y especies sin descuidar su esencia. Las escenas finales lo mejor"
"Dec 19, 2019",5,"I loved this film, I don't care what people say it was great."
"Dec 19, 2019",1.5,"George Lucas seems to have completely forgotten that in 1999, most diehard Star Wars fans were NOT 12 year olds but grown ups who wanted a bit more brains into ""The Phantom Menace"". For a movie aimed at ""kids"", its contrived plot about a scheming trade federation and a separatist movement within the republic seems utterly out of place. The contradictions with the original trilogy abound. Example? In ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Obi Wan Kenobi tells Luke Skywalker in a vision that he should go to the Dagobah system, to learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed him. Are you sure Ben?!?!? In this movie, it's not Yoda but Qui Gon Jin who instructs Kenobi. Only after Qui Gon dies does Yoda take matters into his hands, but we never see him ""instruct"" ANYTHING to Obi Wan, who's already quite self sufficient as a Jedi knight. Why was Qui Gon ""forgotten"" in the original trilogy? ""The Phantom Menace"" happens 20 years BEFORE the events on ""A New Hope"". If so, why do we see technology FAR superior than the one in the Original Trilogy?!?!? Why do we see R2-D2 do things we thought were impossible in this movie? Surely he could've used the same tricks in ""A New Hope"", but those ""special gadgets"" were never called upon. I understand that Lucas had way more resources to put on an amazing movie, but he went overboard, specially with his heavy handed use of CGI. At times, ""The Phantom Menace"" feels more like watching a modern video game, not a movie. 
And the acting! Having the talents of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did little to hide the cringe worthy dialogue. Sure, everyone hated Jar Jar Binks. If only his screen time could've been edited down it would've been fine, but what's even MORE grating was Anakin. Instead of showing us some brooding 10 year old, we get a happy-go-lucky kid who somehow ends up being the meanest Sith Lord in the galaxy! And that midiclorian mumbo jumbo trying to explain the power of the force in biological terms was uncalled for. 
If ""The Phantom Menace"" shaped your childhood and turned you into a Star Wars fan, then that's this movie's sole saving grace... and John Williams always spot-on, rousing score. The movie's most interesting character, Darth Maul, was disposed of in minutes, a wasted opportunity to develop a far more interesting film. 
When people tell me that ""The Last Jedi"" is worst than asbestos, I bet they hold ""Menace""'dear to their hearts. 
I saw it at the movie theater, I've seen it many, many times at home, first on VHS, then on DVD and now on Bluray, but the feeling is the same: not good.
While ultimately offering shallow entertainment, ""The Phantom Menace"" still is my LEAST favorite Star Wars movie and the one that gave all the prequels a really bad name (""Attack Of The Clones"" was slightly better)."
"Dec 18, 2019",3,"Pretty decent, but could be better."
"Dec 18, 2019",2.5,The Phantom Menace is not the worst Star Wars it is truly ok. it feels so slow and has some pretty bad acting from of the cast. Qui Gon and Obi Wan are great and the Duel of Fates battle is great. It is just ok.
"Dec 18, 2019",3,Nice characters and world building. But bad story telling.
"Dec 18, 2019",5,its good stop the Bullshit
"Dec 18, 2019",5,Episode one has the best light saber battle in the entire saga.
"Dec 18, 2019",3.5,"Given the proper time to deeply analyze, this movie was a great start to the era that made the Star Wars Galaxy feel like the expansive galaxy it is."
"Dec 18, 2019",2.5,"It's Star Wars but it isn't. It has the dazzling and sometimes ground breaking visual effects but lacks the heart of the Original Trilogy. It feels a bit paint by number which leads to a lack of connection with the lead characters. And that's before we even mention the horror that is Jar Jar Binks. 

It still has its highlights. The lightsaber battles were better than anything in the original movies. It sits nicely as a really solid kids movie in the end."
"Dec 18, 2019",2.5,Way to much bad CGI and Jar Jar Binks... but Darth Maul was awesome
"Dec 18, 2019",3,"Всю картину портят нелепые шутки, и превращение фильма в детское. Совсем ненужный персонаж - Джа Джа Бинкс. Уж лучше бы дерево какое-нибудь привело героев в подводный мир, чем эта карикатурная жаба"
"Dec 18, 2019",3,"This is not the best Star Wars film, but this is the one that I have seen the most by a long shot. I feel like Disney should redo the CGI in the prequels and bring it up to 2019 standards, which would go a long way towards making each of those films better.

The dialogue and acting in the Phantom Menace is not as bad as the dialogue and acting in Attack of the Clones, and unlike Solo or The Last Jedi, Phantom Menace still feels like a Star Wars film. 

Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson give great performances, Darth Maul is perhaps the coolest Star Wars villain, Yoda gives some of the best wisdom he ever gives, podracing is a cool concept, the Obi-Qui-Maul lightsaber duel is perhaps the best in the series, and Duel of the Fates is the best Star Wars song. In all, there is a lot to love about this film, even if Jar Jar is a ridiculous character, the CGI looks bad now, and the politics can be a bit boring.

My Review: C+"
"Dec 17, 2019",5,It's a wonderful adventure!
"Dec 17, 2019",3,Bad when it came out but puts the Rian Johnson Star Wars movies you shame. Barring Rogue One and Solo.
"Dec 17, 2019",4,Star Wars The Phantom Menace was a great beginning of the skywalker saga 
"Dec 17, 2019",3,"Decent not terrible, could have been better"
"Dec 16, 2019",4.5,"I cannot for the life of me, figure out why people hate this movie so much. Especially in light of episodes 7-9! 
ok, midichlorians are kinda dumb, but can be explained as just a biomarker of the force as is done in the extended universe. 
Ok, Jar Jar is annoying, but just a goofy character that Lucas took a risk on and it didn't work. 
Ok, Anakin is a little annoying,,,but that makes sense. He is destined to become the most powerful person in the galaxy... he's probably going to be a little annoying. 
But come on! Pod races! Darth Mall! Qui-Gon! Excellent characters and visual effects. A complicated, but SUPER interesting plot. If you didn't like this movie on the first view, please, go back and rewatch it. Try to get over your JarJar Phobia and learn to love something wonderful. This is the first glimpse into a grand high society,  on the verge of collapse! Lucas world building at it's finest."
"Dec 16, 2019",2,"""I don't like sand. It's coarse and it gets everywhere."" - Anakin Skywalker

Well you know what Anakin, I feel the same way about you. The perfect way to summarize this movie is that you only watch it for the battle of Geonosis and even that segment was underwhelming."
"Dec 16, 2019",3.5,"This movie is actually better than people remember it. 
Go watch it again. 
Now that you have more to compare it to, you'll realise it's alright. 
Sure, Jar Jar is ridiculous, and Anakin as a boy is arrogant and annoying, but this movie had the best light saber fighting, great world building, introduction to characters like Obi Wan and Padme etc.... 
This movie is better than people give it credit for. it's almost like it's fashionable to hate it."
"Dec 15, 2019",0.5,"only thing good about this was Maul, and he died too quickly. Kid was annoying, plot complete trash. Jar Jar."
"Dec 15, 2019",1.5,"This movie had all the resources to be a great movie but fell flat on it's face. The poor dialogue, the cheesy cgi charecterals, poor storyline and bad pacing. I did like battle scenes but there was very few, but by far the most annoying thing is the movie is marketed towards children but is 80 percent politics."
"Dec 15, 2019",3.5,Its story not so good; but Darth maul brought it back up
"Dec 15, 2019",4.5,Opened up great possibilities for expanded universe.
"Dec 14, 2019",2.5,"The first quarter of the film is Star Wars. As it drags on, it just gets worse, and worse, and worse. Then at the very end, Darth Maul saves the movie. It's ok, not bad or good, just that. 2.5 out of 5"
"Dec 14, 2019",3,"Well not the best movie to start off the Prequel Trilogy, but I did enjoy some of the action scenes that were great."
"Dec 13, 2019",3.5,A society that chooses Disney's tripe over this is domed to fall like the Old Republic.
"Dec 12, 2019",3,I't is okay but the story telling is slow and boring
"Dec 12, 2019",2,The movie is ok but the 2nd worst star wars movie I love the battle scenes and the different planets. The main problem is the dialog it's very corny sure it's fine in some scenes. 2nd problem are the Characters Jar Jar and Young Anakin😑 There is a balance from bad dialog to awesome battle scenes but you still want to watch it. My top 8 star wars movies are #8 star wars #7 star wars 1 #6 star wars 2 #5 star wars 3 #4 star wars 7 #3 star wars 4 #2 star wars 6 #1 star wars 5. Star wars 9 I will watch it soon and it might be garbage.
"Dec 12, 2019",1.5,I give the same rating to Episode I and II. Just bad acting and dialogue all over the place.
"Dec 10, 2019",3,"I recently rewatched The Phantom Menace to gear up for The Last Jedi and it struck me how much of a better movie this would have been without Jar Jar Binks. I hope/think this is a lesson about ""comic"" relief (I use that term loosely) for filmmakers. The great talents of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman are completely wasted on this origin story. I think we, and Lucas, have learned that origin stories don't have to feel like homework - just setting up the future stories. Qui-Gon Jinn could have been such an epic character - a rebel following the force, even though the dark consequences of his actions, but instead the story and dialogue are so wooden - purely putting in the work to set up the rest of the story. 
There are some good visual effects and the first double bladed lightsaber and I suppose it's a must-watch if you want to be faithful to the Star Wars Saga - and, obviously, you should be, but it's severely lacking the joy and thrill brought on by the  original trilogy."
"Dec 09, 2019",1,"I personally didn't like anything. Not even the music, the action sequences, nothing."
"Dec 09, 2019",3.5,It has aged well with the passing of time.
"Dec 09, 2019",2,"Some fun set pieces, but yousa missed the mark here."
"Dec 09, 2019",5,Some flaws but still amazing.
"Dec 09, 2019",2.5,To much dialogue too little fun.
"Dec 09, 2019",2.5,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was the first movie I ever saw in theaters. My father had been a lifelong super fan of the series since seeing the original on the day after opening night. Honestly I don't remember much of that original viewing, I was very young. Only a scattered haze of podracing and lightsaber action. But as I grew older I saw this movie and eventually understood it. My opinions are probably your opinions, this movie was not the masterpiece everyone was expecting, it felt nothing like the original trilogy, it was childish, dumb, and sometimes even offensive. I agree, on all those points, and as a complete lover of Star Wars I find even more fault in it. But, I do still think there is some good to be found here. Even over 20 years later a lot of the action and effects still look great. The score by John Williams is just as good as originals and even better in some ways. Ewan McGregor's young Obi-Wan Kenobi is used sparingly in this movie, but shines whenever he is on screen. The podracing sequence, while part of a long detour in the movie, is still edge of your seat. No matter how many times you have seen it. The fantastic climatic lightsaber fight is considered one of the best in the series for a good reason. There is a lot to love and hate about this movie. But ultimately I wish it had just given me a bit more to love.   -Rhenn"
"Dec 08, 2019",3,"The story isn't the best of the Star Wars saga, the story's goes at a good pace but when it gets to tatooine its just slows a bit and when it gets to the pod racing scene (which I do like watching) it is visually stunning (at the time) but all a sudden it SLOWS down when the politics start being involved. The ending fight against Darth Maul is great along with John Williams being on top of his game with the music... Duel of the fates is some of the greatest piece of music ever. Buuuuuuuuuut the script at times is very bad and cringe to listen to, especially with Jar Jar Binks and young Anakin. But I not blaming the acting of Jake Lloyd  cause its wasn't his fault. It has some memorable moments but it does have pacing, scripting  issues, but it is not the worst Star Wars film out there."
"Dec 07, 2019",3.5,"I saw this movie when I was 17, I grew up on the trilogy.

I thought it was a good movie and still enjoy watching it."
"Dec 07, 2019",5,Possibly the greatest Star Wars movie ever made..
"Dec 05, 2019",5,"If it were the first ""Star Wars"" movie, ""The Phantom Menace"" would be hailed as a visionary breakthrough. But this is the fourth movie of the famous series, and we think we know the territory; many of the early reviews have been blase, paying lip service to the visuals and wondering why the characters aren't better developed. How quickly do we grow accustomed to wonders. I am reminded of the Isaac Asimov story ""Nightfall,"" about the planet where the stars were visible only once in a thousand years. So awesome was the sight that it drove men mad. We who can see the stars every night glance up casually at the cosmos and then quickly down again, searching for a Dairy Queen.

""Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace,"" to cite its full title, is an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking. If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable: This is the first story in the chronology and has to set up characters who (we already know) will become more interesting with the passage of time. Here we first see Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda and R2-D2 and C-3PO. Anakin is only a fresh-faced kid in Episode I; in IV, V and VI, he has become Darth Vader.

At the risk of offending devotees of the Force, I will say that the stories of the ""Star Wars"" movies have always been space operas, and that the importance of the movies comes from their energy, their sense of fun, their colorful inventions and their state-of-the-art special effects. I do not attend with the hope of gaining insights into human behavior. Unlike many movies, these are made to be looked at more than listened to, and George Lucas and his collaborators have filled ""The Phantom Menace"" with wonderful visuals.

There are new places here--new kinds of places. Consider the underwater cities, floating in their transparent membranes. The Senate chamber, a vast sphere with senators arrayed along the inside walls, and speakers floating on pods in the center. And other places: the cityscape with the waterfall that has a dizzying descent through space. And the other cities: one city Venetian, with canals, another looking like a hothouse version of imperial Rome, and a third that seems to have grown out of desert sands.

Set against awesome backdrops, the characters in ""The Phantom Menace"" inhabit a plot that is little more complex than the stories I grew up on in science-fiction magazines. The whole series sometimes feel like a cover from Thrilling Wonder Stories, come to life. The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained ""Julius Caesar."" I wish the ""Star Wars"" characters spoke with more elegance and wit (as Gore Vidal's Greeks and Romans do), but dialogue isn't the point, anyway: These movies are about new things to look at.

The plot details (of embargoes and blockades) tend to diminish the size of the movie's universe--to shrink it to the scale of a 19th century trade dispute. The stars themselves are little more than pinpoints on a black curtain, and ""Star Wars"" has not drawn inspiration from the color photographs being captured by the Hubble Telescope. The series is essentially human mythology, set in space, but not occupying it. If Stanley Kubrick gave us man humbled by the universe, Lucas gives us the universe domesticated by man. His aliens are really just humans in odd skins. For ""The Phantom Menace,"" he introduces Jar Jar Binks, a fully realized computer-animated alien character whose physical movements seem based on afterthoughts. And Jabba the Hutt (who presides over the Podrace) has always seemed positively Dickensian to me.

Yet within the rules he has established, Lucas tells a good story. The key development in ""Phantom"" is the first meeting between the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and the young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd)--who is, the Jedi immediately senses, fated for great things. Qui-Gon meets Anakin in a store where he's seeking replacement parts for his crippled ship. Qui-Gon soon finds himself backing the young slave in a high-speed Podrace--betting his ship itself against the cost of the replacement parts. The race is one of the film's high points, as the entrants zoom between high cliff walls in a refinement of a similar race through metal canyons on a spaceship in ""Star Wars."" Why is Qui-Gon so confident that Anakin can win? Because he senses an unusual concentration of the Force--and perhaps because, like John the Baptist, he instinctively recognizes the one whose way he is destined to prepare. The film's shakiness on the psychological level is evident, however, in the scene where young Anakin is told he must leave his mother (Pernilla August) and follow this tall Jedi stranger. Their mutual resignation to the parting seems awfully restrained. I expected a tearful scene of parting between mother and child, but the best we get is when Anakin asks if his mother can come along, and she replies, ""Son, my place is here."" As a slave? The discovery and testing of Anakin supplies the film's most important action, but in a sense all the action is equally important, because it provides platforms for special-effects sequences. Sometimes our common sense undermines a sequence (for instance, when Jar Jar's people and the good guys fight a 'droid army, it becomes obvious that the droids are such bad fighters, they should be returned for a refund). But mostly I was happy to drink in the sights on the screen, in the same spirit that I might enjoy ""Metropolis,"" ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Dark City"" or ""The Matrix."" The difference is that Lucas' visuals are more fanciful and his film's energy level is more cheerful; he doesn't share the prevailing view that the future is a dark and lonely place.

What he does have, in abundance, is exhilaration. There is a sense of discovery in scene after scene of ""The Phantom Menace,"" as he tries out new effects and ideas, and seamlessly integrates real characters and digital ones, real landscapes and imaginary places. We are standing at the threshold of a new age of epic cinema, I think, in which digital techniques mean that budgets will no longer limit the scope of scenes; filmmakers will be able to show us just about anything they can imagine.

As surely as Anakin Skywalker points the way into the future of ""Star Wars,"" so does ""The Phantom Menace"" raise the curtain on this new freedom for filmmakers. And it's a lot of fun. The film has correctly been given the PG rating; it's suitable for younger viewers and doesn't depend on violence for its effects. As for the bad rap about the characters--hey, I've seen space operas that put their emphasis on human personalities and relationships. They're called ""Star Trek"" movies. Give me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day."
"Dec 05, 2019",5,Greatest piece of fiction ever created.
"Dec 02, 2019",3.5,Kickass. way better then the last jedi
"Dec 02, 2019",2.5,Its an ok film not the worst Star Wars film. If you like Star Wars you will enjoy it.
"Dec 01, 2019",4,The Skywalker Saga Begins!
"Dec 01, 2019",4.5,"The action was great, how ever the plot was not great. I think a must see star wars movie."
"Dec 01, 2019",5,My favorite star wars. I wish the new ones followed the same path b
"Dec 01, 2019",5,Loved it! Visually stunning with a great story and probably the best sound score of the series.
"Nov 29, 2019",2.5,Many people were pumped for this movie and it had been a huge disappointment. This movie is putting so much complicated politics into a kid's movie. Pretty bad CGI and Jar Jar was just there for the comic relief. fine actors and bad writing. Like I don't know why this film has to be the first Star Wars film. Just stick with the original trilogy.
"Nov 29, 2019",2,"I don't know what happened to George Lucas. But this movie felt like a lazy reboot to Star Wars. You can't tell who is the main character. Jar Jar Binks is just a joke machine. There is no character arc. Obi-Wan feels like an accessory to Qui-gon. The CGI feels too fake, the original trilogy placed real life objects to make it real. Why is there politics in a kids movie. Now I know I am just pointing out the flaws. To be fair the movie did well on Anakin's chemistry with his mom. Anakin's chemistry was good with the Queen, but not as love interest. I mean she is too old to bang him."
"Nov 28, 2019",2,"Way back in 1999 the hype for this movie was unreal. It had been sixteen years since the release of the last Star Wars film and the buzz for this movie reached heights no other film ever had before. I feel sorry for the people who waited so long for this movie. It’s a mess, with a stupid nonsensical plot, and wooden characters. It’s hard to believe something this dry and bland came from the same man who created the universe this movie is set in. Call it nostalgia, call it over hype. This movie has no magic or grace of the previous three movies."
"Nov 27, 2019",5,incredibly enjoyable. amazing fight scenes and approximately 99999999 times better than the last jedi in every aspect other than the cgi being a bit older now
"Nov 26, 2019",2.5,"To be honest, this movie is better than I remember. It's certainly not the best movie in the franchise, and the whole trade war is way too complex and unnecessary, but this movie sets up a lot. It begins Palpatine's takeover of the Senate and it introduces Anakin and his fear, at least. It's necessary to watch if you want to get into Star Wars, but is not a fantastic movie."
"Nov 25, 2019",4,Can't see why people didn't like it?
"Nov 24, 2019",3.5,"An ok Star Wars movie, specially for kids."
"Nov 24, 2019",3,"I hadn't seen it in a long time and it's better than I remembered it being. Maul is great, the action is great and I really didn't mind young Anakin. The two stars off are because I still can't believe that George thought that this political action movie would appeal to kids at all. Even after just watching it, it's still crazy to me that the whole plot revolved around a queen deciding whether or not to sign a trade agreement."
"Nov 22, 2019",5,theres always a bigger fish
"Nov 20, 2019",3.5,"It's the weakest of the franchise, is slower than the other installments and at times drags, and some of the effects have aged TERRIBLY.  At the same time, it still manages to be a largely fun and fantastically plotted sci-fi political thriller that introduces us to the boy who will become Vader."
"Nov 19, 2019",4,"Movie gets better with time. The dialogue with Padme and Anakin loses it a star, but the overall plot is excellent."
"Nov 17, 2019",2,It was a very bad prequel to the amazing Trilogy.
"Nov 16, 2019",3,"Underrated, at least there's a real backstory and characters, something that can't be said for the most recent trilogy"
"Nov 16, 2019",4.5,"I really like this movie because it shows how it all started, and many don't like the idea of George Lucas being the director of this movie, but I think it's a great job with a good story, apart from the fact that there is Jar Jar this movie is very good."
"Nov 15, 2019",5,Now THIS is PODRACING!!!!
"Nov 14, 2019",4.5,I like it. I do not dislike what the general consensus does. Jar Jar Binks is just Jar Jar Binks. I am a fan of Obi Wan and Darth Maul.
"Nov 14, 2019",4,What a great way to kick-off the saga. This movie is filled with beautiful details and submerges you deep in the Star Wars Universe. The pod-race scene was exhilarating in the theater.
"Nov 12, 2019",4,"Hmmm, some fantastic new characters but badly let down by Jar Jar Binks and some dodgy dialogue. Quite good tho."
"Nov 11, 2019",0.5,"Even though this movies has amazing actors, they all are at the bottom of their games. This movie has terrible acting, cgi, and a pointless story line that goes nowhere other than killing off a character that has no significance to the Star Wars storyline.
-0%"
"Nov 09, 2019",3.5,"The action and FX are awesome, Jar Jar is annoying but not very hard to ignore. This ISNT a bad movie, it just has a few issues that other SW films didn't have"
"Nov 09, 2019",4,Much better the people give it credit for. Padme's hair and outfits give this movie a star alone
"Nov 05, 2019",3.5,Better than the Last Jedi 
"Nov 05, 2019",5,"I love this movie, I enjoyed it very much"
"Nov 02, 2019",3,"The long gap between the original Star Wars trilogy and its prequels meant The Phantom Menace was destined to disappoint many, but that doesn't excuse its flat direction and bad dialogue. The irritating character of Jar Jar Binks is a near-fatal misstep, and none of the other characters are exciting enough to make up for it. Naturally the score and production design are great, and at least George Lucas opens up the mythology instead of retreading old ground. It also gets plus points for the podrace sequence and a three-way lightsaber duel featuring the movie's largely wasted main antagonist Darth Maul."
"Nov 02, 2019",3,"I think this film gets to much hate, people make it seem like it is the worst film ever it is just because it did not live to up to super fans' impossible to beat standards. I do agree the film is not perfect it is not as bad as people say it is. It has in my opinion it has a good straight to point plot which is quite fast paced. I think the acting in this film is good to especially Liam Neeson. But I do have some complaints, three main ones the biggest one is Jar Jar he is annoying and SFX on him is also average. The other one is the SFX for action scenes the final battle scene is good for the action but the SFX is quite bad. The final one is the line ‘Now this is pod racing' is very cringey. I'm conclusion I think this is an average film I do think it is good but it does have some flaws overall you could watch it once but I do not think you could watch more than once."
"Oct 31, 2019",5,"I found the film enjoyable as a kid however certain characters dimmed my enjoyment, however when considering the whole plot I feel that it was distinct from the originals while remaining clearly in universe and also setting up the new trilogy"
"Oct 31, 2019",5,"not what the people expected back then (after the original trilogy) this movie starts a new trilogy and expends the universe in an incredible good way. The movie it self, quite good, definitely deserves a better score, I think many people just rated it bad because it wasn´t what they expected (the hype back then was much bigger compared to 7, and especial the hard core fansbase had somenting different in mind)"
"Oct 31, 2019",3,"""The Phantom Menace"" is the movie that brought Star Wars back to the mainstream media. While it is not good in comparison to any of the original three films due to the film's bad acting and poor execution, it has some bright ideas and good action sequences good enough to keep you invested, 6/10."
"Oct 30, 2019",4,It was honestly a good movie but needed a little hit of work on the cgi part and the acrobatics.
"Oct 30, 2019",3.5,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace was good. Definitely worth a watch.
"Oct 29, 2019",4,"The best Lightsaber fight of all the Star Wars Movies, between Darth Maul and Obi Wan/ Qui-Gon. Shame about Jar Jar Binks"
"Oct 29, 2019",2.5,"It has good universe building and action, with great music. However most other things are either boring or useless, jar jar makes me want to die, but Ewan McGregor is great overall about a 4.5 out of 10"
"Oct 27, 2019",2.5,Even at the time the CGI was a joke and couldn't make up for the terrible B-story of Gungdan v Droids. The running time is too long and should focus more on Darth Maul v Jedi instead of all the uninteresting subplots.
"Oct 22, 2019",1,Unwatchable and boring. How did CGI GET WORSE after all these years?
"Oct 22, 2019",1.5,I hate these kinds of Star Wars movies.
"Oct 20, 2019",3.5,Everything was great about this movie accept for bringing in Jar Jar Binks.
"Oct 20, 2019",2,"To see my movie reviews channel, go to YouTube and type in Beanlight Reviews. The following is a transcript of my movie review.

So this is the week where if you watched one SW movie per week, it'll land you right on the week of the release of The Rise of Skywalker, which comes out December 20. I'm talking the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy, the newest movies in the saga, and the two spinoff movies, Rogue One and Solo. 

Whew! That's a lot!

And while gearing up for the release of Episode 9, I'm going to watch the movies in an order I never thought I would, starting with Episode 1. Because I don't care what George Lucas says, you're supposed to start with Episode 4. But, my kids are away for a couple more weeks, and I'm going to show them episodes 4-6 for the first time in their lives when they get back, so I figured I'd get these prequel movies and spinoffs out of the way before they come home. 

Because they can watch the prequels on their own merits for all I care. But I'm gonna watch ‘em now so I can share my thoughts of them with you. 

So Episode I: The Phantom Menace.

I . . . Where do I begin? 

When I think of The Phantom Menace, two things immediately come to mind, and that's Jar Jar Binks, and Jake Lloyd, child actor. I don't want to say Jake Lloyd without qualifying it with ""Child Actor"" because he's grown man now, and could be a very good actor for all we know. Point is, we can't all be judged on our past. As for everyone involved in conceptualizing and voicing Jar Jar, I mean, that was more of a group effort, so we can attack the clan on that one. Or, maybe the clan's leader . . . 

And I've got to say up front. I just hate the name Jar Jar Binks. It seriously sounds like a ratty toy one of the Rugrats would have found in a puddle of mud and they decided to give it the name Jar Jar Binks. 

I hate that name. 

So this movie's weird to me. When I get the Star Wars itch, or there's a new Star Wars movie about to be released, by decree, I have to go back and rewatch all the movies. I have to. It's not an option. And that includes the sequels. And whenever I'm like, ""You know I'm feeling pretty optimistic, maybe the Phantom Menace won't be that bad,"" then I usually come out of the movie pretty disappointed because I was giving the movie a new hope. See what I did there? But if I go into the movie with the attitude of, ""Uuuugh, this is gonna suck worse than going to work at 4:00 AM on Monday morning in the dead of winter. Just kidding, nothing's that bad. Maybe. But then I watch the movie with that attitude, and I'm like, ""Okay, it's not that bad."" I can overlook its flaws, I can appreciate it for what it's trying to do, and I can see the little speckles of gems that are just trying so hard to shine through this rock pile of a movie. 

I'll say this, that one thing helps with watching this movie. Get it in blu ray. I don't know, but for some reason, having a crisper, cleaner version to look at goes a long way in eliminating some of the torture of watching this movie, and it really does help the special effects to stand out as they should. And even after twenty years, the effects do look pretty good even today. 

And I love the creature and droid designs in this movie. The big fish in that Gungan lake, totally unnecessary to the story, but I'm still glad they're there. Because on the outside, it's just an ordinary lake that you'd go splashing around in at summer camp. Might even put in a slide and the blob. But you never know what's lurking just below the surface . . .  Like, I love that shit. 

And say what you will about the advancement of technology in relation to the timeline of the two trilogies, but those droidekas are bad. Ass. I want more of those. I want those to replace bodyguards in real life. Hell, I want one of those to replace Kevin Kostner in THE Bodyguard, and we'd have a much better movie. 

And I actually really do love just about any scene with Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. They're seasoned actors who bring talent onscreen. I think their chemistry is a bit jilted by possibly the directing, and having to be conformed in what a boring-ass Jedi relationship would be, but still, they themselves and their story arc bring the most interesting scenes to the table here. 

Like, this is the movie where we get to see a day in the life of a Jedi, where they're protecting the queen, and I love that stuff. Like, that's what a jedi would be doing. 

And of course Darth Maul is great. We just don't get much of him, and that feels a little bit like a cheat. Is it a cheat, or is it now standard practice within the Star Wars universe? You know, show us this really badass villain, then kill him before they have their chance to shine. 

Instead, let's focus all our attention on someone who shouldn't shine. Someone who shouldn't even exist. And that's (say it with me children) Jar Jar Binks. I don't want to dwell too much on him, because then it's like we're giving the bad kid in class too much attention, which is exactly what he wants. But watching this movie, I realized, The Phantom Menace would actually be a decently good movie if they just took out Jar Jar. 

You hear that, George Lucas? How's about you release a special edition where you cut that gunga out of the movie instead of making Greedo shoot first? 

I'm just saying. 

Even if he didn't talk, it would improve the movie by so much in my book, because he says things that just don't matter, and he never ever shuts up, and I'm taken out of the movie and tempted to press mute, or skip to a scene without him in it. 

There's my piece on Jar Jar. I've said it. It's over, it's done. 

Now. 

Jake Lloyd. Let me first say that I don't blame anything on Jake Lloyd. 

It's not your fault. It's not your fault. Jake. It's not your fault. I mean, the kid was just doing what he was told. 

I blame his parents for taking him to the audition. I blame the casting department. And I blame George Lucas for not demanding more of him. I don't know, maybe he just didn't have it in him to push a kid that hard, and deep down, ol' George is just a soft little Eewok. 

It's just so disturbing to think that somewhere out there, a little boy, the perfect Anikin Skywalker is out there, never knowing fame, because the casting director didn't do their job right. You could even say, it's a disturbance in the force. A missed opportunity for the universe. 

If Jar Jar makes it feel like I'm watching a Saturday morning cartoon, then Jake Lloyd makes it feel like I'm watching a low budget amateur YouTube series. 

At one point, Qui Gon Jin is like, ""There's something about this boy."" There sure is, Qui Gon. There sure is. 

I remember thinking for years that the pod racing scene is like almost a half hour long, because it does tend to drag on forever. But this time watching it, I timed it, from the start of the race to the finish, and it clocks in at just ten minutes. Who'd have known? 

And as for all the taxation and senate stuff . . . I was surprised at how little screen time even that took up. It's just unnecessary technobabble that reassures the viewers that you're not watching a little kids' movie. Or is it? 

One thing I will say, is that George Lucas told the story he wanted to tell, and he did it boldly, with heels dug deep. It never feels like the actual story is waffling, not really knowing where it wants to go. It has a definite start, it knows its course, and it sticks to it until the designated finish. So well, done, Mr. Lucas. I commend you. 

Now whether we agree with the story that was told, that's a different subject altogether. Personally, I would have preferred to jump into this trilogy finding Anikin as a teenager, or even let this movie just be about Obiwan's training, and then we don't see Anikin until the end. I just don't think it's necessary to see Darth Vader as a little kid. I understand this is Lucas's way of getting us to sympathize with his eventual downfall, but there are much better ways to accomplish that. 

I honesty don't think this movie is necessary outside of, ""Oh, I get to watch an extra two and a half hours of Star Wars for my Star Wars marathon."" I wanted an Episode 1, but not this episode one. I will say, that if they had cut out Jar Jar or replaced Jake Lloyd – if they'd done just one of those things – this would have been a much, much better movie. But they wanted to have it both ways, and the movie, and the Star Wars saga, suffers for it. 

I'll be ranking the theatrical released Star Wars movies throughout this series, and since this is the first SW movie I've reviewed, it gets to hold the spot for number one on my list. But not for long . . . 

We'll see. Attack of the Clones might replace it next week. Or it might not. I can never remember which one is worse. Or better. 

It won't be until I get to Revenge of the Sith until the competition actually starts. 
"
"Oct 20, 2019",5,Thought it was great
"Oct 20, 2019",2.5,"Its alright, great end battle but everything else feels stale and drawn out"
"Oct 19, 2019",3.5,"At first I didn’t like this one, but then I watched it again leading up to episode 9 and it’s a lot better than I remembered. It’s fun and sometimes keeps a good emotional tone. Overall, it has absolutely nothing one 4,5, and 6 but it’s fine for what it is. Definitely doesn’t deserve all the hate."
"Oct 18, 2019",2,"Oh where do I start with this movie? While there is a lot of take there is also some give in the movie. I would like to point out the bad first, then the good. Like I said, there's a lot of give and take. The direction that George Lucas gives the movie has a very slick style. Not a lot of grime and dirt that the original has. The look is just very polished. Speaking of the look I wanna talk about the special affects. Let me just say the obvious, they are everywhere. Even when there doesn't need to be. For example you could've had the pod racers practice when they're just sitting in the cockpit. But at the same time, the movie did evolve CGI. They developed the first CG character. Even though the comedy of the said character did fall in his face. There's also some bad puppetry like those racist politic aliens had. Also the villain, Darth Maul, doesn't really have a lot of character. He just looks cool and wants to reveal himself to the Jedi. Take that out of context from the movie or in, that doesn't make a difference. Now the good, I think Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi was a perfect choice. Also the action is a lot of fun from the beginning. But it can be very scarce with the political dialogue. Which I almost forgot to mention is that there isn't a lot of character driven dialogue. It's very expository. But there is one line which could be used for a lot of occasions, ""the ability to speak doesn't make you intelligent"". Another thing is that Ian McDermid is really captivating as the chancellor. Even though he doesn't have a lot of screen time. Lastly I want to talk about two scenes, those are the pod race scene is pretty engaging. But it uses the same shots, pan from left to right and POV shots. Also the final fight scene has too much going on. The fight between Obi Wan, Qui Gon and Maul is really good and the choreography is excellent. Also you do feel what Obi Wan feels when Qui Gon dies. It's a really touching scene. Now on to the second thing which is the fight between the Gungans and the droids is fine popcorn fun, but has annoying slap stick. But the Doughnut station is so unnecessary. It's just filler for the sake of filler and they didn't know what to do with Annie during that battle. All in all the Phantom Menace, while it's fine for what it is, is disappointing. The only reason I would watch it is if I was marathoning the Star Wars Saga. "
"Oct 16, 2019",3.5,"Great movie, definitely had things about it I wasn't crazy about but so does every Star Wars movie. Loved the Darth Maul scenes, young Anakin was great, Jar Jar is fine, didn't like that C3PO was in it but whatever, I loved the Midichlorians! Liam Neeson did awesome, liked that character, didn't like that R2 was in, its implausible that these droids would be coincidentally through all of Star Wars. Overall good movie though. "
"Oct 15, 2019",2.5,"You know, my dad likes this movie because of the scenery and the graphics."
"Oct 14, 2019",4.5,"This movie has definitely aged well, especially in light of what Disney has done with the sequel trilogy. Seeing such a bright, optimistic young boy who will one day become Vader... it's mesmerizing if you keep this in mind the whole time. I've even made room in my heart for ol' Jar Jar, who is a lighter story element meant to counterbalance the somewhat tedious plot. Ahmed Best really sells that performance. The Force is strong with this initial prequel entry."
"Oct 14, 2019",5,love this movie and prequels so under rated great special effect revolutionary CGI for the time which still holds up very well great story great characters very good acting and leagues better than the Disney star wars so much to love so much to enjoy.
"Oct 10, 2019",0.5,Too much walking and talking
"Oct 09, 2019",3.5,Nowhere near as bad as the last couple of films. I actually liked this one. At least they were actually doing stunts. Jar jar was not annoying to me at all. I'd take him over the annoying cast we got today. 
"Oct 06, 2019",2,Nostalgic crap. Jar Jar was by far the best character.
"Oct 06, 2019",3,Blame Jar Jar for why people hate this film
"Oct 04, 2019",3,"There's a lot to hate, but there's also a lot to love"
"Sep 29, 2019",3.5,this movie is not a very good Star Wars movie. But is still a good movie if you forget it is a Star Wars movie. it focus too much on politics. Which you don't want in a Star Wars movie but if you just focus on the battle's you will have a good time
"Sep 29, 2019",5,"one of the best installments of the saga, with one of the most epic laser saber duels and one of the most credible sith, darth maul."
"Sep 28, 2019",3.5,"I used to complain about the Star Wars prequels and I'll admit they still have their strong flaws. To name a couple flaws in this film Jar jar sucked and at times the acting was cringy. However compared to the sequels these are ""good"" Star Wars movies and I'd recommend watching them for the full Star Wars experience."
"Sep 28, 2019",3.5,Some of the best visual effects and most unerable moments by jar-jar but least it's the a good Star Wars pre-queal.
"Sep 27, 2019",1,"Truly rotten. Really, does anyone like this movie?"
"Sep 26, 2019",5,Jar Jar is hilarious 
"Sep 23, 2019",3.5,"Although, it's a bit rough. It's a well needed story to explain the origin of our beloved characters, Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker. Definitely recommend this film."
"Sep 23, 2019",4,Darth Maul is CRIMINALLY underused
"Sep 21, 2019",0.5,When this first came out I was so excited to go and watch it but when I got half way through and Realised that I could've gone to sleep at home instead. It was really terrible and if you love Star Wars please stay from this episode. Furthermore it really is trash from the bottom of the bin. If you have a copy on dvd or vhs it would make an excellent frisbee and nothing more. If I find a copy in my collection I would burn it because it is a massive waste of time. 
"Sep 20, 2019",2.5,"Not the horrifying monster everyone remembers it to be. Mediocre , but that final duel . Come on. "
"Sep 18, 2019",2.5,Dry and very slow.   Graphics were very pastel coloured and almost blurry.  Way too much cgi throughout.  
"Sep 18, 2019",4.5,"Yes, it's Target audience is younger kids, but it is still good. Jar Jar is dumb, I'll admit (even though hes probably the real villain) and the CGI is awful, but the story is good, and JAKE LLOYD IS FINE. HE WAS BEING A NINE YEAR OLD. The Darth Maul lightsaber duel is one of the best in the franchise."
"Sep 15, 2019",3.5,"While it is not the strongest film in the Star Wars saga, it doesn't deserve all the negative criticism it gets. Overall it felt ahead of its time in regards of both the political plot element and what it wanted cgi to do. The cgi heavy elements of the film don't really look good from how far the rest of the prequel trilogy goes. There needed to be more politics for the sub plot to really work but I think that this is in part due to not believing the average movie goer would want political intrigue. Seeing how good things like game of thrones or house of cards have portrayed politics I would love to have seen more on the senate. Jar Jar Binks is terrible in every way imaginable but there are some great performances from McGregor, Portman and Neeson. The pod race scene and the duel of fates are iconic. "
"Sep 15, 2019",4,"Underrated, has some great moments"
"Sep 15, 2019",1.5,"Jar Jar Binks is an abomination and makes this film literally unwatchable. However, the Jedi scenes are mostly entertaining."
"Sep 14, 2019",3,"Driving too deeply into messy space politics and not spending too much time on the main conflict of its central characters sinks this prequel movie, but it still stands up as one with a great cast, one of the best scores in filmmaking history, as well as one of the best Star Wars villains of all time in Darth Maul, a feat despite his rather limited screentime."
"Sep 11, 2019",4,"As a child when I saw this in the theatres, after all the hype leading upto it, I loved it! Now re watching 20 years later, I still enjoyed it, but did see a little bit of what the critics said about it, in particular Jar Jar binks. Still though, some of the action scenes and in particular the introduction of the character ""Darth Maul"" were unforgettable and timeless."
"Sep 08, 2019",4,"One of the best stories, one of the worst movies. "
"Sep 08, 2019",2,Darth Maul practically saves this film.
"Sep 08, 2019",5,"Great story good paced movie about state in decline. Jedi order after thousand years become servants to the republic instead of the Force making them lost force sight. Qui Gon was only exception. Epic movie. Too much silly stuff make some part bad, but overall this movie deserve atleast 70%"
"Sep 06, 2019",2.5,thank God for Darth Maul...
"Sep 05, 2019",5,"The ultimate set up film for George Lucas' classic saga of a boy, a girl, and a galaxy as the original trailer stated. Fans and critics pan it yet they forget the premise of the film is to set up all the others. Which is does quite well also complaining about politics and a child friendly character are poor excuses. The story is cohesive the characterization is presented interestingly. Liam Neeson proves why he's such a great leading man. Must see."
"Sep 05, 2019",2.5,Darth Maul was the big selling point in this film. Could have done without the midichlorians-it de-mystified some of the force. 
"Sep 04, 2019",4,The darth maul fight saved this movie for me 
"Sep 04, 2019",2.5,Jar Jar and baby Vader are the worst
"Sep 04, 2019",1.5,Jar jar is a sith lord
"Sep 03, 2019",2.5,"Burdened by exposition and awkward writing and acting, The Phantom Menace is a disappointment — albeit visually interesting — compared to its beloved predecessors"
"Sep 02, 2019",5,"The battle with Qui Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul is such an amazing lightsaber fight."
"Sep 01, 2019",3,decent movie but the worst of the 8 films for sure 
"Aug 26, 2019",4,I dislike the hate this film received because it had some fantastic actors. The soundtrack was phenomenal and beautiful.
"Aug 26, 2019",5,Best episode of the movie
"Aug 21, 2019",5,"Of course characters would act without much emotion since Jedi are paragon type characters and Padme when was Queen she had to remain serious. When Padme play just Padme, she was fine and kid Anakin was never boring. Qui Gon and Obi Wan are never boring just they cannon jump and yell because that is not how Jedi act. Even Luke in ep6 was seroius. Plot was fine and wasn't about trade, but how republic cannot function because of corruption"
"Aug 20, 2019",3,"Burdened by exposition and populated with stock characters, The Phantom Menace gets the Star Wars prequels off to a bumpy -- albeit visually dazzling -- start."
"Aug 19, 2019",2,I do not understand this movie. I just like to imagine Lucas telling all the actors to act with no emotion.
"Aug 18, 2019",3.5,"First time, I saw it, I was disapointed, but it began to build the Saga."
"Aug 17, 2019",1.5,This is a stale boring excuse for a star wars movie with comedy that falls flat and every second scrapes by. The only two parts that are actually good is the end fight and the pod race. But I appreciate the jumps it did for technology 
"Aug 16, 2019",5,"CGI still looks great and will continue to look great. Actors were awesome. Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Ian Mcdiarmid and great story that continue in ep2 and 3. The Phantom Menace serve as excellent fundation for rest of saga. And nothing on this world is more epic that duel of the Fates and soundtrack that go with it."
"Aug 16, 2019",0.5,"As juvenile and off-putting as a wet nappy. Terrible writing, terrible acting and cgi that has aged as well as the career of its star actor. Irredeemable garbage and an insult to fans of Star Wars. In the age of remakes and reboots, how about a remake of this steaming pile? "
"Aug 15, 2019",2.5,"Meh, not that bad. I think it's better than Attack of the Clones but not as good as Revenge of the Sith."
"Aug 13, 2019",5,"Great introduction in to galaxy that is in peace, but started to falling apart. Lucas genius way of telling real world history in fantasy movie because many conflicts started because trade in history. Naboo and Tatooine was great addition to Star Wars galaxy. This movie should have atleast 80% positives reviews."
"Aug 11, 2019",2.5,"Right away, my least favourite of the 8 Skywalker saga movies (I find it hard to rank Rouge One, and I haven't seen Solo.) Most of the movie is just boring nonsense on Tatoonie and Naboo, and don't get me started on the Trade Federation. RUBBISH! Its few redeeming features are 1) Darth Maul, steals every one of the several scenes he is in, just an amazing villian, up there with Darth Vader and Palpatine, 2) That final battle with Maul, thrilling, 3) Yoda's cameo appearance and 4) John William's score. Overall pretty average entertainment for the family."
"Aug 11, 2019",5,"Every Saga have its Beginning.
EPIC!!! I cannot give enough praises to entire PT. Revolution in entire movie industry. Definitely better than OT and only LOTR is better but not by much."
"Aug 10, 2019",5,"Avesome start to awesome adventure.
Along with soundtrack and duel of the fates, i really liked when Padme said that will not play games while her peoples suffer and that she will return ultimately creating plan and defeating Trade Federation in city."
"Aug 10, 2019",5,"Lucas always wanted to tell story and he did it. Great movie. Few nitpicks about too much Jar Jar or that kid Anakin shouldn't be one in fighter. 
Duel of the Fates
Duel with Maul
Podracers
New Galaxy in time of peace in state of falling apart
Jedi at their full strenght( not old guys from obsolete trilogy)
Sith behind scene and Palpatine rise to power. One of best movies ever"
"Aug 08, 2019",0.5,The Phantom Menace is the weakest of the Franchise. It's made for money's sake. 
"Aug 03, 2019",5,"An exciting and entertaining, if a bit underwhelming beginning to the prequels, combined with Lucas's direction and script, the performances of the cast, Williams' score, Tattersall's cinematography, Burtt and Smith's editing, Bocquet's production design, Walpole's set decoration, Biggar's costume design, action sequences and visual effects, The Phantom Menace is an exciting and adventurous blockbuster!!!"
"Aug 02, 2019",1,"An absolute trainwreck. Avoid at all costs. Duel of the Fates and its accompanying lightsaber fight are the only draws. However, I am thankful that this film exists, for we would not have the Mr Plinkett review without it. 2/10"
"Aug 02, 2019",4,Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is a good movie... except for the last part of the movie. I'll explain later. Now Darth Maul is a good villain. However Nute Gunray and Lott Dodd are horrible all they do is talk about the princess signing a freaking decoy but they send their army to do it for them but they don't do anything. Character I hate are Anakin and Padmé. The performance didn't seem good by Jake Lloyd and Padmé is just some random girl that comes out of nowhere and is now the star of the movie. Things I don't like about this movie is they don't introduce the characters well we are just thrown in seeing them with their lightsabers. Another thing I didn't like was why kill Qui-Gon Jinn he was a good character and an amazing performance by Liam Nesson. The last part of this movie just goes down the toilet the freaking aliens are fighting to sign a decoy and the battle is totally stupid you got a kid just in a coincidence destroy the ship. To sum this movie up it is a okay movie not the best but not that bad either I give it a 4 out of 5
"Aug 01, 2019",3.5,It has some good scenes and some boring scenes but in the end it is a good star to the prequel saga
"Aug 01, 2019",2,"One of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen. I remember being so excited for this. Looking back, it does some stuff better than I recalled like CGI, the score, and the action scenes. But it gets bogged down by bad acting, weak pacing, and a muddled plot"
"Jul 31, 2019",3,"I enjoy The Phantom Menace quite a bit more than most people, but it has a ton of flaws. I hate Jar Jar Banks as much as everyone else does, and I believe he is one of the worst Star Wars characters. Jake Lloyd is awful as 9-year-old Anakin, and the plot of the film is too political and very confusing. That being said, I love Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn as well as Ewan McGregor  as a young, youthful Obi-Wan Kenobi. Also, the lightsaber duel with Darth Maul is awesome! B- 65/100"
"Jul 29, 2019",2.5,"Not easy to resume the Star Wars universe; indeed, this movie failed."
"Jul 26, 2019",3,"I am a major Star Wars fan and I can enjoy every movie. But I will say that the phantom Menace is the weakest link in the series. Most of the movie is genuinely enjoyable, it has some of the best sences in the prequel trilogy and darth maul steals the show in every scene he's in. Jar jar does hold the movie back quite a lot but
overall the movie is a watchable movie that can satisfy you if you're in the mood for it."
"Jul 25, 2019",2,Jar Jar Binks couldn't be more annoying if he tried.
"Jul 21, 2019",4.5,"This movie has always been great, granted some Jar Jar scenes weren't that good but everything was amazing, so many iconic memes, duels, and CGI"
"Jul 21, 2019",5,There's always a bigger fish
"Jul 21, 2019",5,One of my favorite movies.
"Jul 21, 2019",4,"Visually astonishing, an exciting spacial adventure."
"Jul 21, 2019",4,"Looking back, this movie isn't all that bad. Saw it when I was 9, and watched it recently. Not great, not terrible."
"Jul 21, 2019",3,It's just an average movie. The prequels are known to be weak and they are.
"Jul 20, 2019",3.5,"This episode is clearly under the precedents but delivers a good first look on the old times that Ben Kenobi told to Luke in SW4. Offering a good sense of nostalgia. The biggest problem of this movie is probably the retcon on the force thing and the acting of a lot of characters. However, it's a decent Star Wars who has a heart and has a decent story to tell. "
"Jul 18, 2019",2.5,"The movie was an average to below average movie with a very good storyline but little character development. It was unclear who the main character was. It was obvious that Obi Wan should have been the main character But they put more focus on an unnecessary gungan. The dialogue is just plain dumb. Though there where some interesting things such as Darth Maul and the Sith coming out of hiding there where just too many flaws. What boosts this movies rating is the ending fight scene between Darth Maul, Obi Wan, and Qui Gon. The scene was nothing short of great and it was filled with suspense. I did enjoy this movie but it wasn't up to par with a Star Wars movie despite having loads of potential to be good. In my opinion this is definitely in the bottom half of Star Wars movies. "
"Jul 15, 2019",3,"The fact that people have said this film is better than what Disney is putting out is something else. Lucas decided to throw out Story for a world building film, which isn't so bad, but in a franchise that prides itself on story, that's a disappointment to me. McGregor does give a stellar performance as Obi-Wan (and I might actually like him more than Alec Guinness) Nesson and Park also give some solid performances, but Lucas's direction feels so odd that sometimes they get lost in the ground. Anakin is a little twerp (which personally is not what I want to see from the future Dark Lord of the Sith) and don't even get me started on Jar Jar Binks. The film isn't all bad, in fact for some it may be a guilty pleasure, the beginning and end are also quite fun to watch (when you're not cringing) but the middle drags on, and feels super boring. The film isn't terrible, but to call it good I'm not sure."
"Jul 14, 2019",0.5,The Young Indiana Jones tv series should have been the warning where this Star Wars film was going to go. Ewan McGregor as always a bad casting decision.
"Jul 13, 2019",0.5,"Pure garbage. Boring, tedious, dull, just painful to watch. The new ones are better by light years. Thank God Disney acquired LucasFilm."
"Jul 13, 2019",4,This movie is not as bad as some perceive 
"Jul 13, 2019",3.5,"The Phantom Menace may be considered the worst of them all when it comes to the SW saga however I disagree, this movie does have it's flaws but it does have enjoyable qualities to it. "
"Jul 12, 2019",4.5,"A great prequel to the whole star wars saga. It sets up many great elements of the lore, expand the universe we know and love, in addition of showing the Jedis and the Republic right before the fall. Aside from a few dumb but forgivable moments (Anakin blowing up the mothership and the path through the core of Naboo, for example), I fell in love with this movie. Some may think the pace is a little too slow as there is a fair share of politics on screen, but it helped me understand the universe better and I love the characters in it. The fight at the end on the sound of Duel of the Fates will probably remain in my memory as the greatest fight in Star Wars in terms of tension and choregraphy."
"Jul 11, 2019",5,"It is actually my favorite Star Wars movie, and thus makes it my favorite movie of all time. It is not a bad movie. Jar Jar isn't a horrible character, and there is an awesome lightsaber duel."
"Jul 08, 2019",5,Thank God that Star Wars ep1-3 don't rehash OT obsolete stuff. This is better movie than any of OT. This movie was needed far more than OT because its actually built universe not leaving everything in dark like OT
"Jul 08, 2019",2,Fans sensed a great disturbance in the force...
"Jul 07, 2019",5,I really like this movie. the best parts are the music and the lightsaber fights
"Jul 03, 2019",5,Great start of awesome story. Beginning of Palpatine rise to power that will end with republic turn in empire from inside. Epic duel and soundtrack plus many new cultures and wider universe. Tatooine was excellent and thank Lucas for story he always wanted to tell
"Jul 03, 2019",4,"A visual masterpiece with a political story and some stunning action. Some bad acting, plot that is unspecific to the franchise, predictability and pacing issues will deter from the full enjoyment though"
"Jun 21, 2019",4.5,"While I can't help but notice the amount of cracks The Phantom Menace has, such as the clunky dialogue, wooden acting, and CGI that didn't age well at all, I always turn into that six year-old kid immune to such flaws every time I watch it — even now as a grown adult."
"Jun 17, 2019",3,"The return to the galaxy far far away is welcome, but the cringeworthy comic relief ruins what could have been another great Star Wars film."
"Jun 11, 2019",4,I don't see why people don't like this movie because I think it's almost as good as the originals.
"Jun 11, 2019",2.5,A big down as far as the series goes 
"Jun 06, 2019",5,Legendary movie! And thankfully disney cannot ruined it.
"Jun 05, 2019",0.5,"It hurts me emotionally to watch this movie. I am scarred for life at how bad it is. Please, please, Disney, please remake this movie - actually, remake all 3 of the prequels, and turn them into something other than a steaming pile of Bantha Poo-doo. I'm begging you."
"Jun 04, 2019",4,"Seeing a lot of adults giving their opinion on this movie based on how they *think* it would have been received by kids. This movie was released just before I was born and I watched it when I was a child and I loved it. I do have the common sense to admit that it is stodgy in parts and sometimes makes little sense, but the same can be said for all Star Wars movies. This one is not significantly worse than any of the others and deserves a better rating."
"Jun 03, 2019",5,Epic movie with epic soundtrack.
"Jun 01, 2019",5,Best paced of all SW movieswith awesome ending
"Jun 01, 2019",3.5,The Phantom Menace has it's flaws but inspite of them I enjoy watching it
"May 31, 2019",5,From epic Duel of the Fates fight and score to incredible worldbuilding and cracks of republic from inside thatnks to Sith.
"May 30, 2019",5,One of the most entertaining Star Wars films ever made. This film creates a much larger and complex galaxy that the originals did not accomplish. It adds elements of a real culture between the podracing and trade negotiations. It also creates some exciting action with the lightsaber duels and droid battles.
"May 28, 2019",3,"Don't get me wrong, this movie had some flaws, but it was a good movie. Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson's performances were pretty good and some of the CGI was some what decent in some parts (Pod racing scene), but there was some things that didn't make people happy. The CGI for Jar Jar Binks was really bad, didn't even make it look like he was really standing there, just copied and pasted him right in. And the little boy that played Anakin was not to par with me, he seems like a ""robot"" to me.
"
"May 23, 2019",0.5,Episodes 1-3 should be remade.
"May 22, 2019",5,"I think the biggest criticism of the prequel trilogy is that it was not like the older movies and was too childish and goofy. What these older fans also don't realize, is that this prequel trilogy was meant for kids. Growing up with this as a childhood favorite, I can speak that all kids I knew at the time enjoyed this movie. I believe it will be looked at better overtime as the younger generation gets older and more and more kids get to experience it the right way-from a child's point of view."
"May 21, 2019",1.5,"Young children will probably enjoy The Phantom Menace, but ultimately, when you compare it to the original trilogy, everything about TPM is awful. New canon is terrible, old canon is trampled upon, and let's be honest, no one wants to watch a space opera film just to be mired down with politics involving an incompetent bureaucracy."
"May 20, 2019",4,Much hate has been given to the Star Wars prequels but The Phantom Menace did give us a proper beginning for the greatest villain in film history...Darth Vader. Jake Lloyd plays Anakin Skywalker with a slyness which predicts his downfall and corruption leading to the darkside. Fanboys may not get it...try reading Joseph Campbell.
"May 20, 2019",5,A spectacular beginning to the saga!
"May 20, 2019",4.5,Star wars is sciece-fiction movie. Star Wars is set on a galaxi. This movie is a fight betwem rebels and empire.
"May 19, 2019",5,"Not sure why people rag on this movie so much, yes it had its flaws but it was still a movie with a lot of neat concepts going on. Way better than the junk Disney gives us.

1) Actual Aliens
2) Podracing
3) Duel between Darth Maul
4) Naboo and Otah Gunga
5) Battle Droids and Destroyer Droids
6) Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman

Just a few things which were amazing with the film, not sure why theres so much hate plus George Lucas directed it. As far as Im concerned this is absolute gold and always will be compared to the terrible crap that we have to watch right now like the Last Jedi."
"May 19, 2019",4.5,People are overreacting when jar jar comes up
"May 19, 2019",5,"Story about how Rebuplic has fallen into corruption and cannot solve problems because of said corruption to Jedi Order that was offended by possibilty of Sith return.
Qui Gon as paragon type character and his student who are is conflict because of Jedi order. Palpatine masterfully create crisis with his pawns Trade Federation and he manage to be elected to be chancellor which was first step of his plan. Soundtrack is among best ever and lightsaber duel was best and only ep3 tops it.
Finally we  saw universe where technology is not like that bucket millenium falcon. Its good to see new vehicles and new species and new technology."
"May 12, 2019",2,The movie has a great cast and great charcters with the exception of some and is a prequel to what is quite possibly the greatest saga of all time and completely ruins it by giving us great actors such as Liam neeson and Ewan McGregor and somehow making them deliver terrible performances and giving us dialogue sounding like it was written by a toddler and a boring movie in conclusion 4/10
"May 09, 2019",4.5,It the Good Star Wars franchise ever... I felt like a kid when this movie came out in theater.
"May 09, 2019",4,All good except the pod racing scene.
"May 07, 2019",4,Great film with a lot of fun and interesting world building on how things use to be before the empire.
"May 05, 2019",3.5,"An underrated film by all. Amazing cast and interesting plot. as a film that wasn't Star Wars this would be great but as a Star Wars film it lacks the ""Star Wars Magic"""
"May 05, 2019",0.5,terrible - just terrible
"May 04, 2019",1,"Look, this isn't the worst movie ever. I wouldn't even say it's... terrible. But this is still a really bad movie. The crappy effects, the dull writing and direction, and the ungodly pace are the main things that make me want to sink The Phantom Menace deep into the Naboo Abyss."
"May 04, 2019",1.5,"This is now the 10th time I've seen Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace and sadly I can't even say that it's a third as good as Episode IV: A New Hope.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is the 4th Star Wars film and the 1st Star Wars prequel. The film was directed by George Lucas who also directed Episode IV: A New Hope. The film stars Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn.

The acting was just plain bad from the emotion to the dialogue delivery. Now A New Hope may not have the best acting ever, but at least it was confident. The only person in my opinion that did a good job was Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn. 

The characters are bad for the most part especially the Devil himself Jar Jar Binks, but I do have to say that a couple characters like Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn I did enjoy to watch on the big screen.

The cinematography was steady with a couple cool shots of the characters and scenery, but nothing that special.

The settings were mixed for me because I did like a couple of the destinations, but I have to say that most of the planets were either rehashes from the original trilogy or just very bland.

The set designs and props were strong, but sadly the film tries to use special effects over the practical effects.

The film in my opinion also has some good costume design especially with the Jedi and Sith.

The special effects in my opinion are very dated and really distract from the film. Personally I think that George Lucas should have stuck with the puppets.

The action wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily good either. The Lightsaber fights were entertaining, but whenever it would involve the droids or ships it would just drag on.

The music was definitely the best thing within the film especially the song Duel of the Fates. Personally I think that John Williams is one of the greatest conductors of all time.

The story in my opinion felt off throughout the runtime of the film, but I want to say that I'm not against the idea of making a prequel to Star Wars if done properly.

The comedy was one of the most annoying things within the film especially with the character Jar Jar Binks. Every time Jar Jar Binks did something ï¿ 1/2~comical' I just wanted to turn off the TV and go outside.

The film also had some very interesting  ideas, but sadly they were executed wrongly.

The film is also quiet boring and hard to get through. Plus In my opinion I felt that it wasn't even a Star Wars film until the very end.

Over all I give it a 
3/10
32%
1.6/5

Darth Maul was cool, but not enough to change my mind on the film."
"May 03, 2019",2,"Ugh this movie has a few great ideas but many, many awful ideas that drag it down sooooo much. Great ideas are Darth Maul and Qui Gon Jinn. Qui Gon is a very interesting character and was incredibly likable and has always been one of my favorite characters in the saga. Darth Maul is maybe the coolest villain in film history, the design, the weapon, everything about him is just great. However, Darth Maul gets only one good scene in the whole movie and is very underutilized. Now the bad ideas include using CGI on NEARLY EVERY SHOT in the movie, there is literally only ONE shot in the whole movie without CGI. The pod racing concept sounds kinda cool but it's somehow extremely boring. Another terrible idea is the Gungans, I don't need to elaborate on that I think everyone knows why the Gungans are awful. Overall this movie isn't very important to the franchise and isn't really worth your time."
"Apr 29, 2019",4.5,"Not all too bad, it's kind of good! The only part of the movie that Kim dog ruined it was the long and extended pod race. However, great start to the franchise!"
"Apr 27, 2019",2.5,"John Williams' score carries this film on its back. The writing and directing are just not there for most of the film. The way characters speak is boring, the only exceptions are Liam Nesson and Ewan Mcgregor's performances. Its ending sequence is the best part of the film by far but it's mostly due to score and choreography."
"Apr 26, 2019",3,"Episode I is a mildly enjoyable movie held back by dated effects and less than stellar writing, problems that would plague the other two movies in the underwhelming prequel trilogy. All in all, TPM is a decent movie that in hindsight is rather inconsequential to the rest of the saga. "
"Apr 25, 2019",5,Awesome and absolute star wars
"Apr 20, 2019",3.5,"Underrated for It's brilliant plot, adventure, and cinematography. Obi wan was pretty much the only character who developed, but that does not make any of the other ones any less interesting. Felt the most like the original trilogy out of any other Post 80s star wars movie, to this day."
"Apr 19, 2019",5,I think the prequels are great.
"Apr 19, 2019",3,"What we really lack here in Episode 1 are interesting and relatable characters. Here we have NO Han, No Leia and No Luke. 
We do have Darth Maul, arguably this trilogies version of Darth Vader. Maul is younger and far more physical, giving us arguably one of the best lightsaber battles of the saga (its at least in top3).
Phantom Menace is often said to be boring and lacking a good plot. 
My feeling is that Episode 1 is setting the overall story of the saga in motion. The important plot point in the movie is basically Sidious using the Trade Federation to cause a crisis and in the process creating a situation that causes the Republic to lose faith in Valorum, the current Chancellor, to set in motion his master plan to become Chancellorn of which works beautifully. Thats the plot that matters most, and not particularly violent enough for some fans it seems.
 
Phantom Menace is actually pretty fun at times and it rarely drags too much, although I admit it does occasionally.
Phantom Menace is  very much a visual film which doesn't really let the audience get to know very much about any one  character.
Anakin here is a young ten year old boy. This is fine but also means the part has to be recast for the next movie, meaning the audience dont connect with the performer in the way they would with Luke/Hamill over three movies. The fun in a film franchise is also in seeing the actors change and and evolve with their characters. 

This film is an OK film. It will only appeal to Star Wars fans first and foremost, in most cases. This film will Im sure develop a sort of cult status in years to come as its totally unfairly maligned."
"Apr 17, 2019",2,in hindsight it is pretty fun to watch as a kid. as an adult it is okayish.
"Apr 16, 2019",0.5,"Huge disappointment, with a laughably bad plot, dialogue, characters"
"Apr 15, 2019",2.5,Even better than episode 2. This is all you would expect from the origins of the galactic war. Entertaining but hard to ignore the terrible humor. Thats what gives this review the score it has.
"Apr 13, 2019",3,Duel of the Fates. Do I have to say more?
"Apr 12, 2019",5,dont understand the hate i can watch this over and over
"Apr 11, 2019",5,Very creative film. I love it
"Apr 06, 2019",3,"Not bad.  A fun day at the theater with the family, or in front of the television.  Terrible acting by the kid."
"Mar 31, 2019",1.5,"The great failure of this movie is its obsession with gimmicks, quirks, and spectacle while failing to tell a engaging story or deliver interesting characters. The only good things about this movie are Natalie Portman's acting and the creative inventiveness of the vehicles, costuming, and locations. However, it also fails to deliver a lasting visual palate - a trademark of the original trilogy. It's possibly the single greatest example of the failures of corporate filmmaking in the early digital era."
"Mar 31, 2019",4.5,"It had some pacing issues and oddities, but the new Jedi, the start of the Anakin saga, the pod-racing and the duel between Darth Maul and the Jedi made it an exciting movie to see."
"Mar 29, 2019",4.5,i seen better but the new this is a master piece
"Mar 22, 2019",1,This movie is the definition of a massive disappointment. It's hard to believe that we went from fantastic movies like Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back to a terrible movie like this. What happened? Almost nothing works about this movie. Grade: D
"Mar 17, 2019",3.5,then ending light sabre battles makes up for the rest of the movie
"Mar 17, 2019",3.5,"Against popular opinion, The Phantom Menace is my favorite prequel film. Despite Jar Jar and young Anakin, it is less cartoony and more reminiscent of the original trilogy. It has one of the best lightsaber battles against a great villain. Some fan-edits help smooth its rough edges."
"Mar 15, 2019",2.5,Sceneggiatura banale. Recitazione appena passabile. Scenografia e regia discrete. Il tutto condito da una colonna sonora di J. Williams ottima. Voto: 7 (meritato in maggioranza dalla colonna sonora)
"Mar 13, 2019",5,This Movie is Amazing
"Mar 12, 2019",2,"Rewatched it a couple of nights ago and itï¿ 1/2(TM)s still as dull and as boring as it was the first time I watched it. Liked the last 20 minutes or so, though...."
"Mar 11, 2019",5,"I was 14 when I first saw this movie in the cinema, I Loved it then and i still do now!"
"Mar 09, 2019",3.5,"La amenaza fantasma es una historia que dista mucho de la trilogÃ­a original de Star War por allÃ­ en los 80's. Sin embargo, tiene la esencia pura de la saga pero a la vez fresca por que nos trae aventuras nuevas asÃ­ formando en si su propia identidad. 
Erra mucho en sobrecargar el filme de personajes secundarios que distraen y te hacen seguir el hilo de la historia pero llegan a ser tediosos y olvidables en muchos casos. 
Se rescata el gran cast principal de la pelÃ­cula contando con grandes personajes como Kenobi, Anakin, Padme y Qui Gon. 
No abusa del fan service, de hecho, sabe muy bien como usarlo dentro de la historia para que no se sienta forzado. 

Al final... es una historia reconfortante, aventurera, nostÃ¡lgica y que por momentos puede pegar lo tedioso para mal. Bastante aceptable."
"Mar 09, 2019",2,This was the worst Star Wars movie until Episode 7 and 8 came out. Child Anakin Skywalker is very annoying. I actually found Jarjar Binks endearing rather than annoying unlike most people.
"Mar 09, 2019",2,Great music! That is the only major thing this turd gets right...
"Mar 06, 2019",4.5,"If you just take out Jar Jar Binks, then the film is gold. This film's only problem is Jar Jar. While the kids will find him funny (I did when I was a kid, and stil do) he is a bit extra. Take him out and you've got a story about a wise Jedi Maverick who frees a child slave so he can live out his dream of being a Jedi, as well as Qui-Gon's belief that he is the Chosen One. Then, just sprinkle in a bit of beef with the Jedi Council, and the return of the Sith, and you got yourself gold."
"Mar 04, 2019",5,I really enjoyed it.
"Mar 02, 2019",2,ideas good but done very poor
"Feb 28, 2019",4,"With the exception of JarJar Binks, the movie was very entertaining."
"Feb 27, 2019",3,"The Phantom Menace did at least have some entertainment value. It still had a script that was quite scatterbrained and an alternate atmosphere that divided not just the look and feel of Star Wars, but also the fans."
"Feb 27, 2019",5,"Me encanto el universo de George Lucas, muestra algo que nunca habiamos visto."
"Feb 26, 2019",4,A bit campy but my god it's a star wars movie and looking back we were too hard it it. It's a fun romp and highlights the transformation Anakin went through to become Dark Vader.
"Feb 26, 2019",4.5,"Loved this movie, yes yes including the midichlorians :)"
"Feb 26, 2019",3,Is this movie the best Star Wars movie? NO! Is it bad? this was the first Star Wars movie I ever saw and was the movie that made me a fan in the first place. Now looking back I can see the problems some people but overall the good overshadows the bad. While the CG looks dated the worlds and aliens are very imaginative and interesting. And the world building is pretty solid. Overall while this movie is not my favorite SW movie it still holds a special place in my heart.
"Feb 26, 2019",1,"I was going to give this one half a star, but The Last Jedi made this one look like Citizen Kane, so I had to bump it up to a full star.  Don't get me wrong; the movie is still a steaming pile of bantha poodoo.  And to all those ignorant little kids who thought Darth Maul was just soooooo great!.... the guy didn't last one full movie, kids.  He was a Sith lord wannabe.  Vader got six films and deserves your respect and admiration.  Maul just deserves to be swept into a bottomless pit and forgotten.  Hell, even George thought so since he did it himself in the film =)"
"Feb 26, 2019",5,Better that all new saga
"Feb 26, 2019",3,The Star Wars prequel trilogy starts off with a rotten entry.
"Feb 26, 2019",5,Best movie ever compared to TLJ.
"Feb 25, 2019",1.5,"Only better than Attack of the Clones, Phantom Menace sees George Lucas struggles to deliver an entertaining ride, boring the audience with politics and offensive stereotypes when it should be giving fans more moments like the Darth Maul duel and Pod Race."
"Feb 25, 2019",5,I love this movie. It is one of my favorites.
"Feb 25, 2019",5,Best lightsaber fight around
"Feb 24, 2019",5,"A film I watched repeatedly, and my favorite film of all time until I watched Kick-Ass.  Perfect casting, characters, performances, special effects, score, and pacing; a nearly flawless film, and very enjoyable to watch."
"Feb 24, 2019",3,First act boring. Full of characters from original trilogy.
"Feb 23, 2019",4.5,"I actually liked this one, I think Jake was railroaded on this as his acting wasn't as bad as people make out there is also a directorial issue here as well, I believe this is the first Star Wars movie I can remember seeing, I believe I may have watched the Original three with my dad but can't remember it."
"Feb 23, 2019",5,"One of the better Star Wars movies. Not only did it provide memes, but it started one of the best character arc with Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi. "
"Feb 22, 2019",5,"What a movie show. Props to Liam Neeson - sad he had to go! Darth Maul, half the man he used to be! (Spoilers)"
"Feb 22, 2019",5,Compared to episodes 7 and 8 this movie is a masterpiece.
"Feb 22, 2019",5,This movie is an instant classic and people will continue to rewatch this movie until the end of time.
"Feb 22, 2019",5,This is getting out of control.
"Feb 22, 2019",5,"Highly underated refelction of the failings of democracy in the mid 20th century. An intense thriller with morally complex heroes, an altruistic cult influencing the political theatre, and an iconic shadowy assassin."
"Feb 20, 2019",5,It's george lucas' star wars. What more to say.
"Feb 20, 2019",5,This is my favorite Star Wars of all time
"Feb 20, 2019",4,Isn't so bad now when you compare it to the last jedi.
"Feb 19, 2019",4,"Yes the scenes with young Anakin are boring, yes Jar Jar Binks is in this movie, but it still feels like a Star Wars movie, with the amazing lightsaber fight, and the Naboo airships flying into the trade federations ship. That just puts a good feeling in my heart"
"Feb 19, 2019",4.5,Star Wars still has imagination to spare.
"Feb 18, 2019",5,2nd best Star Wars movie to date
"Feb 17, 2019",4,If your willing to look past jar jar blinks this movie is a great one. Could have been better though
"Feb 17, 2019",4,The entry of a new generation with explosive action great actors for most and one of the best Liam Nesson Movie
"Feb 14, 2019",4,"It had tension, wonderful art designs, a story of survival and deception, and Darth maul!! ...but jar Jar binks was a poor addition to garner comedy"
"Feb 12, 2019",2.5,"Lame and even annoying characters, bland and forgettable dialogue, and unnecessary plot points all add up to make this an iconic bad film. Half of me loves this film and thinks it's an essential film to see just to learn how bad a film can be when a director has complete control of his project. Still yes, a bad film that is well deserved of its reputation."
"Feb 11, 2019",3,Not terrible like Attack of the Clones but still bad.
"Feb 08, 2019",2.5,"Not really any need for this movie.  This should be regarded as a historical appendix, more of a visual encyclopaedia entry than a movie in its own right.  Technically acceptable and doesn't break lore/canon, otherwise it would receive a lower score than 2.5"
"Feb 08, 2019",4,"Stars wars : Episode 1 the Phantom menace , kicks off the Stars wars prequel trilogy with a somewhat slow start but an amazing tale to behold and some background to how it all began "
"Feb 08, 2019",5,"Fantastic movie, only the empire would want to see it fail. I think itï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s aged very well. At first Iï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)m sure all the nostalgic movie goers were upset about the premise at first but now this movie is a very important corner stone for the whole franchise."
"Feb 08, 2019",5,"One word: Qui-Gon. One of the best characters in the whole saga. Peaceful and wise. That by itself is enough.

The movie also expands the universe and understanding in the right direction. Great work!"
"Feb 07, 2019",3.5,"quite a goofy movie looking back, but still entertaining
acting could have been better
graphics dont hold up very well
sound effects were great"
"Feb 06, 2019",2.5,"One name, Jar Jar Binks. Ouch. To large of a part for way to much of the film."
"Feb 04, 2019",5,great movie underrated
"Jan 27, 2019",2,"So boring, I fell asleep talking about."
"Jan 26, 2019",3,"Now, I'm not saying this is the worst Star Wars movie, but it is better than The Last Jedi. Sorry Rian, but it's true and the fans know it. I'd rather listen to Jar Jar talk than listen to the ""jokes"" we had to put up with in TLJ. Anyway, the movie was good, but not good enough to restart the Star Wars franchise."
"Jan 26, 2019",4,"I liked this one, I know everyone hates it but whatever I grew up watching this "
"Jan 24, 2019",3.5,I kinda like it. It is cheesy but it has very cool fight and moments. It may disappoint at certain points but the galaxy has ever seen bigger before.
"Jan 23, 2019",3,Fun movie with some pacing issues. JarJar is far less annoying than I remembered him to be and all the other characters making fun of him is actually funny.
"Jan 22, 2019",3.5,"If it were not for Duel of the Fates playing while the most iconic lightsaber duel took place, this movie would be significantly worse. This film laid groundwork for the subsequent Prequels, exploring the Republic in familiar locations. This movie misses the mark at points, but makes up for it in creating one of the greatest Star Wars moments."
"Jan 21, 2019",3,"Mesmo sendo um dos filmes que mais assisti em toda minha vida, considero-o um filme fraco, o pior das duas trilogias. As cenas envolvendo polÃ­tica e seus diÃ¡logos sobre este mesmo tema chegam a ser massantes, desviando-se da trilogia original, muito mais focada nos conflitos (aÃ§Ã£o) e, atÃ (C) certo ponto, nas relaÃ§Ãµes entre os personagens. Entretanto, Ã (C) impossÃ­vel nÃ£o considerar o filme um mal necessÃ¡rio, jÃ¡ que ele consegue demonstrar os conflitos polÃ­tico-sociais que envolvia a galÃ¡xia. Por fim, as excelentes cenas de aÃ§Ã£o, como as Corridas de Pods e a batalha entre Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn e Obi-Wan Kenobi, fazem o esforÃ§o valer a pena."
"Jan 19, 2019",3.5,"Really love this movie, and yea it could have done without certain things like Jar Jar, but ever since he was introduced itâ(TM)s like a meme I wouldnâ(TM)t want to live without. So in a way Iâ(TM)m glad Jar Jar was there. Loved Qui Gon and Obi Wan, loves Darth Maul, and it was a great way to portray things prior to the empire and how a small dispute was the beginning of a larger means for Palpatine to rise to power.  A lot of thought went into this movie and really sets up a story for the next films that has a solid story arc.  So aside from some of the things that werenâ(TM)t delivered great, it was a great movie that is important to the rest of the saga."
"Jan 18, 2019",1.5,"Stilted characters, boring trade disputes, and character as bland as burnt toast. The Phantom Menace is the beginning of the long and arduous downfall for the Star Wars series. With an overbloated budget and a momentous cast and crew of talent Lucas and Co. create one of the most disapointing returns for a franchise in movie history. Besides the spectacular podrace scene and gorgeous backdrops, Episode 1 misses the mark on everything else."
"Jan 15, 2019",5,"A great movie, Darth Maul is one of the best characters to come around in a long time. Does not get enough credit for what this movie did for a new generation of fans. This is to them what A New Hope was to the older generation"
"Jan 15, 2019",3.5,"A fun flick that has always warmed my heart. I love it, but maybe that is just because of how much of a fan I am for the franchise?"
"Jan 15, 2019",3.5,Would watch this over the Last Jedi any day. Masterpiece compared to Rian's garbage story.
"Jan 13, 2019",4,"I don't understand why this movie has such bad reviews. I like EPISODE I just because of the fact that it's different. George Lucus offres a whole new view of the STAR WARS universe with a new hero, a new story and dazzling visual effects!
A lot of fans argue that the dialogue is terrible and that the acting is bad, and I agree. But  at the same time, I would like to point out that STAR WARS was never well-known for its outstanding acting or its sophisticated dialogue. The story and the effects are the important  factors, and THE PHANTOM MENACE delivers. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are on top form. Darth Maul is just so fricking awesome. Not disappointed at all."
"Jan 12, 2019",1.5,"This was actually the last Star Wars movie I paid to see on the big screen, which makes me a Star Wars hipster who gave up on SW before it was cool to do so - Suck it TLJ anti-fans! :-P

The writing was bad. I actually had a moment of huge personal inspiration 10 minutes into the movie when I released if dialogue like this could be made into a movie I still had a chance to have my own personal writing career.

The Pod Race was fun. The end was 'let's attack the giant space station thing' cause the viewers seemed to like it in 2 of the other 3 movies and my investment in the characters became so low that I was starting to pick up where the animation loops were in the CGI crowd scenes because my mind had nothing else to do.

I don't hate it, just think it is a very very average movie I had no real interest in ever watching again."
"Jan 12, 2019",4,Gets better on subsequent viewings if taken as part of the whole series and if one either ignores a certain character or entertains a popular internet theory that has this character as the mastermind villain behind it all. Main problem with the movie was an attempt to create a character for comic relief would have been better served by placing a more serious character to occupy that place in the plot.
"Jan 11, 2019",3,"Jar Jar Binks is Basically Donkey from Shrek but less Annoying, also Boring Plot, Borin Visual Effects, and not so Good Scenes, No wonder it was Nominated for the Oscars."
"Jan 08, 2019",2.5,Not the worse in the franchise as that is the last jedi but it is boring along with some good action and at the time the best lightsaber duel until ep 3
"Jan 07, 2019",4,"To be honest people are being to harsh on this film . True it is a bit childish at places but it's a good movie at least in my opinion. It has a certain heart and wonderment to it that even though it takes a few missteps to put it nicely, it manages to be an interesting addition to the Star Wars franchise  . I would give this a 5 star if it wasn't for the obvious elephant in the room (jar jar of course) which stains the movie , but at least it doesn't stain the whole franchise like the sequel trilogy did ."
"Jan 07, 2019",3.5,"hate the kid Anakin and Jar jar, love the final jedi battle and it's soundtrack. In fact best soundtrack ever in my opinion."
"Jan 06, 2019",5,"This is truly my favorite movie of all time the lore and captivating characters of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Maul.and Padma and Anakin Skywalker this is a treasure for generations to come."
"Jan 05, 2019",5,Big Man says this is the best movie ever! 5/5
"Jan 05, 2019",5,"Even if this movie is considered bad and it had many flaws, it's still a gem compared to the Disney trash, namely TLJ. The lightsaber duels are amazingly choreographed and the movie respects the general in-universe lore (unlike the sequel trilogy) and does not feel like a blatant cashgrab. Also the meme factor and the fact that this movie has the cheesy feeling to it makes it worth a watch in my eyes. 

#boostThePrequelRatings"
"Jan 04, 2019",4,"Exciting beginning of the Star Wars Saga and the tale of Anakin Skywalker. The film itself is a reflection of Episode IV A New Hope, and uses it beautifully. Exciting and beautiful battles, thoughtfully crafted story, and an amazing cast.  A true joy to watch!"
"Jan 03, 2019",3,"An enjoyable flick, even with it's many flaws; Despite this it's better than the Sequel trilogy!"
"Dec 31, 2018",3,I donï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t think this movie is as bad as people make it out to be. I like  jar Jar Binks  I know I said it.I like Darth Maul and I just like this movie.
"Dec 31, 2018",1.5,Great actors and characters but awful movie
"Dec 29, 2018",3.5,"Weakest of prequel trilogy, enjoyable enough i suppose, needed more maul"
"Dec 28, 2018",3,"Bound to disappoint due to overwhelming and unachievable expectations, Phantom Menace lacks the charm and resemblance to the original trilogy, however it does offer great world-building, improved CGI and the best duel in the saga to date."
"Dec 27, 2018",2.5,"Oh boy. I’ll try and be fair. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are good additions as Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Darth Maul is an underrated badass. The score is of course phenomenal. And the lightsaber duel is one of the saga’s best. But then you have everything else. Jar Jar Binks was ridiculously annoying, little Anakin’s acting was more wooden than my chair, and some of the racial stereotypes on display are pretty offensive. Every actor gives the same wooden performance and the climax has four different things going on and I’m only really interested in one of them. This movie really let me down. "
"Dec 25, 2018",4.5,the movie is fun and entertaining and has things better than episode 7 and 8
"Dec 21, 2018",5,"Liam was amazing and Ewan is the perfect Obi-Wan! The problem lies with the awkward Padme and Anakin thing and the over, child-like humor from Jar Jar. Amazing stunts and a nice addition to the lore."
"Dec 19, 2018",2,"Darth Maul is why this gets 2 stars. Almost as bad as TLJ, but it actually has a lightsaber fight. "
"Dec 18, 2018",4.5,"ok, i know i said i love jar jar and all, and star wars 1-6 but before i wrote this review, i remembered i did have a couple of problems with this film, ok so i know the cgi technology want up to par like it was with attack of the clones and revenge of the sith, cause it was the early 90s but still in some shots like the battle between the droids and gungans it looks like some one copied a droid battleship and pasted it on  the battlefield it was just kindve distracting and jar jar was a bit more annoying in this film, other than that the film is great, like i said the prequels do not deserve the hate they were getting, im going to give this 4 and a half out of 5 stars"
"Dec 16, 2018",4,"Fantastic visuals for what is both the beginning and re-start of the Star Wars Skywalker saga. It's most difficult premise is accepting that the kind and talented little boy, Anakin, will one day grow up to be the evil Darth Vader. It's greatest flaw and its greatest boon is how difficult it is to unearth the subtlety from all the razzmatazz."
"Dec 12, 2018",5,This is probably the best Star Wars movie from the prequel trilogy. It has probably the best lightsaber duel in the entire franchise. Can't understand the low rating....
"Dec 11, 2018",1.5,Disappointing. (nothing more to say)
"Dec 10, 2018",4,"Although more family-friendly, cheesy, and in desperate need of lack of Jar Jar, TPM proves to be a beautiful, heartfelt tale to set off the story of Anakin Skywalker."
"Dec 09, 2018",2,some of the best music in the entire prequl trilogy and some great duels but...    JAR JAR
"Dec 06, 2018",3.5,"Lacks The Star Wars Action, But Good"
"Dec 02, 2018",3,"Better than you remember. The CGI effects have not aged as well as the practical effects in the original trilogy, but it does serve as a slow build to the series. Too much expectation was placed on it at the time to deliver the culmination of a billion fans dreams. In hindsight, it was a decent Sfi-fi flick and a low key start to the prequels."
"Dec 01, 2018",2,Nothing I can say about this hasn't been said already.
"Dec 01, 2018",2,"Your opinion on this film will depend on how you're approaching it. Die hard fans went in with unrealistic expectations, building a hype that no film could possibly meet. It's not a complete disaster, it does present us with terrific eye candy like the underwater city on Naboo, the pod race is one of the film's high points, and it's supplied with one of the greatest light saber duels in the entire saga. However, that does not make us overlook the cringe worthy dialogue and the two dimensional characters. Tear down the video game facade, and you're left with a rather shallow experience."
"Dec 01, 2018",2,Honestly was bad. Anakin and Jar Jar were the worst parts of this film. But Obi-Wan wasnt much better. And the rest of the characters none stood out as good or bad. Just Meh. Loved some of the alien designs.
"Nov 27, 2018",5,darth maul is the highlight of this film no doubt
"Nov 27, 2018",5,"A well crafted beginning of the evolution of Darth Vader. We meet Anakin Skywalker,a slave working at his master's parts establishment on the planet Tatooine. Jedi Master Jinn,Padawan Kenobi and Padme Amidala, Queen of Naboo we're forced to seek parts for their ship. Meanwhile, Darth Sidious ordered the Trade Federation to blockade Naboo in order to begin the destruction of the Jedi. Sidious has created an enormous army of droids led by the Sith apprentice, Count Dooku and General Grievious. However,the Siths's master plan is put on hold because of the emergence  and discovery of Anakin Skywalker. Skywalker is incredibly strong with the Force. He helps the Jedi and Queen obtain the ship's parts,is freed from slavery and reluctantly leaves his mother to leave with his new friends. Our heros return to Naboo which is under control of the Trade Federation and their battle droids. Jar Jar Binks arranges for a meeting of the Gungan leadership and Queen Amidala and the Jedi. The parties bury enmity and unite to attack the Droid army. As a fierce battle begins the Jedi, Amidala and Naboo warriors who evaded the invasion infiltrate the castle in which the Trade Federation leadership is located. The Jedi are separated from the freedom fighters when Darth Maul confronts them. The Gungan army isn't able to destroy the enormous Trade Federation shield and are being destroyed. Anakin with R2D2 accidentally start up a Naboo fighter and rocket to space joining the small squad of fighters attempting to destroying the Trade Federation ship that controls the entire droid army. Maul kills Master Jinn but is destroyed in turn by Kenobi. Anakin with the Force guiding him destroys the Trade Federation ship shutting down the entire droid army. A celebration begins as the Jedi Council and newly elected Chancellor Palpatine arrive on Naboo. Obi-Wan is elevated as Jedi and assigned to train Anakin. The Jedi discover the dead Sith but worry about the second Sith alive and the rise of the Dark Side. 
     Darth Sidious AKA Senator/Chancellor Palpatine used his Confederate army to get elected Supreme Chancellor. He also knew events would reveal the ""Chosen One."" The Sith also had a clone army being  prepared to destroy the Jedi. However, Palpatine's goal was to have Vallorum replaced by himself . He would build up both the Droid Confederate Army and the Republic Clone Army. Amazing plan to destroy the Jedi,have Darth Vader at his side,and declare himself Emperor. 
     George Lucas brilliantly tells a tale of Palpatine's machinations as well as the emergence of the child who will become Darth Vader."
"Nov 26, 2018",5,I am a big Star Wars fan and the phantom menace is top 10 favorite movie of all time
"Nov 25, 2018",2,"""The Phantom Menace"" isn't nearly as bad as obsessive fans claim, however, that doesn't mean it comes without it's flaws, some of which that are so large and noticeable, it's understandable why die hard fans were so furious when it was finally shown to the world. It has it's strong moments, the underwater city, the pod race, and one of the best lightsaber duels in the whole saga. But it's impossible to ignore the sloppy direction, dialogue that makes you cringe, and the two dimensional characters."
"Nov 23, 2018",2.5,"Jarjar is so annoying, the dialogue is so cheesy and kiddish, and it is so boring. Nobody wants to see animal as a child. And Darth maul is so weak and disappointing. Even seeing obi wan is disappointing because he is just an ordinary padawan."
"Nov 21, 2018",3,"The only truly bad film of this trilogy in my opinion is attack of the clones.
Phantom Menace benefitted from solid performances by Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson. Natalie portman is good as Padme and even the kid who played Anakin was charming. It doesnt rank with the originals but its a modestly entertaining and well executed sci-fi film. Ignore jar jar binks, wait for the pod racing sequence."
"Nov 21, 2018",3,The lightsaber fight at the end makes the child actor worth it.
"Nov 19, 2018",2,"It's a good structured film with a great villain that is underused. But the pod race, the gungans, the senator negotiations and weird humot kills this movie. Also the characters are not that well portrayed, specially Anakin."
"Nov 17, 2018",2.5,Star  Wars: The Phantom Menace includes a mix of exciting fight scenes with Darth Maul mixed with annoying characters and a not particularly interesting story line.
"Nov 17, 2018",5,"Its better than the next two. qui-gon is a character that makes you care, even though the rest of the movie is full of ham. But its made for kids IMO, so its still a favorite"
"Nov 15, 2018",1.5,Random sh*t that happens in space: A star wars movie
"Nov 14, 2018",3,"Lacks much of the comedy and light action that made the originals instant classics. Though, on it's own, without colossal expectations it is not nearly THAT bad."
"Nov 13, 2018",2,"Cosa posso dire su questo film che nessuno abbia già detto? Beh, forse che, pur essendo orribile, non è secondo me il peggiore  in assoluto della saga di Star Wars: quel primato spetta al seguito, episodi II. Tuttavia, La Minaccia Fantasma ha tutto quello che serve per risultare uno dei film più odiati della storia del cinema. la storia è incomprensibile ed eccessivamente complicata, i personaggi sono poco interessanti o semplicemente stupidi (il famigerato Jar Jar Binks in primis) e gli effetti speciali sono troppo presenti e con troppa CGI, con il risultato che Yoda, realizzato invece con il vecchio pupazzo, sembra non entrarci niente con l'ambiente circostante. Tutto riguardo questo film non funziona, con poche eccezioni: la scena del triello finale, impreziosito dalla straordinaria musica di John Williams, e la recitazione di Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson e Natalie Portman, le cui performance risultano però rovinate dalla caratterizzazione dei loro personaggi, pressoché inesistenti. Il piccolo Anakin è interpretato da Jake Lloyd, che, sebbene non raggiunga i livelli di inespressività del suo successore Hayden Christensen, non può fare molto per salvare un personaggio fin troppo puerile e ammiccante al pubblico più giovane. In poche parole, se questo film è così odiato e così ricordato come una delle più grandi delusioni della storia del cinema, un motivo c'è... anzi, parecchi motivi. Fatevi un favore e state alla larga dalla trilogia prequel, a meno che non siate dei fan superaccaniti della saga."
"Nov 11, 2018",3,"The Phantom Menace is slow and unnecessary, but not as bad as many make it out to be. The Duel of the Fates and the music that goes with it is worth it for me, and the movie offers some explanations for the rest of the movies. However, this movie was definitely a disappointment after the original trilogy."
"Nov 11, 2018",5,"Best movie in the history of movies, maybe ever."
"Nov 10, 2018",5,I still like this one
"Nov 05, 2018",4.5,Best light saber duel in the series loved it
"Nov 05, 2018",1,I can't stand 10 minutes watching ythis.
"Oct 30, 2018",2,Is better than the last Jedi but barely.  If not for lightsaber fight at end would be worse than last Jedi.  Jar jar less annoying than rose  Darth maul rules
"Oct 28, 2018",4,Very underrated. Excellent battle scenes with a great villain
"Oct 25, 2018",5,At least the memes are there. And there are really cool characters like Darth Maul and Qui-Gon. Who doesn't want to see a young Obi-Wan too! I liked the universe better during that time. A better atmosphere and interesting story plots. Heaven forbid they try to have an original story or plot in Star Wars. I like the emphasis on galactic politics and peace. Not just the only 1-2 people who have a light saber. 
"Oct 25, 2018",5,Very underrated Lucas did a good job on this movie
"Oct 22, 2018",2.5,"Jake Lloyd is bad and Jar Jar is annoying, but its not as bad as people make it out to be."
"Oct 21, 2018",2.5,Weakest of the prequel trilogy. Only saved by acting of Liam Neeson and Ewan Macgregor. Lightsaber battle at the end was awesome. The killing of Maul was not.
"Oct 15, 2018",4,"Not bad not great, darth maul saved the film for me."
"Oct 14, 2018",4,"A great film, just not the masterpiece black and white good guys vs bad guys adventure fans where expecting after the long wait between episodes 6 and 1. There are some glaring problems with the film but I find the positives outweigh the negatives in this one."
"Oct 13, 2018",4,"Just stop!!! This movie is not bad. Yes Jar Jar Binks was annoying, but if it weren't for him, the queen would have been screwed!!!"
"Oct 10, 2018",5,A great film if your really into the EU(Expanded Universe)  content as I am.
"Oct 10, 2018",3,"Far from the best film in the series, Phantom Menace would be much better without Gungans or senate hearings. Still , I loved Qui-gon jinn and Darth Maul and Ewan Mcgregor does a stand up job as Obi Wan Kenobi. The duel of fates at the end is one of the best sword fights in cinema and because of that I love this film despite it's many, MANY flaws."
"Oct 08, 2018",3.5,"The movie has a lot of flaws. But it introduces an interesting new Star Wars world, with new types of ships and new lightsabers. And the soundtrack is great. You can criticise it, but you can't deny the greatness of ""Duel of the Fates""."
"Oct 08, 2018",3.5,"It's a Star Wars movie, so I do have some good things to say about it. Darth Maul is an awesome villain, with one of the best lightsabers in the the galaxy. The podracer scene is fun and exciting, too. But There were also a lot of bad things in Episode I as well. Jar Jar Binks is probably the most annoying character in all of Star Wars, and a lot of the story line is cheesy and unrealistic (even for a Star Wars movie)."
"Oct 06, 2018",2,"This is still a bad movie. Episode I is the second worst live-action Star Wars film right behind Episode II. It is so boring. Nothing in The Phantom Menace makes any sense, it's like the script was written by an eight-year-old. The story makes no sense. The movie doesn't really even have a plot. A trade federation organization is for some reason really stupid and evil because they get duped by and trust some holographic message of an evil old guy wearing a black robe who looks like Satan. The separatist leaders' space station is shaped like a half-eaten doughnut. Then there is a really annoying, unfunny, stupid, idiotic, racially offensive slapstick cartoonish character named Jar Jar Binks who is an outcast of his race known as Gungans. His own people hate him because he is a big clumsy oaf who accidentally destroyed some valuable ship or something. The two main Jedi in this movie are Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The other characters are Padme Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, Mace Windu, Senator Palpatine, Queen Amidala's decoy, Boss Nass, and Darth Maul. The CGI is horrible. The pacing is horrible. The dialogue is terrible. The acting is horrible and emotionless. Even Liam Neeson was wooden as a plank in this movie. A lot of people say Jake Lloyd's acting was the worst in this movie, but it was actually Keira Knightley's acting that was the worst. She spoke every single line with literally zero emotion and had no facial expression throughput the entire film. She was like an android. The characters are cardboard cut-outs including Obi-Wan. None of them have any personality and they're all stoic. We don't get to meet Anakin until like 40 minutes into the film. The pod-racing scene was cool at first, but gets boring after awhile and wastes a lot of time and pacing in the film. Why did Anakin build C3PO? What was the point of him building him? Why did Anakin have to be a nine-year-old kid in this movie? Couldn't he have started out as a fifteen or sixteen-year-old teenager instead? We don't get to meet Yoda until like an hour and half in the film. Why were Midichlorians the reason the Force gets used? In the original trilogy, it was explained that the Force was the binding energy that surrounds the galaxy. In this movie, it's stated that the Force is energy coming from microorganisms inside cells of living beings that tell them the ways of the Force and when to use it. Such a huge continuity error. Darth Maul is a Sith who barely talks in this movie. He only has like 3 or 4 lines in this movie. He was a wasted villain. The only good scenes in this movie are the pod race and the final lightsaber battle with Darth Maul which was actually cool.

Rating: 4.5/10"
"Oct 04, 2018",3.5,"What the film lacks in good dialogue it is the first step into the larger universe of Star Wars and its complexity. Overall a good film, it is not the original trilogy but it is a good film."
"Oct 04, 2018",4,The weakest of the prequels
"Oct 02, 2018",2.5,"This film really dragged. The podrace was too long and the film tries to explain too many things. Points off for Jar-Jar. If you want to see how this could have been a better movie, watch ""The Phantom Edit"""
"Oct 01, 2018",4.5,"This movie was way ahead of its time. If we reexamine this film, we will all realize what a precious gem it is. Sure, there are flaws, but they are overwhelmingly outweighed by the dramatic masterpiece that kicks off the prequel trilogy."
"Sep 30, 2018",3,"Although not the best movie ever, it has some awesome fight scenes, and epic music. It was good returning to the star wars universe again. And it certainly is better than the cinematic failure, The Last Jedi..."
"Sep 29, 2018",4,"Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a good prequel to the Skywalker Saga but lacks the action that Star Wars movies should have. Two Jedi Knights escape a hostile blockade to find allies and come across a young boy who may bring balance to the Force, but the long dormant Sith resurface to claim their old glory.

It has great visual effects and this prequel really shows how they met Anakin Skywalker. This film is the Star Wars film that people were really waiting for so that's why it got over a billion at the box office. My favourite scene is when Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi fight Darth Maul because that scene has the most action. My only problem with this movie is that it doesn't have enough Star Wars action, compared to the other films. The film is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy.  I would recommend this film to Star Wars fan who have not yet seen the prequels.

Grade B+"
"Sep 28, 2018",0.5,"This was painful.

I remember watching this film when it was released. I was eleven years old, and I loved it.

Watching it now, at 30, I could barely finish it. I understand, now, that children were the intended target audience.

Jar Jar Binks is possibly the singular worst thing to ever happen to the Star Wars films. Annoying and unnecessary does not even begin to describe the character.

The script is abysmal, and subsequently there is not a single noteworthy performance in the whole of film. Liam Neeson and Ian McDiarmid give passable attempts, but nothing ever rises above mediocre.

The CGI may have been good for the time, but it has not aged well. The practical effects of the original trilogy surpass the eyesore that is The Phantom Menace by an easy mile.

The plot is simple and mundane and boring and does not warrant the excessive run time. The Trade Federation is angry about some taxes, so they invade Naboo. That's it. That's literally the entire plot of The Phantom Menace.

The characters are one dimensional and uninteresting. There's literally no character development or background given for anyone. Who is Darth Maul? Where did he come from? Who is Qui-Gon Jinn? Who is Queen Amidala? Why should the viewer care about any of them?

What a nightmare."
"Sep 26, 2018",4,"At first I hated this movie like everyone else. I thought Jar Jar and Anakin were annoying. But when you watch it with the fact that Jar Jar is a Sith controlling everything in mind, this movie is sick."
"Sep 24, 2018",3.5,Worth seeing just for the pod race and darth maul
"Sep 24, 2018",2,Annoying characters take magic and fun out of Star Wars.
"Sep 23, 2018",1.5,"A movie that is actually worse than you remember it, like a lot worse. The CGI looks bad and is over used, most of the movie is boring, the acting is uninspiring (especially the kids), the writing is way worse than I remember it and there are many of the alien-characters that leave you speechless in their awfulness. I could stack up more minor problems and things I just don't like but I would instead like to talk about the most off-putting thing:

Jar Jar Binks is just as awful as people on the internet says he is. He might be worse in my opinion. He is supposed to be a comic-relief but he is never funny, not once. He ruined every singel scene he was in and is so unbelievable that the whole movie loses its credibility. Like why is he a part of the crew? He shows them the way to the stupid underwater king (who is also very dumb) and that should be the end of him, but it isn't! Why? Why would they keep the complete idiot and useless dude around? Why is promoted all the time? Why does he talk the way he does, it is not funny just stupid? Its like the Avengers would just pick up a random non-powered hobo who is mildly retarded and just say: ""Hey man do you wanna be a part of this super important mission to save the universe?"" He also looks very ugly. 

No matter what anyone says, the new ones ARE better than this. Not sorry."
"Sep 22, 2018",2,"The only reason to see this movie, is for Liam Neeson, and of course Ewan McGregor who is just fabulous as Obi-Wan."
"Sep 20, 2018",4,"Jar Jar Binks, why?? So pleased he was given a lesser role in the subsequent movies."
"Sep 20, 2018",4,I fucking loved it more than the last Jedi
"Sep 17, 2018",3,I was so excited to finally get the prequel and this movie was a let down. It's still watchable and the movies progress better. Jar Jar really ruins it and Anakin is really annoying here.
"Sep 17, 2018",2.5,The first of the Star Wars prequel trilogy kicks off with poor pacing and a boring plot.
"Sep 12, 2018",2,"The chronological first of the episodic Star Wars films, and the first Star Wars film in quite some time, TPM had a lot riding on it. The trailer looked fantastic, we had a new lightsaber design, and the world was excited. And then...it came out. Flat performances, a bumbling slapstick character, complicated and nonsensical plot, and trying to accomplish too much leave this movie feeling both half baked and burned at the same time. By Lucas's own admission, he went too far in some places. Tonally it's a bit all over the shop, as we go from celebration to the death of a hero, to another odd moment with jar jar, to a funeral and then again to a celebration. All in all, it's not the worst film I've ever seen but it is FAR from the best."
"Sep 10, 2018",0.5,The Phantom Menace shows that George Lucas has a great imagination and that he can churn out some great scenes here and there - such as the famous Darth Maul fight - but it unfortunately also shows that the overall quality of the film can't live up the idea on paper.
"Sep 08, 2018",1.5,"Atrocious. Of the three worst Star Wars films, I rank this as the worst, followed closely by Clones and then Last Jedi. Fans waited for years to see a whiny 9 year old Jake Lloyd. He makes Threepio but somehow forgets decades later. Midicholorians ruin the mysticism of the Force. The droids are boring villains. Someone had to play Jar Jar Binks, who until Last Jedi was unquestionably worst Star Wars character (Rose and Holdo are the nee challengers).. "
"Sep 05, 2018",4,"IT's very good. not great. It's not great because Darth Maul was underused. It also started with taxation and trade issues, which seemed to contrast the space fantasy adventure that is Star Wars. But still a very enjoyable film I have watched many times."
"Aug 31, 2018",3.5,"While its not the best, The Phantom Menace is still an enjoyable Star Wars feature."
"Aug 31, 2018",3,"Not as bad as they say, I enjoyed myself. Still not very good, though."
"Aug 29, 2018",2,"Quite bad, but the new ones are even worse."
"Aug 29, 2018",5,Jar jar binks and darth maul what more do you want
"Aug 28, 2018",5,It enriches the SW universe. It must be seen as a part of a modern greek tragedy. Georges creativity is incredible.
"Aug 27, 2018",1,The only remotely good thing is the pod race. And even that's shit.
"Aug 20, 2018",3,Borring and some characters were oful 
"Aug 20, 2018",0.5,THIS IS A GARBAGE MOVE WITH NO REDEEMING QUALITIES!
"Aug 15, 2018",2,Has its moments but overall really bad. 
"Aug 12, 2018",2,"This movie has far too many politics and bad acting, but sort of makes up for it with scenes like the Pod Race and the Darth Maul fight."
"Aug 11, 2018",3.5,"I enjoyed it, but not as good as the O.T."
"Aug 06, 2018",4.5,"The most imaginative of all the series, keying up the masterpiece story arc. As usual, hollywood is the party that can't make heads or tails of the script, applying it's ever present handicapp."
"Aug 03, 2018",4.5,Love the pod racing and lightsaber duel. I enjoy this one.
"Aug 03, 2018",4,I enjoy this movie. Don't get all the hate
"Aug 02, 2018",5,"Cool visual effects, even better fight scenes.  Pod racing was fun to watch as the movie explained Skywalker's origins"
"Aug 01, 2018",2.5,"Unfortunately, George Lucas has lost the cinematic prowess he was once famous for, replacing extraordinary practical effects and cinematography for wooden dialogue and aging cgi"
"Aug 01, 2018",4,Very Underrated film. I personally enjoy it very much.
"Aug 01, 2018",4,I really enjoy this movie.
"Jul 31, 2018",4,A masterpiece of a film.
"Jul 30, 2018",1,"Pros: score, Darth Maul, some performances
Cons: effects, Jar Jar Binks, most performances"
"Jul 29, 2018",4.5,"I liked this film, saw it in the cinema. Don't know what people problem is."
"Jul 29, 2018",3.5,"This movie has great moments like the light saber battle but there is a lot of bad problems like Anakin, rubbish script, not a good story and too much Jar Jar Binks."
"Jul 25, 2018",2.5,"Star Wars fans often give The Phantom Menace more hate than it deserves. Before everyone gets out their pitchforks, I don't think it is a good film. I merely consider it not to be the worst Star Wars film - that dubious honor goes to Attack of the Clones. While The Phantom Menace is not a good film, with boring or annoying heroes and non-threatening or underdeveloped villains, it is saved from complete awfulness by an exciting final battle and an excellent score.

The main issue I have with The Phantom Menace is that the main characters are at all least one of the following: badly written, badly acted, or underutilized. Jar Jar is a general irritant, a poorly executed comic relief character who is often used by fans of the series as a symbol of their dislike of the prequels. Natalie Portman gives a mediocre performance as Padme and her character has some cringe-worthy dialogue, especially when talking to Anakin. As for Anakin, Jake Lloyd gives a poor performance (which doesn't make the vitriol the poor kid received any more acceptable - he's a child actor being directed by George Lucas, after all) and is written as a sort of child genius who is special in every possible way (the chosen one, Force sensitive, an expert at building droids and podracers, an ace pilot, etc.), reminiscent of a younger version of the much-despised Wesley Crusher over on Star Trek. As for Qui Gon and Obi Wan, they are much more tolerable, but the film does little of interest with either character over the course of the movie.

The portrayal of the antagonists is also the source of some of the issues with this film. At the beginning of A New Hope, the film shows stormtroopers clearing the Tantive IV of rebel soldiers while sustaining minimal casualties. This builds them up as menacing adversaries, something that is frequently forgotten given their later portrayals. The battle droids, on the other hand, spend their first few scenes being effortlessly reduced to piles of spare parts by the Jedi. The Neimoidians are equally nonthreatening, with a portrayal as greedy, incompetent cowards. This creates an issue for the entire trilogy and most of the spin offs set during this period, as it makes the main villains hard to take seriously. While Darth Maul is more menacing and has an awesome character design, he never receives any backstory or motivation - much like the criticism fans had about Snoke in The Last Jedi, except Maul is built up to a greater degree.

While The Phantom Menace is possibly one of the most despised film of its decade, the film has some positive aspects which prevent it from being entirely terrible. The score is one of John Williams' finest works, with ""Duel of the Fates"" being a particular standout. A lot of work also obviously went into designing the sets, starships, and planets, although the extensive use of CGI leads to the world looking less real than that depicted in the Original Trilogy. However, neither of these is the reason why I'm more forgiving of this film than Attack of the Clones. One scene elevates The Phantom Menace slightly - the climactic battle between the two Jedi and Darth Maul, set to the aforementioned ""Duel of the Fates"". This fight is one of the best lightsaber duels of the franchise and more exciting than anything else the next film in the franchise would offer.

Despite the flashy effects and an enjoyable lightsaber duel, there is no way I can recommend Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Most of the film is either boring or cringey. It is possible for a film with a mediocre plot and characters to stand out solely based of its action scenes and visuals. A New Hope, while blessed with interesting characters and worldbuilding, was successful in large part due to its innovative visuals. An even better example is Avatar, which broke box office records because of its visuals, not its insipid plot or forgettable characters. The major difference is that these films had numerous scenes throughout the movie showcasing their strengths. The Phantom Menace spends too much of its runtime on pointless or boring scenes which provide little in the way of entertainment."
"Jul 25, 2018",3.5,"This would be one of the strongest entries into the Star Wars saga if not for the fact of it coming off the original trilogy (and the notoriously bad Jar Jar Binks.)
-7/10"
"Jul 24, 2018",5,"I love how people say they hate it but have absolutely no logical reasons why. ""Cringey."" Really? Where? At what point? You just sound like some ass-hurt people who simply aren't fans of the sci-fi genre. A genuine dislike comes from critiquing the film's score, script. At what time exactly is dialogue awful? This shit's a grade A movie, gtfo here with your shitty comments. The film is beautifully made, has great visuals and effects, musical score is iconic, some scenes are considered classics such as the final fight against Darth Maul. Please, if you're going to write some shitty comment back it up with some facts instead of your shitty emotional complaints."
"Jul 23, 2018",4,Really fun movie with some interesting and cool characters and fun action.
"Jul 21, 2018",3.5,Adds a lot to the franchise overall.
"Jul 21, 2018",4,I grew up with this film and enjoy it very much.
"Jul 20, 2018",4,Worthy Star wars entry. I don't understand all the hate.
"Jul 20, 2018",4,"Very UNDERRATED! Gets to much hate for stupid reasons. Good visuals, some cool new characters, and entertaining action."
"Jul 20, 2018",2.5,Midichlorians - Simple. ohhh...
"Jul 20, 2018",5,"While it has some bad elements it's very enjoyable, it introduces new great characters and it has great actors like Ewan Mcgregor, Natalie Portman and Ian McDiarmid"
"Jul 20, 2018",3,"Jar Jar may suck, but the cool fighting scenes make up for it."
"Jul 16, 2018",3,I saw the original movies a long time ago. I recently watched Star Wars again..I am just now getting to these. I just say I don’t hate them. I don’t know why people hate these movies so much..
"Jul 15, 2018",5,At last we will reveal ourselves. At last we will have revenge. 
"Jul 12, 2018",0.5,"When I watch a movie, I hate when someone's disturbing me. When I saw this, I gladly paused the movie and gave our dogs a bath. Of course, I had to continue watching ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace."" It was..... sleepy. Man, with tons of dialogue you'd think that a writer on the level of George Lucas could at least make an interesting line. But, sadly, he did not. This movie (not the actors) deserved the hate it got."
"Jul 09, 2018",4,Very nice comenack by Lucas. Some flaws but still decent. The Darth Maul fighting scenes are worth the movie.
"Jul 08, 2018",4,"After the terrible episodes 7 and 8, we can now see what happens when people who don't have the same talent and creativity of the person who created it. The Prequels feature new worlds, new aliens, and new space ships. The Sequels don't have any of that."
"Jul 08, 2018",4,I really enjoy this film. Jar Jar can be a little over the top but he doesn’t ruin the movie for me. The visuals still hold today for this film and I really enjoy Ewan Mcgregar and Liam Neeson as Obi-Wan and Gui-Gon. It also has the best lightsaber duel in the entire saga in my opinion.
"Jul 08, 2018",4,A fun movie overall. Great action and some good new characters.
"Jul 08, 2018",3.5,"Well......the Star Wars prequels have been criticized much. Most of the critics were negative, and I partly agree with them. I have never seen this movie in theaters, because I wasn't born yet and when I started to watch Star Wars, TPM was my first ever Star Wars movie. Back then, I had no phone or internet and I didn't notice the hate, that was going on. But I can say, I really enjoyed it. Just later, people told me this movie was bad. So I rewatched it and I noticed a lot of things I didn't notice, when I was younger. So, my opinion is, you can absoluteky enjoy this movie if you don't look for bad things. But if you DO look for the mistakes, yousa gonna finda lotta them."
"Jul 08, 2018",4,Overall I enjoy this film. Jar Jar can be a little over the top but he doesn't ruin the movie. best lightsaber duel in the sage and some amazing action. Ewan Mcregar and Liam Neeson have great performances. Overall the positives outweigh the negatives.
"Jul 05, 2018",2.5,"The first film in a trilogy of prequels exploring the origins of the original trilogy's main villain and father of its main character, Anakin Skywalker came to the world 16 years after Return of the Jedi. While in that period of time, George Lucas, the creator of this franchise, was trying to get the best out of visual effects, it's safe to say he wasn't training in order to improve on his storytelling or filmmaking skills; ""The Phantom Menace"" is shockingly inferior to the original Star Wars trilogy films. When the planet Naboo is blockaded by the Trade Federation, the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi are asked to negotiate with the Federation Viceroy. They are not aware though that the Sith Lord Darth Sidious has planned a trap for them. One thing leads to another and the two Jedi soon find themselves in a mission to rescue Padmé Amidala, Queen of Naboo and coming across the young Anakin Skywalker, which has advanced Force skills, believing he is ""the chosen one"".  Despite the interesting plotting, the execution is very problematic. The tone is extremely inconsistent, the character of Jar Jar Binks is straight up annoying and cringe worthy, most of the dialogue is overly clichéd and unnatural, there are several pacing issues and while the visuals are top notch, there is way too much of them. Shutout to the actors - most of them - for managing to rise above the mediocrity of the script. The film also delivers on the action and without doubt with its powerfully composed score, once again by the mastermind John Williams. All in all, a very polarizing experience."
"Jul 04, 2018",5,It's a really good movie not listen to anyone who says it isn't. The only bad part in the movie is the jar jar Binks parts. Liam makes a wonderful Jedi.
"Jul 04, 2018",3,Better than some believe and I like it even more since the Disney junk came out
"Jul 01, 2018",5,"Much better than soylo. With a little ironing out, This movie could have been even greater. 
Dont pay for anything soylo a soy wars story."
"Jun 30, 2018",5,2nd best Star Wars film.
"Jun 28, 2018",3,"Boring movie, exept for every qui-gon quote."
"Jun 26, 2018",4,I thought it was pretty good
"Jun 26, 2018",3,"Not a bad story, but lots of lost potential.  More focus on the jedi and Maul and less on galactic politics would've made it shine.  One of the best scores of the franchise with an amazing lightsaber duel can't keep this one from being mostly boring world building.  The pod race is fun as is the last battle.  The robotic dialogue and mostly bland characters are the prequels bane."
"Jun 26, 2018",2.5,"Um... ok, I really liked how the prequel’s are but you can do better"
"Jun 26, 2018",4,"Lots of Fun, great Star wars film, acting a bit flakey"

"Jun 22, 2018",5,Very good movie highly recommended
"Jun 21, 2018",4.5,Master piece movie. Phantom menace is amazing masterpiece and a good franchise don't listen to the haters they killed Star Wars
"Jun 21, 2018",5,Most amazing movie and best of the franchise. This movie is masterpiece and it made Star Wars to love this fans those toxic fans should have regret of what they did to the Franchise
"Jun 21, 2018",4,"Never understood why there was so much hate for this movie as i find it to be pretty good all around. aside from too much jar jar at times, it's a very enjoyable watch."
"Jun 19, 2018",1,Ummm... yeah. Not as bad as most preach it is but not exactly the highlight of the Star Wars Franchise or any of the actors in it.
"Jun 19, 2018",3.5,"The best of this movie is the best of the entire prequels.  Qui-Gon Jinn, and Obi-Wan Kenobi versus Darth Maul is easily the best fight ever in a SW movie.  Their story arc more than makes up for the dreadful Jar Jar scenes and syrupy sweet young Anakin Skywalker.  Also, Naboo is the most wonderful location Lucas ever created, making TPM the most beautiful of all the SW movies. Naboo is the only place in the SW universe I'd want to live.  TPM has a bit too much of the goofy humor and the pod race goes on a bit too long.  Just stick around till the end.  You won't be disappointed!"
"Jun 18, 2018",2,"All unmet 1999 fanboy expectations aside, I can now watch The Phantom Menace with different eyes now that I know where Luas and the broader Star Wars Universe was going. I can appreciate the whole midichlorians, Chosen One, etc components that in 1999, pissed me off. However, the first 20 minutes of Episode I are still the worst 20 minutes of the 6 film stretch. Getting past them is hard, but once I do, I'm sucked in and, despite the subpar acting and even less impressive dialogue, I'm too in love with the whole Star Wars thing that I'm immediately in line for this 3D version. Seeing Episode I, not filmed in 3D, rotoscoped to appear 3D is absolutely elementary. We are talking ILM, here. And even they couldn't get it right. Unless you want to experience Episode I in the theater again, don't waste your money on the 3D."
"Jun 18, 2018",3,"I loved this film when I was a kid... now that I grew up I can understand why viewers had some issues with the film . while it's not what we all expected, I have to say it's still an AVERAGE film due to the epic music score and battles here and there."
"Jun 17, 2018",4,After the new movies prequels are now great movies
"Jun 16, 2018",4,Not gonna lie i really like this movie saw it 3 times in theatres probably 30 times at home
"Jun 16, 2018",2,"Somewhere, in the editing room, I'm sure there's a good movie here."
"Jun 15, 2018",3,"so much potential but fell short.  the best part of the movie is the battle of darth maul.  the worst part, oh look by some fluke accident anakin's fighter ship flies into on of the space stations that happens to be the one that controls all the droids and other space attack stations and then destroys it from the inside out."
"Jun 14, 2018",3,Eh. Drawn out but pretty decent.
"Jun 13, 2018",3,"I actually like this movie a lot more than most it seems. The sheer awfulness of young Anakin and Jar Jar is offset by the sheer brilliance of the score and the final lightsaber duel, which is by far the best in the whole Saga."
"Jun 12, 2018",5,"Good effects for the time, amazing soundtrack, cool design over all and a nice reboot to the series. 
Episode 8 pales in comparison."
"Jun 11, 2018",1,It only gets a star for Liam Neeson and nothing else writing was awful
"Jun 07, 2018",0.5,"you don't even need to watch the movie to know the plot is going to suck.""Taxation of trade routes"",""The greedy trade federation""(wow looks like George lucas was directing this movie towards kids (I.E pod racing)).Jar Jar is the dumbest character in all of star wars,Anakin is annoying,and could they just remove the midiclorian scene. overall its all trash(besides duel of the fates (half a star for that))"
"Jun 06, 2018",1,"It has some good moments (like the action scenes, the pod-race scene, John Williams's score, Ewan's Obi-Wan, Liam's Qui-Gon and Lightsaber duel with Darth Maul) but the rest is terrible... no wait I'll take it back... IT""S HORRIBLE and it scared my childhood for life."
"Jun 05, 2018",3.5,"Star Wars : Episode I-The Phantom Menace is a very good film,but it uses a lot of CGI"
"Jun 03, 2018",3.5,"Way too political. Has a few interesting moments, especially at the end, but just isn't what we wanted from a Star Wars movie."
"Jun 03, 2018",3,This movie was simply meh
"Jun 02, 2018",2.5,Jar Jar was a mistake. ‘Nuff said.
"May 31, 2018",5,this film has a better plot than the last jedi.
"May 31, 2018",4,"Review for all prequels. I know the prequels get a lot of shade from people and I understand why, CGI isn't the best, acting is kind of bad at parts and the pacing is weird too, but the prequels have given us some really amazing things as well like, the back story of darth vader, a look at the clone wars, darth maul and duel of the fates, and young obi wan. If George Lucas didn't push for the CGI work in the prequels, ILM wouldn't be where they are now. Both the the Originals and Prequels pushed the boundaries of CGI. Lastly the story is there, its just not executed properly, but a remake is out of the question."
"May 31, 2018",5,darth maul survived i watched solo this film biggest downfall for me was his death but now he survived my experience watching this film will be better knowing he survived somehow
"May 31, 2018",3.5,"In retrospect, there is a fair amount to appreciate for Star Wars fans. The world building is good and I don't mind some exposition. I do wish the battle droids were a bit more menacing and that Anakin started off as a young adult instead."
"May 30, 2018",1,"The writing is uninteresting, the acting is wooden the effects doesn't look promising, the comedy is childish. "
"May 30, 2018",3,"The prequels are highly underrated. The main issues: 
the pacing, some of the dialogue/writing and of course 
jar jar. But the action is great, it has a great soundtrack/score, the political intrigue fascinated me and 
Makes the world seem believable and immersive. That's just my opinion I love the prequels as much as the originals and wish they get more love than they do."
"May 29, 2018",3,the fight at the end if one of the best ever.
"May 29, 2018",5,I guess it took a lot of actually bad movies to make me realize this actually wasn't that bad. Aside from the jar jar fart scene on tatooine and ani's acting (which is understandable considering his age and that it follows well with how George directed hayden in the following films) this movie is actually fun. The podracing scene is visually beautiful and exciting.
"May 29, 2018",2,Jar Jar haunts my dreams.
"May 28, 2018",3.5,Saved in the last 20 minutes
"May 28, 2018",3,"Loopings at the new Star Wars movies, I have to give this one a better rating."
"May 27, 2018",5,better than SJW wars
"May 27, 2018",0.5,Worst movie of all time.
"May 27, 2018",1.5,"not that great of a movie, still okay but certainly not great. Darth Maul is a great character, Qui-Gon Jin is also pretty cool in this movie, but it was just kind of boring. Still better than Episode 2 though."
"May 27, 2018",5,Great soundtrack. Great costumes. Great lightsaber duel. Great vilain and great Qui-Gon Jin. Better than the new ones.
"May 27, 2018",3,Still better than the new ones
"May 27, 2018",0.5,Lightsaber fight scene at the end is the only thing good about this trash of a movie.
"May 26, 2018",3.5,"The worst possible introduction of the greatest villian of all time. The Podracing scene still is one of the best scenes in history when it comes to soundmixing and editing. Neeson is okay, Jar Jar's George biggest failure and mistake. McGregor and Maul are outstanding. 3 1/2*"
"May 26, 2018",3,"When compared to the Last Jedi or Force awakens, this movie is a epic worthy of every major film award."
"May 26, 2018",3,"Star Wars the Phantom Menace was ok, there are Jedi and they are the good guys and the Sith are bad guys, they want to take control of the galaxy. As for Jedi they are providing peas to the galaxy for every one. Now who will win! There is a boy Anakin Skywalker keep in mind will he be a Jedi soon "
"May 25, 2018",5,I so need a Nubian ship!
"May 25, 2018",0.5,Worst star wars movie ever made
"May 25, 2018",0.5,darth maul and quigon jin are the only good characters in the beginning of anakin skywalker's story. but they both die.  and midichlorians are the source of the force? what happened to life being the source? crap
"May 25, 2018",5,Great movie compared to the new ones
"May 25, 2018",5,Holds up a lot more after dealing with Disney Star Wars
"May 23, 2018",2,"2/5.  The podrace and the final duel are both awesome, Darth Maul is an awesome looking villain, and Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are fine, but The Phantom Menage has a dull story that doesn't make much sense, along with characters that are ether boring or cringeworthy."
"May 23, 2018",5,"To start Star Wars episode 1 does not seem like a bad movie to me, whatever the fans of the original trilogy say, if it is true that episode 2 is somewhat weaker.  She's always been underrated for Jar Jar Binks.  The script is not bad, the visual effects are incredible, the best soundtrack of the entire saga without a doubt, perfect performances, I highlight those of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, the performance of Jake Lloyd sometimes too over-acted, but well, it is  a 9-year-old boy cannot be asked for much either, characters with a lot of charisma.  I put a 10 because I think it is a great science fiction movie and because this movie has accompanied me from 4 years old to 23 years old today"
"May 23, 2018",4,"I enjoyed the movie, Special Effects have come a long way since the original trilogy. Jar Jar is very annoying, Minor spoiler, After Qui-gon and Obi-wan get through the planet core, they should have force choked Jar Jar."
"May 22, 2018",3,Three stars for Darth Maul alone!
"May 21, 2018",5,just needed more Maul
"May 21, 2018",1,Nothing more to say.  Awful.
"May 21, 2018",4,In retrospect... not as bad as we thought Star Wars could be...
"May 21, 2018",5,Mee teesa rodda co pana pee choppa chawa!
"May 21, 2018",5,Loved it I could watch it for 24 hours straight.
"May 21, 2018",3.5,"The Phantom Menace crafts an interesting and well weaved storyline of what took place even longer ago in the galaxy crafted since the original Star Wars. While most critics are quick to judge, watching this film shows that the direction was to show and set up how the Jedi came to be all extinct to line up the Saga with the original films. The politics do not bore in the slightest as Sidious plots out how he plans to defeat the Jedi by using the galaxy's very own people against them. However, while this film was entertaining, it holds up mistakes - the biggest one clearly being the inclusion of Jar Jar Binks. The climax of the film brings together the future of how we may see the story of the Jedi's end and the birth of Darth Vader in a trilogy starter."
"May 21, 2018",0.5,"This movie sets the stage for a trilogy that disappointed me. The greatest failing in this movie, and for the trilogy as a whole, is a matter of pacing. A focus on CGI graphics over characters makes for a movie that cannot hold up."
"May 20, 2018",4.5,I love this movie!!!!
"May 20, 2018",2.5,Not great but it feels like a star wars movie looks lile a star wars movie and shows a world before the empire. Still fun to watch.
"May 20, 2018",5,"It has its flaws but overall, it's an engaging and entertaining movie that left me wanting to see more of what Star Wars had to offer.  The acting wasn't always great, but with the script they were given, it's hard to blame the actors.  Despite that, most of the characters in this movie were great.  The fights were amazing.  The action scenes were mostly great.  Some slow political processes in the movie, but they didn't take away from the movie.  They were important in explaining why things were happening the way they were.  Overall, it felt like a Star Wars movie and made me want more."
"May 20, 2018",4,Not as bad as everyone makes out.
"May 19, 2018",2,Jar jar. Midiclorians. Pod racing. A fight that lasts a few seconds. Nuff said.
"May 19, 2018",3,Better than Disney's Star Wars
"May 19, 2018",5,Loved this film - totally underrated by people who either haven't seen it or watched it as a kid. It has aged really well too.
"May 19, 2018",5,Great non Disney film
"May 19, 2018",4,"and the pod racing scene went on for too long. Other than that, though, an unfairly maligned good movie."
"May 19, 2018",5,"The Phantom Menace gets a lot of backlash for Jar Jar, but in the end, it is still a great star wars movie.  You get an incredible pod race scene, a great villian(who died too soon), an awesome lightsaber duel, and the Duel of the Fates is the best music in Star Wars."
"May 18, 2018",3.5,Not as strong of a start as one had hoped but it does at least introduce you to Anakin and Kenobi plus more.
"May 18, 2018",5,loved the movie. too many people hop on the prequel hate band wagon. bet the good things defiently out shined the bad
"May 18, 2018",5,better than the crap the release now
"May 17, 2018",3,"I don't want to be mean. I understand that the actors were just doing their jobs. As far as that goes, they did their jobs well. But I can't stand the characters of Jar Jar and Anakin. They ruined a movie that could have been good."
"May 17, 2018",5,FEATUres the best lightsaber scene in all of Star Wars.
"May 17, 2018",3.5,"Probably an unpopular opinion. I actually liked The Phantom Menace.
Better than the fucking Sequels. Chris Stuckmann are you actually fucking retarded."
"May 16, 2018",3,"Boring at times,really interesting at other times..Introduced us to a great villain in Darth Maul."
"May 15, 2018",5,i loved this film i hope they do a backstory on darth maul
"May 09, 2018",1.5,"The Phantom Menace shows that Lucas forgot what made Star Wars great, with dull characters and a boring plot."
"May 09, 2018",3.5,"Just hate Jar JAR JAR ... WHY .. WHHHHY .. remove that thing and the movie would be a lot better. Kinda messed up with ""mediclorians"""
"May 07, 2018",4,"Best lightsaber battle of any Star Wars movie, with Revenge of the Sith a close 2nd."
"May 03, 2018",3,"""The Phantom Menace"" is easily the worst in the ""Star Wars"" Saga, but is still an enjoyable film."
"May 01, 2018",4.5,"A very nice start of the advanture, filled with action and good acting. Pod racing scene was just very painfull to watch."
"Apr 29, 2018",5,"Love all Originals and Prequels, wish I could say the same for the Sequels"
"Apr 27, 2018",3,"This movie is hands down, the most tragic and horrible films I think i've ever seen. The feel we got in the original trilogy is completely gone in this film, it was replaced by George Lucas' ideas for making star wars a children's toy. Although I would agree that star wars is   definetely favored by kinds, Luca way over did it. Overall the only appeasing thing about this film is the pod race, and the amazing lightsaber fight that blowed all of our minds. Unfortunetly, to get to the duel with Darth Maul, we need to go through 110 minutes of terrible acting, dialogue, humor, CGI, and script writing. The Phantom Menace was terrible, horrific and a crime to us all, thank you George Lucas for wrecking star wars."
"Apr 27, 2018",4,"Well the film had a couple of isolated details that could have been much better, but overall was a good experience. And I'm giving it a high score, because this film started the second wave of characters, worlds and situations that expanded the Star Wars universe. 
In retrospective the prequels did a great job presenting us new interesting and iconic things, places, situations, scenes and characters like Qui Gon, Mace Windu, Darth Maul. 
My favorite characters of the prequels were Obi Wan, Yoda and Palpatine, this films did a good job really making justice to those characters..........That's something that we cannot say with the new trilogy which is making so far a terrible work with the old characters, and specially with the most loved and important character in the whole Star Wars: Luke Skywalker."
"Apr 27, 2018",4,"Good Film overall, never going to please everyone, hated Jar Jar but i'm over it now, my Kids like him, and the film can be watched as a family. Lightsaber Battle with Darth Maul one of the best in the franchise, overall 4 stars. Revenge of the Sith is by far the worst film of the prequils not this. TLJ needs to be struck from Cannon, JJ open the next film with Poe waking up saying I had a bad dream, and ignore it all. or we will ignore star wars from now on."
"Apr 25, 2018",1,I honestly think that this movie sucked. there was a total of 2 good scenes (pod-race and Maul fight scene) but besides that it is just boring to watch.
"Apr 25, 2018",2.5,Well at least the final Lightsaber battle was good. 
"Apr 25, 2018",2,Poor start only saved by the duel of the fates....
"Apr 24, 2018",4,"Not a perfect movie but adds a lot to the star wars lore. Padme, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul are great characters in the franchise."
"Apr 23, 2018",5,"Star wars: The Phantom menace brings many laughs in an elaborate and clever satire of the science/fiction fantasy genre, skillfully parodying ""the chosen one"" trope, and poking fun at major sci-fi staples such as star wars and spaceballs."
"Apr 22, 2018",5,"Despite this moive's rough diagloue, it expands the Star wars universe in perfect was: planets, people, the Jedi and Sith, as well as seting it up for more moives to come"
"Apr 21, 2018",5,I liked the movie. It introduced us to Darth Jar Jar people! I hope he comes back in ep.9.
"Apr 20, 2018",4.5,"Peel away the sheep cover and stop living by society’s opinion, and all of a sudden, you realize The Phantom Menace is a good Star Wars movie. For many years I’ve been preaching how TPM is not the worst Star Wars movie. I always got the same response, but after The Last Jedi came out, people started agreeing with me. The Phantom Menace is given a difficult task. The task is starting off one of the most prolific, profitable, known franchises of all time, all the while keeping the pace racing to cover the amount of story they had to cover in a trilogy. The movie starts quickly, and is action packed. Director and creator of Star Wars George Lucas did not hesitate in showing off the new Star Wars. Many hate on the movie for being “boring”. The movie, I’m reasonably lengthened segments, has quite sophisticated talks regarding negotiations, trade talks, and other politics. Non-star wars fans hate it, but must realize politics were a huge part of TPM time period and the Republic. The action scenes are fantastic. They leave you wanting more, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, played by legendary Liam Neeson, does as he does best and leads this movie, making it its best. Qui-Gon’s padiwan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, is played by Ewan McGregor. He shines as well, and now no one else shall be known as Obi-Wan than him. These 2 Jedi, two of the most important characters in the grand scheme of Star Wars, face off against a true Sith assassin, the apprentice to Darth Sidious, Darth Maul himself. Maul arises on Tatooine, in search of Padmè Amidala (Natalie Portman), young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and their ship. Qui-Gon Jinn senses the dark presence, saving Anakin for the time being and facing off against Darth Maul. Qui-Gon realizes, his green lightsaber connected against Maul’s double-bladed red one, that this is the first known Sith in over 1000 years. The Phantom Menace has brief moments where dialogue is clunky, especially in the first 15-20 minutes of the film. It seems Lucas wrote this portion earlier, and came back to the script. However, it is easily looked over and grows on the viewer over time. The only real negative of the movie is Jar Jar Binks, but even he is not too bad. The Phantom Menace kicks off the Stars Wars franchise with action, awe, and tragedy. Rating: 86% 4.5/5"
"Apr 15, 2018",5,Better then Last Jedi.
"Apr 15, 2018",3,"Kind of annoying at times, but honestly get hated on too much. It’s really not that bad and has some great moments like Pod Racing and the Darth Maul lightsaber fight"
"Apr 15, 2018",4,"Highly enjoyed this movie. Took off stars because young anakin was horrible; and pod racing sucked. Although anakin blowing up the trade federation blockade was awesome. Parts I loved, the huge palace battle. Always loved the Naboo royal guard, only place that seems to have a decent fighting force against the droids, other than clones. The Naboo Air Force ships are awesome as well. Plus, the best part was obi wan killing maul. Watched this movie many times! "
"Apr 15, 2018",3.5,"Star Wars The Phantom Menace was a pretty good movie I was hoping for more action and battle but I know that the Trilogy gets better. There is the Jedi that make peace and justice, and there is the Sith they are all about power along with revenge. Now there is this young boy named Anakin Skywalker who may be a Jedi find out what will happen Star Wars is a good Trilogy"
"Apr 12, 2018",5,Underreted only for stupid nostalgic fans. But EP 1 is madre by the love of the author.
"Apr 11, 2018",0.5,The whole movie was just boring. Didn't hold up to the original trilogy.
"Apr 07, 2018",1,"One of the biggest disappointments ever. The CGI is over-used and terrible, the characters and boring and borderline frustrating. Whilst it has a good score and practical elements, it falls flat of any emotion and spoils the magic of the origional films."
"Apr 04, 2018",4,"You've got Qui Gon, Darth Maul, Duel of the Fates (Fight scene and music), young Obi Wan, the pod race, and practical effects. But this is the worst Star Wars movie? No.
Completely misunderstood and underappreciated. One of the best of the prequels."
"Apr 04, 2018",3,Most decent intro movie to among star wars trilogies
"Apr 04, 2018",2,"The film had some good ideas but ultimately the execution is poor with a bland story, dull new characters, an over-abundance of CGI and the character known as Jar-Jar Binks."
"Apr 03, 2018",2.5,"not kill me bad, but bad...."
"Apr 03, 2018",0.5,"Worst movie ever made. Sorry Lucas, it´s the reality."
"Apr 03, 2018",2.5,"Despite presenting with a brand new story, interesting political topics and delivering what probably remains as the best light saber fight in the entire franchise (choreography wise) and a very well shot and produced pod race, the film suffers heavily from poor dialogue and terrible pacing. The execution is very lackluster, but from very some unique visuals to a fantastic musical score, there's stuff to enjoy here."
"Apr 02, 2018",1.5,Ugh...urm epic musical score great light saber fights...
"Apr 01, 2018",1.5,Better than the attack of the clones
"Mar 31, 2018",3,Better than Attack of the Clones but still not what I was expecting 
"Mar 30, 2018",3.5,"This is a decent movie. Childhood nostalgia holds it up even as it drags on, and as long as you abide by the understanding that Jar Jar Binks is secretly a Sith Lord, it makes for a much better watch than some may have you think."
"Mar 30, 2018",5,You claim you hated it now but I saw you in the theatre cheering when Maul fought Quigon.
"Mar 26, 2018",5,"One of my all time favorites, Liam Neeson as a Jedi? yeah he nails it!"
"Mar 26, 2018",4,"As a kid I loved this film, as an adult? I still love this film, yes there's definitely problems but I think Lucas was allowed to make mistakes since it's his first time directing a Star Wars film since A New Hope and I was definitely entertained. Ewan McGregor was a great choice as Obi Wan, Darth Maul was awesome (even though I wish we got more of him), the Pod Race was cool, John Williams Score is amazing and I do admire Lucas for giving us something completely different than the Original Trilogy."
"Mar 26, 2018",3,"This wasn't the best Star Wars film, but at least there are pretty cool lightsaber battles!"
"Mar 25, 2018",3.5,"I like The Phantom Menace alot, and honestly i don't understand all the hate. People say it's slow and boring, but those are the same people who love ESB. They bash it for Jar Jar and gungans, but many of them liked Ewoks and Porgs. Darth Maul's story wasn't explored as much as it should be, and that's a real problem, movies are only as good as their villains are, which the guy who created Vader should understand. I would rate the movie 4 or higher if they put more focus on his character, instead of making him a villain of the week. Luckily Lucas understood his mistake and greenlit his resurrection in Clone Wars, but that's another Story. As for the rest of the characters that people criticize: many disliked Qui-Gon, but to me he's easily one of the most interesting Jedi masters. Little Anakin wasn't bad at all, Jake Lloyd was actually a really good child actor, and making his character older wouldn't have the same effect. Padme in her Geisha getup looks amazing, though i agree she lacks the charisma that Leia had, and Jar Jar wasn't  as bad as people say, especially now, knowing the original plans Lucas had for him, i can't help but enjoy his character. Obi-Wan wasn't given enough to do in the movie, but he more than made up for it in future installments. The Podrace was great, but the preparations leading to it kind of dragged a little, that was the only part of the movie i can see being slightly boring. Midichlorians didn't ruin the force, that's another thing most fans misunderstood. I think people expected Empire Strikes Back 2.0 but even more dark and brutal, and they got the exact opposite, a lighthearthed adventure movie targeted at children. Which wasn't a bad idea at all, there was an entire generation who grew up on the prequels and became fans because of them, me included. A movie targeted at older audience might not have the same effect."
"Mar 21, 2018",5,Qui-Gon Jinn dies. Darth Maul dies. Awesome movie
"Mar 20, 2018",2,"Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace is a movie that succeeds on the visual and action front adding  a great frontier to this movie. But, when you have mostly annoying and unbalanced characters, tedious politics sessions, terrible story and a lot of exposition, this movie falls flat quite quickly."
"Mar 19, 2018",2.5,"Two cultists find young boy and abduct him to enlist in cult, then fight satan with glowsticks"
"Mar 19, 2018",2,"A simply terrible movie. It should not even be mentioned in the same sentence with the original trilogy. Awful acting, incredibly cringeworthy to say the least, makes this movie hard to watch. The visuals are far from stunning. Films like The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, made only two years afterwards, puts this movie to shame. This movie at best, is shameful to the Star Wars saga."
"Mar 19, 2018",3.5,"I enjoyed it, very underrated film for having the best lightsaber duel of all time!!"
"Mar 18, 2018",4,"Is incredibly innovated with incredible backgrounds, has a kids comedy that felt very shocking because of the contrast with the political drama plot that has, also has sweet characters that felt real in it and good action sequences"
"Mar 17, 2018",2,"I so wanted this to be better!  But still, any Star Wars movie is better than most movies out there"
"Mar 15, 2018",5,Give this one more credit.  Lucas did a great job and this is the direction he wanted to go in.
"Mar 12, 2018",4.5,"When it came out the theaters were full for weeks. The bad comments didn't come till later when the Internet created the copy cats. Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn make it a great movie. The robots had to be show as an insufficient force, thus the need for the Clone army to be more effective. The technology and story couldn't outshine New Hope or it would seem like the galaxy when backward by the time of the Death Star. Thus Lucas walked that line.
Yes, Jar Jar and the Gungan's could have been done better, but the rest of the movie was strong."
"Mar 12, 2018",2,"Should have been better, so much of this movie could be cut out and you's loose nothing from the overall story. THough one of the best lightsaber fights in a Star Wars movie"
"Mar 11, 2018",2,worst sequel of all time
"Mar 11, 2018",3,Is it odd for me to like the pod race? 2nd to the light saber duel of cource ...
"Mar 10, 2018",4,"I appreciate this movie a lot more!!!!, after that mess of a movie that is Episode 8. "
"Mar 09, 2018",5,"Fun, exiting, with an interesting lore, star wars the phantom menace still managed to tell a better story than a large portion of storytelling today."
"Mar 07, 2018",5,cuando tenia 13 años me daba igual star wars pero ví esta pelicula y me empecé a viciar. soy de los que me gusta el episodio 1. mucho más que las de disney.
"Mar 06, 2018",5,"La amenaza fantasma se ha convertido en una cinta incomprendida,  principalmente por dos factores: los frikis de star wars y su poca amplitud de miras, y una critica reticente e impostadamente reacia a la ciencia ficción en general. Más allá de estos prejuicios injustos, subyace una película muy especial, que se yergue descomunal sobre todo lo demás. Su mayor logro tal vez sea confeccionar el mundo de ficción más maravilloso e interesante que el septimo arte haya visto jamás: Naboo. Un universo rebullente rebosante de magia y creatividad, con el reino como eje central de la trama. Es posiblemente el realengo naboo, con su preciosista y estilizada estética neo-renacentista, lo mejor que esta saga ha dado en tantas películas. No solo ofrece un majestuoso espectaculo visual, sino que además de su pompa fastuosa hay toda una reivindicación del mito de la diosa, encarnada por una Natalie Portman  imponente, solemne hasta la magnificiencia en sus galas de reina, y carismática heroína intrépida en sus escenas de  acción. Probablemente la parte del desierto sea la más farragosa; es la única pega: el no ver más de esa pompa bombátisca, que fuese tan breve contemplar esa elegancia, podriamos decir ya por derecho propio , ""nabusiana""."
"Mar 02, 2018",5,"Look, I know this movie has flaws.  I don't care.  I waited for this movie for years.  I devoured any information I could find out.  I wanted the second trilogy that Lucas had promised.  I knew it wasn't perfect, and at 19, I knew it couldn't be perfect.  It was fun!  It was so much fun because I wasn't stupid enough to whine about the minutia and just watch the damn movie and that badass podracing scene.  Oh, dear, the lightsaber battles are unemotional dances, and they are delightful, fast-paced kung-fu exhibitions.  You get the same from Chinese action films.  You don't complain about those!  Jar Jar Binks?  Yeah, there was too much of him, but I didn't dislike him.  There could have been less of him, but he wasn't a completely incompatible character.  Bad CGI?  It was all relatively new, and it was the best at the time.  Please, find me a movie from 1999 with better CGI.  Somehow, it's supposed to hold up to the 2010s?  This can't be the hill you're choosing to die on.  Star Wars has never been made for art critics.  It's made for people who want to switch their brains off and just have a blast, and if you can unpucker your asses long enough to stop whining problems that in the final order of things are entirely cosmetic (and I do understand that some can't) you might just actually enjoy it."
"Mar 01, 2018",3.5,"Another good star wars movie! Being a 1 year old when this movie came out, i had no baggage of the original trilogy when watching this movie, in fact i have no memories of seeing star wars for the first time, its just something i've always known about, but as far as i remember, this was the first Star Wars movie i ever saw (Probably around 4 years old when i first saw it). It entertained me then, and it still entertains me now. The light saber action is quick, innovative for the franchise, i loved the pod racing sequence, Jar Jar i found funny and Darth Maul was an awesome villain who, even though he lacks as an intellectual presence, makes up for it with his physical presence . Its also as if George knew that the senate scenes could lose the child audience, so in order to keep them, he tried to make what should be boring, as visually stimulating as possible. With all of the floating chairs and large variety of Aliens this kept me engaged. 

Revisiting this movie as an adult, not much has changed, Jar Jar is generally annoying but two gags still made me chuckle. As an adult now i fully understand all of the politics as well, which i didn't as a child. Chancellor Palpatine takes advantage of an already corrupt republic to put himself in a win win position. Under his Emperor guise he manipulates the greedy trade federation to invade in order to create a crisis. By getting the queen to sign his treaty making the invasion legal, the people of Naboo would still suffer and then the senate would no longer legally be able to intervene. So because of the ""Endless debating"" in the senate, he could have shown how the republic is ineffective and talks for too long rather than acts. He could then have moved for a vote of no confidence to secure his power under the promise of a strong republic that acts when others suffer. With the queen escaping, and coming to Coruscant and seeing how ineffective the republic is herself, Palpatine still got the same result. Very intricate and complex, and it goes further than this, but watching Palpatines subtle manipulations will always be a treat. It should also be noted, that if the trade federation was successful, then they could have controlled shipping to and from Naboo and therefore avoided taxation with this particular planet (so here is their motivations). 

But anyway, its nice that as an adult rewatching this there is still more layers to uncover. Obi-Wan, Padme, and Jar Jar each get complete arcs here, with a slice of Anakins overall arc shown via his leaving his mother and slavery behind and the Jedi treating him coldly, rigidly sticking to dogma rather than making some allowances to help Anakin who was already older than the usual students. Yoda is not yet the Yoda we know, while wise, he, like the rest of the Jedi around him, is quite arrogant, so he too learns things across this trilogy that forms him into the person we see in empire. Qui-Gon is the standout character though. Qui-Gon is a maverick, very much in tune with serving the will of the force, and being open minded. His peers assume they know everything about the force and have become more tied up in politics, and rely more on their technology to try and determine whether Anakin is the chosen one. Qui-Gon is more spiritual and reasonable, and often defies the council and the jedi code. He would have been a perfect master for Anakin, and had he not died, events in the saga would have unfolded very differently. Theres a reason the final fight is called ""The Duel of the Fates"".  There are two great articles on the character http://www.starwars.com/news/5-reasons-qui-gon-jinn-is-maybe-the-best-jedi ,  http://www.starwars.com/news/my-favorite-scene-qui-gon-waits

But that's enough of him. The practical effects in the movie looked great, but by 2018 standards, the gungans and battle droid CGI is looking a little dated, but the gungans at least can display emotion better than puppets. The acting at times can be a little wooden or monotone, but there could be reasonable in universe explanations for this. The Jedi by their upbringing are a little more disconnected from their emotions, more stoic, and Padme in her Queen guise uses a different voice that i'm assuming makes it easier for her decoys to emulate and therefore pose as her. The soundtrack is fantastic and audio editing spot on. The fight choreography is intense, it has an insane amount of great world-building, there is a lot to love here. For those complaining about Jar Jar, him and his antics cover only 10 minutes of the movie, and the trade talk and politics cover 12 minutes of the movie. Thats 22 minutes in a 136 minute movie. Thats 16% of a movie. Personally these don't bother me in the slightest, Jar Jar is entertaining for the kids, and you only have to go into your local pub to see that one of the most common topic is politics. And how could it not be political? Of the few prequel references in the original trilogy, we hear about the Clone Wars, the fall of Anakin, the Birth of the twins and A New Hope, tells us that the imperial senate was just dissolved, so this political direction was to be expected. This film strikes a good balance, there is plenty of stuff for the kids who are newcomers to the franchise to love and also Adults who have now grown up and need something more intricate to think about. This is actually my father's favorite film in the franchise. Its not perfect, but worth a watch."
"Feb 27, 2018",2.5,"John Williams score is the best of the trilogy, and the world building and lightsaber duels are cool. Poor cgi and of course, Jar Jar Binks, greatly affected the quality of this movie."
"Feb 26, 2018",3,"Star Wars the phantom menace was the 1st installment of the prequels. Technically speaking it is the worst, but in some ways I enjoyed it more than the other two movies. For one it doesn’t have any really intense or gory scenes, which I like. Yes, Darth maul gets chopped in half, and yes Qui-Gon gets stabbed, but it doesn’t bother me that much intensity wise. Jar Jar is also not that annoying. "
"Feb 26, 2018",0.5,The Last Jedi is better 
"Feb 25, 2018",2.5,Not the best movie (definitely not the best star wars movie ever) because it has way too much CG and not much variety in characters and has the worst character of all time (in star wars) jar jar binks.
"Feb 24, 2018",2,"Undeniably the worst Star Wars movie to date. It will be hard to make a movie this stiff, unfunny, cringe-inducing, uninteresting, bland movie that seems to be more compelled to create a Jedi C-Span with one good fight scene than to create a compelling Star Wars action movie. Ditch the politics and give me more Duel of Fates and this movie would be good."
"Feb 24, 2018",0.5,"You know what they say, everyone needs somewhere to sh#t,  I guess this is where George Lucas went.  Literally one of the worst films ever made other than the other two Star Wars prequels movies.  When you have to generate 2 different tv series to help unf#*@ the mess that is the prequels, you know you messed up."
"Feb 22, 2018",3,"Anyone can critique the prequel films for hours nonstop and make a lot of logical points. At the end of the day though, all of the prequels are still better than The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. The prequels had some of the best lightsaber duels and fight choreography in the series, the films didn't ruin already established characters (Han Solo, General Leia, Admiral Akbar, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, etc.), the films featured a lot of different characters the fans cared about so much, fantastic soundtrack, original plots, a lot of world-building showcasing the lore of the Star Wars universe, no Mary Sues or Gary Stus, and no SJW propaganda in sight. Sure characters such as Obi-Wan and Anakin had plot armor at times, but both lost in a duel against Count Dooku in Episode II. The dumbest scene in The Phantom Menace was little Anakin blowing up the battle droid control ship. He's a good pod-racer, but it's a bit stupid to see a kid that young accomplish what the adult, experienced pilots failed to do in the Naboo space battle. All in all, the pod-race scene, the Battle of Naboo between the gungans and battle droids, and the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon Jinn at the end of the film made it worth watching. The last half hour was great despite the idiotic scenes with Anakin. Perhaps, the film would have been better with less Jar Jar and an older Anakin."
"Feb 19, 2018",5,"aside from the boring politics and that annoying gungan, star wars episode i is a blast."
"Feb 17, 2018",0.5,THIS MOVIE SUCKED  SO BAD I MEAN WHAT THE HECK WERE THEY THINKING PUTTING THAT STUPID ANNOYING JAR JAR IN THIS MOVIE ALSO THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FIGHTING AND WHEN WE FINALLY GOT SOME ACTION IT SUCKED AND THEY BARLEY GAVE DARTH  MAUL ANY SCREEN TIME THE COOLEST THING IN THE MOVIE ONLY HAD 1 OR  2 LINES AND GOT VERY LITTLE SCREEN TIME! but that lightsaber duel at the end was awesome and the pod race was pretty good to but the bad scenes out way the good scenes by a landslide. I JUST REALLY HATED THIS MOVIE!
"Feb 17, 2018",2.5,"The Phantom Menace is a very disappointing Star Wars film...yet is somehow overhated. If you enjoy Star Wars you might have an ok time with it, but my recommendation would be to go on youtube and watch ""The Pod Race Scene"" As the film editing mixed with the visual effects in that scene alone makes this movie at least enjoyable at best.
 I'll give it 
         - 45%"
"Feb 16, 2018",1,"This movie seems like it is hardly ever re-watchable and is one that I wouldn't mind skipping on my seemingly almost monthly Star Wars marathons. From poor dialogue, to a cast without chemistry, to bad CGI and animation, this movie is all over the place. The dialogue in this movie, and famously with the Star Wars Prequels, are just cheesy and literally out of this world. From Anakin to Yoda, everyone gets their fair share of the George Lucas cheese dialogue spectacular. This cast on paper rocks and block buster, including Samuel L. Jackson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, and Keira Knightly. However, this star-studded cast, lacks a special dose of what many call, chemistry. The stale dialogue creates the acting to be stale and the movie suffers from the acting being poor. Lastly, the CGI and animation are just horrendous. The amount of time and care put into this was probably non-existent, or the movie ran out of budget to make it seem a little realistic. Overall, this movie is just a bore and is an easy movie to skip and pick up with Episode 2 in the marathons."

"Feb 16, 2018",3.5,"5 Year old me loved it, but I started to realize it's flaws as I got older. Then TFA and TLJ came out and made me realize how good I had it. At least the prequels add depth to the originals and Episode III was legitimately a really good movie. 

Cons:
- Slate dialogue. (2nd movie suffers from this too)
- Jar Jar. It seems like they added him for kids, but he really does kind of suck.
- Senate negotiations. Could've been better with better dialogue but just kind of boring

Pros:
- Cool action scenes (Pod race, Maul battle, others)
- Get to see beginnings of a lot of characters
- Has a plot/characters you can get into if you can get past the stale dialouge
- It's not TLJ"
"Feb 14, 2018",4,"The dialogue isn't as crisp as one would like to expect, and the middle act on tatooine was long and convoluted, however, it was a visual spectacle, and was able to develop characters that I cared about until the end. Burdened by my high expectations, it was still a disappointment, but a worthy installment in the star wars saga."
"Feb 12, 2018",2.5,"The so-called 'phantom edits' of this film prove the frustrating truth - it had so much potential, came close, and greatly disappointed. It had enough redeeming qualities to remain a 'decent' if patchy film, but it could have been so much more. George Lucas may be a great ideas man, but this film and it's successor really exposed the gaps in his skill-set. Frustrating but compelling viewing."
"Feb 12, 2018",3,"I am re-watching all of the Star Wars movies to cleanse my palette from the most recent one.

As much as this one in particular is panned, it had a well put together script, and the story was worth telling. The production values are easily on par with any modern movie, though the cinematography and storytelling is less bombastic that modern audiences are used to. The visuals and sound are fantastic as well, and really give you a good variety of settings to look at when the Republic was at it's height.

The only real problems with this movie stem from two factors. The first is the use of a child actor for the part of Anakin. If he was aged up a bit into his early teens, I think the performance would have been more natural, less creepy when played against Natalie Portman, and more believable as a whole with other minor tweaks. The other problem was Jar Jar, because of the slapstick physical comedy. If they had toned him down instead of amping him to 11 for the kids, I don't think people would have been particularly bothered.

It's still a very coherent story that sits firmly grounded in the universe enjoyed by many fans."
"Feb 12, 2018",3.5,"At first, this film may seem like a disappointment in the 'Star Wars' saga however watching it as a lone film puts it in a whole new perspective. Star Wars: The Phantom Menace may rely on big budget CGI action sequences but it certainly does it well. I give this film 72%."
"Feb 11, 2018",5,"Still better than the force awakens, and the last jedi...even with meesa in it........"
"Feb 09, 2018",5,Don't be put off by the bad reputation. Beautifully shot with great action sequences. The light saber duel at the end is probably the best in the entire series. Darth Maul is an excellent villain. Highly recommend!
"Feb 07, 2018",2,"While there are elements of this film that work, it ultimately feels unneccessary. I found myself zoning out through large swaths of this movie and ultimately didn't miss anything important to the overarching plot of the series. Jar Jar Binks, while meme-worthy, is a drain on this film, and the central conflict of the film is not terribly engaging or memorable. I send Jake Lloyd my condolences."
"Feb 06, 2018",5,"I am giving this 5 stars because I think there is a lot of overly harsh criticism of this film.  In reality, I would give it 3.5 to 4 stars.  I think you have to keep in perspective that this was more or less a film made for younger kids.  Yes, there were some points that were a bit lacking, such as Jar Jar Binks, the fact Anakin was a bit of a Mary Sue (but to be honest, he was more lucky than good).  It was a good start to the saga oveall, you meet the main characters, had good special affects (for it's time), and a classic musical score.  Overall, worth a watch."
"Feb 06, 2018",4,I confess I actually enjoyed the prequels. There are some things I wish were different but overall I like them. After seeing The Last Jedi I have an even greater appreciation for them. I saw this one on opening day with my brother and was not disappointed. There are some things that some may find tedious such as trade negotiations and some light politics (not like watching C-SPAN) but those are important in understanding how the clone wars started and the Republic was thrown into such disarray. It is overall very enjoyable with lightsabre duels that are better than anything in the OT. Character dialog could have been better as with all Star Wars movies but overall the points are made and the film is a fun watch.
"Feb 06, 2018",3.5,"I like this movie it was good but definitely not the best the second worst after The Clone Wars which was good but boring this movie offers us totally different characters such as Qui Gon Jinn, Padme Amidala and shows us who Obi Won was before the trilogy and adds up in the character young Anakin was well played by Jake Lloyd and Jar Jar Binks was terrible in this movie he was stupidly funny and dumb and this movie showed how things were before the empire I enjoyed it way more than The Clone Wars Darth Maul was awesome in this movie no exceptions. Overall It was a great movie but could have been better."

"Feb 01, 2018",5,It's Star Wars So I'm Giving It Five Stars!!
"Feb 01, 2018",2.5,Only two redeeming factors for this movie. The Pod Race and Darth Maul. Too bad they killed there coolest character and sent him off like a little baby. Apart from that this movie is absolutely boring. The lightsaber battles don't give you time to breathe and that isn't good because you don't feel any intensity. Overall this film is a huge disappointment. I liked it when I was 6 but I'm older now and I like to be my usual nit-picky self
"Jan 30, 2018",4.5,Underrated film. This should be viewed with greater appreciation now that Star Wars is in the hands of those who don't know what to do with it.
"Jan 30, 2018",3.5,"A great way to restart the series and introduce some of the politics and intrigue that got Palpatine in a position to be Emperor by the end of the Prequels. The pod race was way too long though. Heck, I even liked the Midichlorines."
"Jan 28, 2018",5,"An experimental epic space fantasy adventure with mystic knights, dark sorcerers, a young queen, laser gun fights, the magical force, the galaxy before the centralized Empire, and loads and loads of cgi."

"Jan 24, 2018",5,This movie don't get enough luv!
"Jan 24, 2018",5,"Even with Ja Ja Binks, far better than the abomination of The Last Jedi..."
"Jan 23, 2018",4.5,"Great movie overall, one annoying CGI character but loved the story over all. This one opens up many curiosities from the original trilogy and answers them. Great visuals with duals and origin of Jedi heroes. Setups up the next movie perfectly and has beautiful scenes throughout."
"Jan 23, 2018",4.5,"This movie gets a lot of hate, but when you take the time to step back and think about the Star Wars universe as a whole, this film is actually quite memorizing.

It beautifully introduces the Star Wars galaxy many years before the rebellion against the Sith, to a time when the Senate and the Jedi ruled the universe.  We meet incredible Jedi like Mace Windu and Yoda, and discover the reemergence of the Sith.

No, this film is not perfect by any means.  It came out in a time when CGI was still somewhat clunky, but if you can find a way to look past that, you'll realize how much this film brought life to the Star Wars series.  It introduced a whole new aspect of the universe that the originally trilogy could not do alone.  You can see the level of passion that went into making it.  Unlike episodes 7 and 8.

If you don't like this movie, watch it again with a more neutral stance.  Enjoy it for what it is and I assure you it will change your mind."
"Jan 21, 2018",2,"This movie fails in so many ways. Overuse of CGI, terrible scripting that wastes several great actors, the stupidity of everything Jar Jar Binks does, and way too many minutes spent talking about poorly-constructed space politics results in this movie falling flat on its face."
"Jan 20, 2018",2,"It's terrible but also pointless. If you really want to see prequels, skip it and start from the episode II"
"Jan 19, 2018",3,"The film that changes the myth of the Jedi to the legend of the Jedi.  Also the film that taught there's a degree of separation between expectation and actualization.  It was supposed to be a film about the rise of Darth Vader, but first we had to establish the good in him.  And Qui-Gon v. Darth Maul; the Noble Warrior against the Killer.  It also  has Natalie Portman's best performance in the prequels."
"Jan 18, 2018",3.5,"This is my least favorite Star Wars movies so far. The Phantom Menace definitely is disappointing considering the originals but it is still one of my favorite movies ever. Even though it is disappointing there are still thing that I find that I loved about this movie like the racing scene, Natalie Portman's portrayal of Padme Amidala, and the how we get to see what Anakin Skywalker aka Darth Vader was like when he was a child. The visual effects and animatronics are gorgeous and dazzling especially R2-D2. The makeup and costumes were done extremely well. The acting from Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, and Anthony Daniels was great. The voice over performance from Frank Oz was also great. The musical score was fantastic."

"Jan 17, 2018",4.5,"George Lucas' return to a galaxy far, far away is a triumph of creative vision. A movie that overcomes any and all of its narrative deficiencies through the pure drive of its creator to wow, thrill, and inspire."
"Jan 17, 2018",3.5,"This film is underrated! Sure, I could produce better CGI creatures with a potato; but the podracing is really good fun and Jake Lloyd's Anakin is actually pretty well acted. Obviously we're all bothered by the gungans, the endless senate meetings, and the weird jedi robot voices that Liam Neeson and Ewan McGreggor seemed to consider necessary. But I think Qui Gon is a great character, Queen Amadala is perfect and Darth Maul is a worthy villain. This movie suffered massively due to expectations and is by no means a masterpiece but it is perfectly watchable and entertaining."
"Jan 17, 2018",0.5,Hard to believe this was the work of the great George Lucas. I’m sure he finds that hard to believe too.
"Jan 17, 2018",4,This movie was really good.
"Jan 17, 2018",5,"Despite what everyone says THIS is a Star Wars movie. Yes it has lots of flaws. But I still like this movie.

I was a kid when this came out, I was 9 when i first saw it on VHS, in 2000 This became my all time favourite movie, i grew up on Star Wars, i lived for Star Wars.

This movie gave us great characters, such as Qui Son Ginn, and introduces us to the  second greatest villain of all time Darth Maul, and produces, in my opinion, the second greatest lightsaber duel (No.1 you'll have to read through my other reviews to find out, which).

For me, I came to dislike this movie instead of enjoying the moment and not overthink it, was when I started reading everyone else reviews/opinions.

Overall review of the story (As a 9year old) 
Awesome, funny, great fight scene way better than anything in the old trilogy.
Overall review (now):
I still watch it, i just fast forward all the political crap, skip Qui Got Chatting with Ani's mother and mainly watch it for the duel of the fates, for a terrific musical score. the Story is scattered, no focus on a single main character, too much talking not enough doing. and Honest Opinion on Jar Jar, i grew up laughing at him so to me he was and still isn't that bad, he's better than Rose in Episode 8. Her character is utterly cringeworthy.

My Edits:
1. Less talking, ""faster more, intense"" 
2.  Jar Jar, i think he was originally going to be Darth Plagueis. or some form of Dark Jedi, acting stupid, but he's the reason Darth Maul finds Anakin on Tatooine.
3. Focus on A main character, Instead of not really knowing who the main character is, The story should have been told through Obi Wan's perspective, giving us build up into Anakin.
4. Anakin Should have been older, a 9 to 14 year old age gap is a bit creepy.
5. In Episode 6, Obi Wan speaking to Luke ""when i first knew him, your father was already a great pilot..""
Episode 1, He had never won a race, not even finished. I think he needed to be a little better than that.
6. Don't kill off Darth Maul, only to bring him back in the clone wars tv show only.. 

From one fan to another, watch the prequels like your 9-10 year old self and enjoy it, don't over think it, don't do anything but watch. 
As a very influential being once said ""Do or do not, there is no try""

IF you want to judge the prequels, maybe should also look at judging the original trilogy in the same amount of detail. Episode 4 is about a whiny kid. Episode 5 ""nothing happens"" - George Lucas, Episode 6 the empire is defeated by Ewoks."
"Jan 16, 2018",2.5,"This movie gets far morenhate than it deserves. Grantedbits nowhere near the level of the original trilogy, it still makes for a fun time. And let's be honest, is Jar Jar Binks really any worse than the Ewoks?"
"Jan 16, 2018",5,people hate it only because Darth maul died but at least he died a great way
"Jan 16, 2018",4,"I see the points people dislike it, I see why JarJar is hated, but after the last jedi, people should rewatch. It isn't that bad.
I watched it multiple times, but I won't watch The Last Jedi ever again."
"Jan 15, 2018",3,"A solid Star Wars film with one fatal flaw, and other, more minor, inconveniences. You all know what I am talking about - Jar Jar is the dead weight tipping the scales from good to not-so-good movie."
"Jan 15, 2018",3.5,"Probably the weakest film in the franchise. It's between this and return of the Jedi for weakest entry.
However the film is still quite enjoyable and well made. The mythology is rich and the viewer is rewarded with the best lightsaber battle in the franchise."
"Jan 13, 2018",3,"This movie has its ups and downs. I frankly enjoy the first thirty minutes and the last thirty minutes of the movie the most, but in between it's alright. The movie starts off in a fun way in my opinion, seeing the jedi at a time when the order was still around and very prevalent in the galaxy was amazing and Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson do a fantastic job. The action is fun and fast, and John Williams score is brilliant. Of course, Jar Jar is a major downside of the movie. Not only is his dialogue and voice just awful but the CGI is extremely outdated. However, my least favorite part of this movie is Anakin and the Tatooine sequence. Contrary to most people, I do not care for the podrace at all because it's so long and really boring after the first two minutes. Jake Lloyd did a good job, for his age, but that doesn't mean I have to like his character. Darth Maul and the ""Phantom Menace"" that we later learn is Palpatine needed a much more involved role in the movie, but when they were on screen I absolutely loved it. As I said earlier, the last thirty minutes I really liked. It was action packed, amazingly scored, and just a blast to watch although it was occasionally cheesy. Overall I'd give it a 3/5 because of fun action scenes, amazing music, overall good acting, and amazing locations but also outdated CGI, extremely boring scenes, villains that did not get enough screentime, and overall shitty humor and characters that are aimed towards toddlers."
"Jan 13, 2018",3.5,"I definitely liked this movie, not my favorite of the saga though.  I loved the complex storytelling, and the story is especially engaging to me because I am fairly invested into the lore of the Star Wars universe.  John Williams' soundtrack is undoubtedly amazing.  The new locations (Naboo, Coruscant, etc) are also simply beautiful.  Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are acted perfectly, and their fight scene with Darth Maul was outstanding.  I also didn't really mind the politics aspect too much, I thought it was cool to see Palpatine's seemingly inconspicuous beginnings.  That being said, I could understand why a lot of people wouldn't like this movie.  There were parts of it that seemed to just drag on - most of what happened on Tatooine was just lame, young Anakin was just kinda strange, and the senate/jedi council shit is just too complex and boring for most people.  The podracing scene might have been kinda fun to watch but it felt like a useless time waster to me.  Darth Maul was a badass but still somewhat underdeveloped and underutilized.  Most of the CGI characters (ESPECIALLY JAR-JAR) were also just fucking abysmal.  Jar-Jar just did not work at all.  Speaking of the CGI, it might have been good for the time but it has definitely not aged well.  Overall it's an undoubtedly flawed but still enjoyable film."
"Jan 13, 2018",5,"I always liked elements of this film: the Music, especially Duel of Fates... Darth Maul... Qui-Gon Jinn... the pod racers themselves (though not the chase)... the whole look and design of Theeds and Naboo...  the three-way lightsaber duel.

But it was seeing Last Jedi that truly raised this film in my estimation!
Now it seem like a work of sheer genius in comparison!"
"Jan 13, 2018",3,"I'm with Paul C, and a lot of other people on this; The Last Jedi was disgraceful, so I decided to revisit The Phantom Menace, which I didn't really like much when it was released. However, after watching TPM tonight, the storytelling is so much better than The 'awful' Last Jedi. TPM has decent story telling, with some good ideas-a great cast, which can be under used at times. The saber battle scenes are great, as are the space scenes. The problems lay with using the Jar Jar character for comedy value-it's still annoying. The other problem is that there's the over reliance of CGI; The balance between costume, make-up, location sets, studio sets, against CGI, is all wrong. CGI should be used as an enhancement, and not complete substance, and that's where the movie partly fails; it just doesn't feel organic. And, Lucas isn't the best with dialogue, here. Aside from these glaring flaws, and a few more not mentioned, it's a reasonably enjoying movie."
"Jan 12, 2018",4,Not as good as the original trilogy but i loved it
"Jan 12, 2018",0.5,I've never been able to sit through this movie. I don't know what its about and I really don't care. Lucas really failed here.
"Jan 12, 2018",5,"Watching the contemptible monstrosity that is ""Last Jedi"" made me appreciate ""The Phantom Menace"". 
My fondness for this film has grown with time, where as my contempt for ""Last Jedi"" has already doubled in the month since its release. 

The lightsaber battle with Dark Maul is still the best choreography in any of the films. 
Liam Neeson's Qui Gon Jinn is a wonderful Jedi Knight.
Ewan does a good job of Obi Wan.
And yes, I DO love the pod race!"
"Jan 11, 2018",5,This is my fifth favorite Star Wars move and better than any Disney movie so far.
"Jan 11, 2018",3,better than the last jedi gets a 6.4/10
"Jan 11, 2018",5,Way better than the Last Jedi. It had amazing moments and actually had a plot.
"Jan 11, 2018",2,"I hope this doesn't make me a bad person, but am I the only one who sees racial stereotypes playing out in many of the characters, and E.T. in the senate?  Easily defeated, crappy plot lines, that condone the existance of slavery by ""the good"" side of the ""force"".. Hey, this kid is all emotional, might turn into a bad guy.. of course, we left his mother to suffer, but it's his fault he's traumatized and resorts to genocide when he himself has the power to do so, too late.. Story isn't terrible, just flimsy."
"Jan 10, 2018",2,"*sob* Why, George? What were you thinking? Midichlorians?! Politics?! JAR JAR BINKS?! NO! These do not belong in a Star Wars movie! The only good things about this movie are Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Darth Maul. Just avoid this movie."
"Jan 10, 2018",3,"I cannot in good faith put more than 3 stars, but wanted to add enough stars for RT to count it as ""fresh' from this review.  Having seen The Last Jedi, I can say in the Star Wars universe we definitely have a new low.  Rian Johnson has done something truly incredible, without any involvement whatsoever he has made the prequels better.  What a travesty TLJ turned out to be."
"Jan 10, 2018",5,"Going against the grain but I loved EP1 , granted was weak in a few places but was essentially true Star Wars , the j.williams score was amazing and the now iconic duel with Darth Maul for me is the best full stop ."
"Jan 09, 2018",5,Better than the last Jedi
"Jan 09, 2018",1.5,Too much CGI. Too much politics. Too much Jar Jar. WORST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER
"Jan 09, 2018",2,Childish... Very Weak argument...
"Jan 09, 2018",5,Those people who do not like that film have difficulties with intelligent and complex story telling. This movie has so much depth and fantastic interpretation of Star Wars. It definitively adds to the Star Wars universe and does not harm it like the new films from Disney.
"Jan 09, 2018",5,"Underrated and one of the best prequels 
This is another movie that give us so much more then meets the eye. One of the best light saber duels ever.
Liam neilson as qui-gon is amazing. There is soo many good one liners in this movie. The pod race is awesome . A lot went into making this movie. I highly recommend watching the making of this movie on the LucasFilms you tube channel. 
A very underrated movie that deserves more love for all the heart that was put into this film."
"Jan 09, 2018",2,Better than The Last Jedi.
"Jan 08, 2018",5,"Brilliant, compared with the new ones anyway."
"Jan 08, 2018",4.5,"Just finished watching star wars Phantom Menace again after all these years, And i really enjoyed it. George Lucas know how to tell a story that is meaningful and make sense. Phantom menace got a lot of bad press when it was released back in 1999 and i my self was disappointed at that time as well. however going back after all these years i really appreciated the plot and the story of this film. although i don't think this film is perfect,the empire strikes back is still my favorite film in the series. I came back to this film after the disastrous last Jedi  by  Rian Johnson's. Because i remember not being very fond phantom menace at the time of its release now going back i find my self appreciating George Lucas plot and story telling some great characters (except Jar Jar of course) his sense of magic and wonder that exists in this film it was still star wars. Disney thought they could do Better than George in making a star wars film, Well this time they failed and failed miserably (the Last Jedi). I felt JJ Abrams at least understood what star wars was all about and truly cared for the the films and loved the universe and characters that they belong in and there was an actual story in the film force awakens the film like a love letter to fans every where.  As for Rian Johnson's  well We know how the fans feel about this One Im sorry there is no excuse for the brutal plot and story in your film, this was not a high school English  writing class project this was a high budget feature film, and yes people can tell the difference believe it or not. (Game of thrones is not popular because of all the great CGI in the show the fantastic story telling may just have a little something to do with it.) May the Force be with you R.I.P.  

What i would love to see is George Lucas And JJ Abrams (force awakens) do the next film  and breath some life back into the franchise and Now that would be Something."
"Jan 08, 2018",5,"The prequels are a terrific return to the Star Wars universe. People do not appreciate the task of creating the entire universe in which the original Star Wars story takes place. In TPM, the extended stay in Tatooine, the discovery of Anakin, and the beginnings of the positioning of the pieces that brought about the empire and the return of the Sith rule, are masterful positioned. The people who so harshly criticize the actor who played Anakin are complete ingrates."
"Jan 07, 2018",4,"Loved the film, hated the Jar Jar And pod racing portions. The political strife felt interesting and didn't bore me. Loved whenever Qui-Gon And Obi-Wan were on screen. Overall it was an above average film. It kept me intrigue and interested in what was happening next. That final fight with Maul was also super cool."
"Jan 07, 2018",3.5,Admitadley one of the weaker entry's into the first six films.  It can get a little boring in the middle but in my opinion the duel of fates at the end is well worth the wait.
"Jan 07, 2018",5,This movie deserves a better wrap than it gets. Especially considering how disappointing I find the newest ones. Looking back Qui Gon jinn was the coolest Jedi in any of the 8 movies so far minus Yoda. A lot of the art was beautiful on Naboo as well. Also all the adults critics saying 'it won't appeal to kids' don't have a clue what they are saying. I saw this actually when I was like 10 and I though it was fantastic. I watched all the time on video too. Kids loving seeing their fantasy world flesh out as much as anyone and don't need only action and light sabers Christ.
"Jan 06, 2018",3,"Most of this movie is pretty boaring and it is a little silly. The story was not really interesting, however it had some incredible action scenes especially towards the end of the film. It also has some impressive visual effects. It's ok at best."
"Jan 06, 2018",4,better than the last jedi
"Jan 06, 2018",2,"I think the film perfectly sets up for the rest of the saga, an average boy selected by higher powers for a greater destiny... however that's what it's about-- the average boy. There are characters that are bad (ahem- Jar Jar) and everyone complains about the dialogue, however it IS a. space opera, the dialogue is supposed to be like that. Overall, great special effects, great battles, and and interesting political ascpect."
"Jan 05, 2018",5,better than the new disney stuff
"Jan 05, 2018",5,"I was angry about the original trilogy ""special edition"" when the prequel trilogy was released, and I didn't gave these a fair chance at the time. In contrast now to Kennedyfilm's fake sequels, George Lucas's prequels shine. Love Qui-Gon especially in this episode."
"Jan 04, 2018",3,"It's not as bad as they say, a family film with too much goofy humor. The kid is annoying as they are, most interesting characters are killed witch is kind of shame ,but it also kinda makes it the best prequel."
"Jan 04, 2018",3,"When I first watched this movie when it came out, I think a lot of it went over my head, all the politics aspect of it. However, now that I'm older, especially this past year, I've gone and watched all the prequel movies and find them entertaining. I get them now, and they (episode 1-6) all fit into a whole, complete awesome. I wish Episode 1 had made Anakin a little older, maybe pre-teen, cut down the podracing a little, add more Darth Maul and light saber duels. Less Jar Jar - or at least change his voice up so it's not so annoying, then he'd probably be a little more tolerable. I do like that Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan constantly rag on Jar Jar though. I like Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, Padme........little Anakin was good too, but i just wish they had made him a little older, maybe make both him and padme the same age (14)."
"Jan 03, 2018",0.5,Lo único bueno de la película es la pelea contra Darth Maul
"Jan 03, 2018",3,It's an ok movie but dragged on for too long. It gives a good indication of Anakin SKYWALKER who is very similar to Rey in the new Star Wars movies. Both working for scavengers. I feel there's something in this theory but still hasn't come out.
"Jan 03, 2018",3,"Too much politics, not enough good star wars action. Episode 2 manages this balance better. Also Jar Jar Binks."
"Jan 03, 2018",2.5,"It started well, fell in a heap and then tried picking itself up in the final act, but all too late. Maul is terribly underused and then there's the Jar Jar factor... the character would have been better in (much) smaller doses.  The pod racing scene went a bit too long, and some of the clunkers that were dropped (Midichlorians?) detract from a movie I'm sure every SW fan wanted to like."
"Jan 03, 2018",3.5,"Not a great movie. But I think the hatred for this film is a little overdone. It was my least favorite Star Wars film until I saw The Last Jedi, but at least it feels like a Star Wars film."
"Jan 03, 2018",4,"Underrated Star Wars movie. Star Wars has always been about the visuals and a rollicking style adventure and not some in-depth character analysis. Its a roller coaster not a mystery. box and in that vein this movie is excellent. The design was also stunning and while it suffers from what all Star Wars movies suffer (dialogue, ham acting, etc) it was a great addition to the Star Wars Universe."
"Jan 02, 2018",0.5,I knew this movie sucked within minutes.  What a disappointment.
"Dec 31, 2017",5,So much better than the Last Jedi. The Last Jedi has given me new found appreciation and love for this movie. I love this movie now. It is light years better than the Last Jedi which sucks @$$!!!
"Dec 31, 2017",4.5,TLJ makes the prequels looks like masterpieces in comparison.
"Dec 30, 2017",4,The least intolerable of the prequels and much more entertaining than The Last Jedi. 
"Dec 29, 2017",5,Classic. Simply the Best.
"Dec 29, 2017",3,"Good enough movie for a prequel which is supposed to tie in a backstory to the original trilogy. The plot makes sense, is consistent with the rest of the movies, and develops the characters backstories well. I very much enjoyed the building up the political situation, plus it was complex and realistic enough to be immersive and believable.  The move introduces many different worlds, technologies, and creatures beyond the trilogy, wonderful creativity and freshness. Fantastic battles and light saber fights. The pod race was fun.  On the negative side, I think Jar Jar got too much screen time and was more annoying than necessary. Although I didn't hate him as much as some others do. He was mildly amusing. The explanation for Midichlorians was unnecessary and unbelievable. They could have cut that whole detailed explanation out and just called midichlorians some genetic receptivity to the force. Excellent development of the Jedi council dynamics, and relationship to the Republic. Many more excellent things well done George!"
"Dec 29, 2017",2.5,"Colourful, beautiful, but overly padded."
"Dec 29, 2017",4,"Great movie for reboot the best saga in history. Liam Neeson was perfect as the teacher of Obi-wan Kenobi. Casting was great, Ewan McGregor was the perfect choice for a young Obi-wan Kenobi.
My only gripe, they killed one of the best villains in cinematic history, Darth Maul"
"Dec 29, 2017",3,"Maybe it's always been there, but I'm repeatedly struck by the stereotyping of dialects in this episode. Jarring; distracting.

That said, I thought it was a nice return of the franchise for the prequels. And, given that I've always thought of Star Wars as first and foremost a children's / family saga, I actually liked the Jar-Jar character."
"Dec 29, 2017",5,The most underrated film of all time.
"Dec 29, 2017",2.5,"I loved it when I was 10 years old, hated it when I was 20 and now I think its watchable. The CGI looks very dated now. Soundtrack is still fantastic. The Finale is worth watching the rest of the movie. Even with midichlorians, plot holes and too much space taxes and politics, it still stays mostly true to Star Wars, something you can not say about Episode 8.

5&gt;4&gt;6&gt;&gt;7&gt;R1&gt;3&gt;1&gt;2&gt;&gt;&gt;8"
"Dec 28, 2017",1.5,my favorite of the 3 but absolutely terrible
"Dec 28, 2017",3.5,My apologies to George Lucas.  His prequels tower above Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi
"Dec 28, 2017",5,My favorite star wars film hands down
"Dec 28, 2017",5,Deep story a world of suffering is hindered by a slow moving Senate which does nothing as two white knights are dispatched to save the day. The action is great the characters memorable and the score amazing I love this movie.
"Dec 28, 2017",2.5,Only reason I give this 2.5 stars is because the Maul vs Obi Wan/Jinn ending was awesome! This movie is only better than Attache of the Clones and The Last Jedi.
"Dec 27, 2017",0.5,"Terrible, should be removed from canon"
"Dec 26, 2017",2,Except from the ending really boring and bad. Unfortunately.
"Dec 24, 2017",1,"An Episode not worth watching, I gave it 3 chances but I doubt I will rack up 100 plus watches the way I did NH &amp; ESB"
"Dec 24, 2017",4,"I am in the minority of liking prequels. I don't think Jar Jar is as bad as everyone else seems to think. Take out a few scenes or change what he says and it is fine. There are a couple scenes with Anakin which could have been better, but all in all I really like the movie."
"Dec 24, 2017",1.5,"The second worst star wars. I don't know what they were thinking, but Maul was still cool, and I liked Obi Wan and Qui Gon. Anakin, Jar Jar, Midichlorians, and a bunch of other things are crap."
"Dec 24, 2017",0.5,Didn't like it at 13 hate it at 32
"Dec 24, 2017",0.5,M I D I C H L O R I A N S
"Dec 23, 2017",4,"I have always thought this was a good beginning. Jake Lloyd was good enough. Certainly way better than the kids they had play young Tom Riddle in Half Blood Prince. I guess it's hard to pick the kid that's going to grow up to be a villain. Soundtrack is very good, visual very good, the story is good, not great. Not a big fan of the midichlorians but I get that Lucas was trying to find some way to quantify how strong a being is with the force. It also makes sense that what was considered ""magic"" in the original trilogy due to the rise of them Sith Galactic Empire and destruction of the Jedi; now has more ""science"" behind it.
Qui Gon Jinn is number 3 on my all-time favorite list behind Vader and Luke now. 
Ewan McGregor does a great job, Obi Wan just is not my favorite character.
?Ian McDiarmid is great as Senator Palpatine.
Ray Park's Darth Maul is awesome though a little one dimensional. I think he should have been kept around longer.
Natalie Portman is very good as Padme Amidala. Not crazy about the idiotic system of government but I guess there are all kinds in the Galaxy.
I dislike Watto but he's more unpleasant than evil which I think is good. Anakin is not free but he's clearly not abused either. No one wants to see that. I guess it could be argued that if you don't want to portray the characters situation as horrible as it could be instead of this clean, sanitized version, then maybe you should could up with other circumstances for them.
It was nice to see Jabba in his prime.
I loved the Jedi Council but the first attempt at Yoda was awful! The changes they have made over the years have improved him.
Sam Jackson as Mace Windu is fantastic.
I don't care for the Gungans who are the new Ewoks but whatever. George Lucas has to have his whimsical characters so it's really the just the price of doing business with him. They are easily ignored.
Anyway, I thought it was a pretty good start."
"Dec 23, 2017",4,a under appreciated yet clever movie
"Dec 23, 2017",3,"Many mistakes, but better than people say/remember."
"Dec 23, 2017",4.5,"The Phantom Menace is a divisive film, to say the least. Fan expectations were extremely high in 1999 when the film was released. However, I'd say that it's by no means as bad as people think.

The Phantom Menace, the fourth Star Wars film but the first chronologically, follows Jedi Masters Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi as they help Queen Amidala save her planet of Naboo from invasion. Along their adventure, they meet Anakin Skywalker, who Qui-Gon believes to be the prophesied Chosen One that will bring balance to the Force. While the film seems inconsequential at first glance, it proves to be a worthwhile addition to the saga.

There are a few awkward lines here and there, but I find that the movie's plot, soundtrack, action, and effects more than make up for it. Qui-Gon, who we follow for most of the movie, is a rogue and idealistic Jedi. About midway through the movie, we get to see the other members of the Jedi Order and it's interesting to see how Qui-Gon clashes with their beliefs. Jar Jar Binks' (the controversial comic relief in the film) presence in the movie has definitely been exaggerated over the years. He by no means ruins the movie and even serves the story well by helping to set up the ending battle sequence. And I'm sure that most of you know already that the famous lightsaber battle at the end of the movie is well worth seeing. The film also benefits from the chemistry between Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson), Shmi Skywalker (Pernilla August), and Anakin (Jake Lloyd).

I think that Star Wars fans today would really benefit from giving the prequels another go. They really aren't as bad as most people think. The Phantom Menace provides an engaging and interesting plot combined with some of the best action in the saga."
"Dec 23, 2017",3,"Even with its flaws it feels like a star wars movie unlike the latest trilogy (Force Awakens, Last Jedi)."
"Dec 23, 2017",4.5,"With such an ambitious plot, it's easy to understand why forty-somethings wishing to recapture their childhood got so mad. This is a story for a new generation and a political and social commentary for the new millenium, while keeping that epic fairytale sensitivity to it."
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"I don't care too much for the looseness of the plot and how it unfolds.  That said, there are moments of greatness (e.g., the podrace scene, Darth Maul, etc.) that tug on your heartstrings like those old Hollywood epics...Also, say what you will about this movie, it IS original.  The sequel trilogy (i.e., Force Awakens) is not, and The Last Jedi takes WAY too many liberties with basic conceptual understandings of the force, jedi/sith, etc. (also Luke's character was mishandled horribly in The Last Jedi).  I'm giving this 5 stars because of my contempt for Star Wars marketed to the uninformed, millennial/Gen Z social media crowd."
"Dec 22, 2017",5,I love the prequels and no review can tell me otherwise
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"Phantom Menace looking pretty good right now after watching Last Jedi.. People panned these prequels, but honestly, compared to what Disney is putting out, these movies were gems.."
"Dec 22, 2017",5,It's very good movie
"Dec 22, 2017",5,everyone hates this one... but I like Qui Gon Jinn and the pod races
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"After Watching The Last Jedi, I came back to give this movie 5 stars. Im sorry Jake Lloyd"
"Dec 22, 2017",3,"O filme tem seus defeitos, mas as cenas são bem feitas, alem de muito bem coreografas. A cena das podracers é a melhor do filme, assim como a batalha de sabres de luz é boa. Apesar de tudo o enredo é redundante e faz pouco sentido. Alguns personagens são imuteis na trama e o próprio Kenobi poderia nem estar no filme..."
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"To be fair, the prequels (episodes 1-3) weren't so bad when compared with the the sequels (7-9). Of course though, nothing beats the Original Trilogy. (4-6)"
"Dec 22, 2017",4,This movie now seems much better after seeing the Last Jedi.  The Last Jedi now holds the title of the worst Star Wars movie.
"Dec 22, 2017",5,"Say what you will about Jar Jar, the movie is beautiful.  The locales, the characters, the vastness it adds to the Star Wars universe is worth far more to our beloved galaxy far, far away than any one individual character.  I hate that some bad lines and less-than-perfect characters are enough to relegate this wonderful trilogy to the pile as mediocre.  I love this movie, have seen it several times and never once understood why people hold quite so much antagonism toward it."
"Dec 22, 2017",4,I’m i the very few that like this Star Wars episode? Darth Maul light saber fighting scene is the best of all the Star Wars episode. 
"Dec 22, 2017",5,The main Star Wars movie. A pure masterpiece.
"Dec 21, 2017",1.5,"What is interesting about the prequels, which in my opinion fall short of the original, is that is is the brain child of the same director/producer creator, George Lucas.  yet at the same time, they don't measure up to what some fans, including myself, enjoyed about the original saga.  I think that Menace is probably the strongest of the three, I would rank them as 1. menace, 2. Revenge of the sith, 3. attack of the clones.   While there are dazzling scenes, incredible costumes, good choreographed light saber fights, Darth Maul is a great villain, and it was nice to see the Star Wars universe back on the big screen, the phantom menace pointed to a lurking future menace, and it turned out to be the next two films.  There was just too much thrown on to the screen, the jedi are shown having powers that they don't put to use in the rest of the movie, an overly complicated plot, the explanation of the force ""mediclorians"" or whatever they were called, the Jar Jar character that was annoying as heck.  One thing that has to be mentioned however, is the foresight Lucas seems to have had, as democracy dies in the republic and a power hungry selfish politician slowly consolidates power to become a dictator...hmmm who does that sound like?"
"Dec 21, 2017",3,"While entertaining at times, this film just wastes its material with stock characters and extended exposition. One word to describe this film: Disappointing."
"Dec 21, 2017",5,"Great movie love it but, needed more"
"Dec 21, 2017",3.5,"Very flawed (Jar Jar and some bad acting mostly), but fun. Great lightsaber duels and pod racing scenes. Liam Neeson is great."
"Dec 21, 2017",5,amazing start of the prequel of the three
"Dec 21, 2017",0.5,"Awful film from start to finish. Too many things to pick out that i hated...But the main thing that is lost is the look and feel of a Star wars film. This is so wide of the mark it should have been a sequel to the awful Ewok movies!
There are no redeeming qualities about this movie and as time passes it becomes worse and worse."
"Dec 21, 2017",4,Thats how you start a brand new trilogy for star wars
"Dec 21, 2017",3.5,"Just rewatched the prequels. They still don't hold a candle to the original trilogy, but at least they tell a story and have character arcs. If you can get past the Gungans, this is an enjoyable film overall."
"Dec 21, 2017",2,(Jar Jar Voice) Mesa Hate this movie. It hasa Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar ruin everything. Thin plot and horrific acting greatly hurtsa the movie.
"Dec 21, 2017",5,"The Phantom Menace is a highly underrated film. For starters the soundtrack is fantastic. Duel of the Fates is one of the best Star Wars themes. The cast including Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, and Natalie Portman is fantastic. I loved the Pod Race and arguably the greatest Jedi battle of all time with Darth Maul. I highly recommend the Novelization of Episode 1 for people who would like more story detail."
"Dec 20, 2017",4,Not as bad as everyone made it out to be
"Dec 20, 2017",5,My favourite Star Wars movie. People trash it but they aren't true fans.
"Dec 20, 2017",4.5,"while it has it's flaws, the phantom menace is a truly fantastic journey."
"Dec 20, 2017",5,loved this movie growing up.  brings me back to the glory days of Star Wars.
"Dec 20, 2017",2.5,There is only one reason to watch this movie: Darth Maul.
"Dec 20, 2017",2,"I've always had a soft spot for this film. It was the first Star Wars film I ever saw. However, it doesnt change the fact that this film has so many dull moment in it. The only saving grace of this film is the final battle between Qui-Gon Jin, Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul. Other than that the film had pointless plot lines and needless characters such as Qui Gon Jin and the hugely annoying Jar Jar Binks. I don't think it's the worse Star Wars film but it takes second place comfortably.

Final Score- 4/10"
"Dec 20, 2017",5,Some small flaws but still AMAZING!
"Dec 20, 2017",4,"Is this a perfect movie? not a chance. However I do enjoy seeing the Star Wars universe. I love Qui-Gon, young Obi-Wan, and dare I say it? Baby Anakin. For all the movie's faults, it does a good job expanding the Star Wars universe. I saw the movie opening night, and I will never forget the cheering that happened when R2 was introduced. 

The movie isn't perfect, pacing and some characters and off (looking at you Jar Jar). But the story was interesting, the world it created with enthralling and most importantly it felt good to see more of the Star Wars Universe."
"Dec 20, 2017",5,"Having just watched The Last Jedi, I've learned to appreciate the prequel movies. They are brilliant in comparison."
"Dec 20, 2017",3,I don't hate this movie like most people. It has a lot of issues and everything but I tend to enjoy it.
"Dec 20, 2017",4,"Though not without its flaws, the characters are memorable.  The story is compelling and leaves you wanting more.  The lightsaber-duel choreography is some of the best in the franchise."
"Dec 20, 2017",2,Meesa Jar Jar - enough said
"Dec 20, 2017",4,"Say what you want to say about the prequel trilogy.  However with George Lucas exercising complete creative control over the project its success or failure rested solely with him.  Unlike the company that now produces films based on characters he created.

Set 30+ years before the events of the original trilogy this film sees a young Obi Wan Kenobi and his Jedi mentor Qui-Gon Ginn attempt to mediate a trade dispute between the greedy trade federation and the small planet of Naboo.  However the dispute is a ruse set up by Darth Sidious.  And the Jedi must protect the young Queen Amadala as they attempt to make it to the capital world.

When their hyperdrive is destroyed they find themselves on the desert planet of Tatooine.  While they encounter a young Anakin Skywalker, a slave child with uncanny piloting and mechanical skills.  And Qui-Gon believes that Anakin is especially adept at the force.  The centerpiece of the movie revolves around Anakin entering a dangerous pod race as Qui-Gon Ginn manipulates Anakin's greedy master into wagering his freedom and a new hyperdrive on the race.  

The pod race truly is a spectacle to behold.  Each pod has a distinctive look and feel to it.  Each has a unique driver and pit crew.  This is a throwback to Lucas' love drag racing and cars.  And there is a lot of tension going into the race knowing what's at stake.  In the DVD and Blu Ray editions of the film the race is extended to show all three laps.  The theatrical version only shows about two laps.  It's also an opportunity to show Anakin's piloting skills.  And showing how resourceful he is when in the face of danger.  If only Lucas had transferred Anakin's demeanor in this sequence to the final space battle.  That could have created a more realistic sense of urgency for the young Jedi.

No longer bound by the technology of the 70s and 80s this film gave Lucas the chance to create a universe that was unique and different.  He was able to expand beyond the limited resources he had during the making of the original trilogy.  We got to the Senate at work and the Jedi at their prime.  The showdown between Kenobi and Ginn fighting Darth Maul is another high point of the movie.  We got to see fully trained and capable Jedis and Sith battle it out over multiple locations and see how powerful they actually were.  

Liam Neeson's presence as the elder Jedi brought a touch of class to the movie that is lacking in the Disney movies.  I don't want to get into the Jar Jar Binks controversy.  The concept of an all digital character is interesting.  However the execution and comic timing is out of place in a film that should be a bit more serious.  However his antics are still funnier than the forced humor in the Disney movies.  One thing that should have been added to the film was Count Dooku.  He just appeared out of nowhere in the second film.  It would have cool to see Christopher Lee on the council and seeing Anakin as the danger he is.  It could have been an interesting subplot with Dooku being one of the Jedis who denied Anakin a chance at becoming one.  It would have added more substance to their subsequent encounters over the next two movies.

Love him or hate him Lucas set out to make the movies he wanted to make.  And the Phantom Menace is pure Lucas, for better or worse."
"Dec 20, 2017",5,Awesome!!.. I love every single thing about the movie I really don't care what other people say but this is a Star Wars movie and this is a story that I really enjoyed
"Dec 19, 2017",5,"It might have cringe-worthy dialogues, but it gave us memorable scenes with the podrace and Darth Maul."
"Dec 19, 2017",3,"Groundbreaking visual effects are entertaining, but can't sustain a film alone. The heart of the story gets a bit lost in politics and action, and cold is the dialogue our talented cast is left to work with, but the magic of Star Wars remains"
"Dec 19, 2017",3,I have a newfound respect for this movie after seeing The Last Jedi.
"Dec 19, 2017",3,"Painfully average, feels the most like star wars, great fight choreography, amazing score, bland acting, unexciting script, criminally badass and underused villain, Jar Jar..."
"Dec 19, 2017",3.5,It's not great but it definitely gets a lot more hate than it deserves.
"Dec 19, 2017",2.5,"Look, we can all agree that the worst Star Wars is still better than the best movie that is not a Star Wars. An interestingly, we are able to test this theory by watching this movie, the worst Star Wars. It's bad, the acting is mind-numbing, and the plot is a mess. The Battle of the Fates is a great lightsaber fight, and Ewan and Liam do a lot of work to carry this movie, but they can only carry it so far. Jar Jar is an offensive disaster, and Watto is deeply problematic. But it's still a Star Wars, so include it in your re-watch marathons, just turn this one into a drinking game so that you can actually get through it."
"Dec 19, 2017",5,"Aside from the awful dialogue, it had some epic action scenes."
"Dec 19, 2017",5,Condenced sunshine of a childhood long gone.
"Dec 19, 2017",3.5,"Didn’t like the visuals, but I was entertained and intrigued by the story. It was awesome to see the Jedi, loved Obi-Wan. Jar jar is a silly character but I wasn’t too bothered. I only wished to see also an older Anakin not a kid the entire film. Darth Maul is a pretty cool character! "
"Dec 19, 2017",2,"What was Lucas thinking? A fantastic lightsaber duel doesn't save this film from Jar Jar, tariffs, bathroom humor, and a podrace that goes on and on and on..."
"Dec 19, 2017",3,"A rough but a workable star to the 2nd trilogy this movie suffers from some minor plot holes and questionable directions, not necessarily bad but probably not great idk.  A lot of people hated the politics between the trade federation and Naboo and the Republic i actually enjoyed it, it was a good way to see how the democracy of the galaxy worked with its advantages and flaws.  Some of that stuff was present in the originals as well but not to this extent, I do see peoples problem with that it feels like it stops the movie dead in its tracks but its trying to set up the rise of the Emperor, it probably could have been dealt with better.  What actually halts the movie and is not relevant to later movies is the pod race scene that could have been a lot shorter and had that time used for character development, the two jedi in this are very likeable and have there strengths and weakness, an ok into into the 2nd trilogy"
"Dec 19, 2017",4,I will gladly watch this film over TLJ any day of the week! Lucas at least respected the characters and their stories in every film.
"Dec 19, 2017",5,"This movie has grown on me and I really do appreciate its release.If this movie had not released I probably would not be a Star Wars fan to this day! Now that that’s cleared up is this movie good,yes! Why? Because it reintroduced Star Wars to a new generation (myself included)which made new future Star Wars fans! Is this better than The Last Jedi though,NO!! Ok Phantom menace is good but, The Last Jedi is classic Star Wars material even better than Force Awakens! So best to worst phantom menace is number 7 on my list ,when the classic masterpiece Last Jedi is number 2 on my list! (HATERS GONNA HATE!!!)"
"Dec 18, 2017",5,I love this movie. Amazing for original fans
"Dec 18, 2017",1,A full star because Darth Maul was interesting at least. Bad choreography and a closing cast of characters between Anakin and JarJar. It would be better if Disney disavowed episode 1-3.
"Dec 18, 2017",2,"We need a special edition that removes Jar Jar and tones down Anakin.  Then, this movie would be a lot better."
"Dec 18, 2017",4,"While many people hate on this movie I quite enjoy it. It has great visuals, great scenes like the pod race and light saber duel, and has an amazing soundtrack. I love Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon and Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan. Some of the dialogue is a little flat and the acting can be wooden at times. Jar Jar is annoying at times. Overall it's an entertaining movie that has some great action scenes and set pieces. "
"Dec 18, 2017",2,"A movie with bad lines,characters and CGI, however there are great lightsaber battles."
"Dec 18, 2017",5,"Best sword fight in the entire series!!!  Darth Maul is and awesome villain only
2nd to Darth Vader himself!"
"Dec 18, 2017",2,"Jar Jar should never have existed, or should have had a way smaller part. Darth Maul should have carried over to the middle of episode 3. Instead they just kept re inventing villains. Acting is forced, but I don't blame them, directing didn't give them any direction. Only reason it gets two stars is the world building was alright."
"Dec 18, 2017",3,"Puntaje Original: 5.5

Si se hubiera empezado a filmar Star Wars desde el episodio 1, esto hubiese sido una porquería."
"Dec 18, 2017",3,"I didn't hate the movie but it was disappointing. The acting wasn't great, the overuse of CGI, and Jar Jar were probably the things that I hated the most about this movie. The only thing that saved this movie for me was the Pod Race and Lightsaber fight at the end."
"Dec 18, 2017",4.5,"Outstanding. Rian Johnson's bold direction with Star Wars will go down as one of the most groundbreaking films of the franchise in the future, and will be seen as the moment the force became more than an overused, polarizing magic that drew a hard line between good and evil. Ridley, Driver, and Hamill put on a clinic with Driver leading the way in what, in my opinion, is the best performance in Star Wars since Ian McDiarmid's Palpatine. I am not saying anyone who didn't enjoy it is wrong, but I surely wish they would give this movie a chance to be what it is and what Star War's needed. A fresh, mold-breaking look at the force, the Jedi, the Sith, and the themes of balance and failure."
"Dec 18, 2017",4,Great movie with stunning visuals. Great light saber fight and pod race scene. Some the the acting is wooden and Jar Jar can be annoying. Overall it's an entertaining movie.

"Dec 18, 2017",1,"The plot doesn't make sense. Kylo Ren is angry for some unfathomable reason, and he isn't scary, he just has a perma-tantrum. I was never a huge Star Wars fan, but they just seem to get worse and worse."
"Dec 18, 2017",0.5,"This was the worst Star Wars movie in the franchise. Iâ(TM)ve been a fan of Star Wars since I was a child and saw A Nee Hope in the theater when it was first released. I thought The Force Awakens was pretty good and was fired up to see the sequel. I was utterly disappointed by The Last Jedi. It has killed Star Wars for me. The script was terrible and full of plot holes. I refused to watch âSolo: A Star Wars Storyâ? in protest of this heap of garbage called The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson ruined this film and treated the fans with massive amounts of disrespect. I feel bad for Mark Hamill for having to act in this film and watch his heroic character be reduced to a bumbling green milk drinking bafoon. They destroyed my hero, Luke Skywalker."
"Dec 18, 2017",5,I really liked this one. I feel that it is vastly underrated
"Dec 17, 2017",5,Masterpiece. There should be a enhanced version in a few years just to clear out some scenes and update some cgi and voila
"Dec 17, 2017",1,A near-total mistake. The fight scenes with Darth Maul are the close to the only redeeming feature of this film.
"Dec 17, 2017",3.5,"Certainly not the greatest SW film, but it gives great insight on Anakin’s early life and how Obi Wan becomes the most integral Jedi. I find many of the reviews to be biased when they say that “Jar Jar was too much.” Yes, he may have had too much screen time, but the character development and storyline advancement was impeccable. "
"Dec 17, 2017",0.5,"TPM was a B-rate film. The intro was fairly good as were parts of the ending. But largely we're treated to the Jar Jar and Watto show. Either of those characters are in almost every scene of this lackluster movie. It's all about a race for no apparently worthwhile reason. Climax of TPM looks like SW C-SPAN. 

There was remarkably little war in this Star Wars movie. Aside from that, the plot made no sense. First part was about an invasion, which is never explained. Second part was about a race to get parts, but we never see them fix the ship. Third part was about ending the occupation, which still was never explained. Darth Maul wears cheesy face-paint and horns, like a kid on Halloween. He's played by a dude who likes to show off his martial arts skills. That's it... he's a stupid gimmick.

Script was juvenile and irritating. Jar Jar wouldn't shut up. 9-year old kids make bad lead actors for SW movies. Overall it lacked personal relationships or any kind of investment. It had good visuals, but was pointless and dull, leaving nothing to build on. The only actor/actress who actually stick around for the next film might as well be extras through most the film. Since the other prequels sucked, there's no purpose to even watch this stupid movie. It's junk."
"Dec 17, 2017",4.5,"1k better than ""The Last Jedi"""
"Dec 17, 2017",3.5,"This movie gets a bad rap from a lot of people, but it's really not a bad movie. Is it different than what I wanted or expected? Yes. However, I enjoyed watching it when I saw it. I really like the characters of Qui-Gon and McGregor's Obi-Wan. Sure Jar-Jar is annoying, but come on. He doesn't ruin it. I think it's time people give their complaining a rest. This is a good movie and a decent addition to the Star Wars Franchise. It's not as good as the previous films, but it's not a bad movie."
"Dec 17, 2017",3.5,When I first saw this as a child it was a 4 out of 5 but it’s still better than episode 2 and 8. 
"Dec 17, 2017",2.5,"Not the best of the saga, but offers some great action sequences and one of the best saber duels in the franchise. Visuals don’t exactly hold up well today but it introduces new worlds and offers some creativity. The film suffers mostly from its political themes and slow pacing (particularly in Act 2) and mediocre performances particularly from Portman and Lloyd. Overall, an average sci fi film, but not necessarily the best Star Wars films. "
"Dec 17, 2017",5,"After watching episode VIII, which was terrible. I re watched these movies (episode I, II ,III)  and they are master peices. I miss George Lucas."
"Dec 17, 2017",5,It’s good.. ratings are wrong
"Dec 17, 2017",3,"The disdain for Jar-Jar makes no sense. Criticism of how cartoon like etc, or goofy left me to point out the Jim Henson muppets that litter the original 3 films. No difference. Young Anakin is interesting, but way to cocky, and McGregor casted as Obi-Wan is in my opinion the best casted person in all of this trilogy. I like the movie, is it my favorite, no, but I liked it for sure even all these years later."
"Dec 17, 2017",2.5,"The only reason this is getting two solid star is because there is some good acting and a great lightsaber duel, but the entry to the prequel universe is not a great start at all. Thanks to... Jar Jar, who is an unbearably unfunny and stupid character, this movie would EASILY get an other half a star if he was not in this movie."
"Dec 17, 2017",3,"Me gustó más que la II por el simple hecho de que aquí tenemos a Qui Gon Jin y un joven Obi Wan Kenobi, y un espectacular combate contra Darth Maul, un sith que aún hoy lo considero de los mejores de la saga.

Se nos presentan nuevos personajes que serán muy importantes en esta trilogía (y bueno, también formarán parte de las originales al situarse después a éstas cronológicamente).

Es mejor empezar por aquí para los que quieran iniciarse en la nueva saga, empezar por el orden que marcan las películas.

El niño Anakin carga bastante y Jar Jar Binks es lo más plasta y la peor idea que tuvieron los guionistas... pero bueno, al final hasta le cojes un poco de cariño y todo con el paso de los años."
"Dec 17, 2017",3,Clunky dialogue and space politics bog an otherwise good beginning for the prequel trilogy; Darth Maul and the podrace are the shining moments.
"Dec 17, 2017",4,I signed up for an RT account just to express my displeasure with TLJ. I feel compelled to show how much by giving PM a higher score!
"Dec 17, 2017",4,"Jar Jar Binks, Pod racing and terrible acting aside it helps set the stage and follows true to connecting the dots in the star wars universe.  It was great to learn more of mediclhorine counts and see the Jedi when they were truly at their peak.  One also cant forget how you felt when you first got to see Darth Maul have a double ended light saber.  Priceless!!"
"Dec 17, 2017",3,A tough entry back into the Star Wars universe. But true to the saga nonetheless. JarJar Binks and some otherwise boring dialogue get in the way too frequently but the action and performances from Obi Wan and Qui Gon are strong. Learning if Anakin’s origins is satisfying and so is the story of young(er) Sidious as Palpatine. Darth Maul needed more backstory and screen time. 
"Dec 16, 2017",3.5,"it was the best of the prequels, fight me"
"Dec 16, 2017",5,I love this movie. I don't care what anyone else thinks. I'm so happy it exists. 3rd favorite star wars film after episode 5 and 3.
"Dec 16, 2017",2.5,"An okay movie at best. With the cast given, could have been much better. Darth Maul should have been so much more. The human characters are lackluster and rather boring. Don’t even get me started on Jar Jar."
"Dec 16, 2017",5,Better than The Last Jedi. Rather watch Jar Jar than space Leia and Luke milk a sentient space walrus for its milk.
"Dec 16, 2017",4,amazing film action is good 
"Dec 16, 2017",1.5,"Bad plot, bad acting, but Darth Maul is awesome."
"Dec 16, 2017",2.5,"There were some great scenes in this movie even thought it’s one of my least favorites, some of them are the podracing scene and the Darth Maul lightsaber fight, also John Williams score is still amazing."
"Dec 16, 2017",1.5,"With so much hype surrounding it the Phantom Menace had the potential to become something great. Sadly, in 2017 the movie looks outdated, and the acting is poor as well."
"Dec 16, 2017",2.5,"Not as bad as most make it out to be, but still not a very faithful film, packed with annoying characters and horrible effects, it feels like no one was there to tell Lucas to just stop."
"Dec 16, 2017",4,"My three biggest problems with this film are that 1. Jar Jar Binks is not funny, only annoying 
2. Qui Gon Jin and Darth Maul are the most intriguing characters in the trilogy (because their backstories AND futures are unknown to us at time of first watch) but they are both killed in this, the first installment
3. Jake Lloyd's acting was less than ideal

That said, this wasn't The Last Jedi so I was pleased with it."
"Dec 16, 2017",5,Unapologetically love this film.
"Dec 16, 2017",0.5,Jar Jar and Medichlorines
"Dec 16, 2017",3.5,It's better if you think that Jar Jar is working for the dark side
"Dec 16, 2017",5,"This was the first Star Wars movie I've seen, when I was 5 years old. I have a special connection to this movie. The Duel of Fates song is amazing. The final duel is magical. QuiGon is a badass.
It may not be the best of Star Wars, but it has the Star Wars magic. 
The Last Jedi is the worst movie ever."
"Dec 16, 2017",5,So much better than The Last Jedi! I now have a better appreciation for the prequels after seeing that garbage! I would much rather take my homie Jar Jar than Porgs. 
"Dec 16, 2017",3.5,"Pluses:
-Original content including plot, charatcers and brand new planets,, worlds and species we haven't yet met.
-Qui Gon Jinn and Liam Neeson's performance
-Does a good job at recapturing the feeling of the originals
-Provides a good backstory for Anakin
-Very well executed duel with Darth Maul
-Great music from John Williams 


Minuses:
-Pod racing is a decent way to introduce Anakin, but the sequence is way too long. 
-8 year old Anakin ""accidentally"" destroys the entire command station. I understand he's strong with The Force but come-on. That is a bit of a stretch. 
-The droid army."
"Dec 16, 2017",2,"I wounder why even people consider this to be a Star Wars movie. Except for the final saber duel and the Darth Maul character, this movie has nothing to offer."
"Dec 16, 2017",2.5,a huge disappointment for star wars
"Dec 16, 2017",3,"The worst of the Star Wars films. A let down in so many ways. It was such a waste of some great actors. I love seeing the Jedi in their twilight but wow, this thing is a mess. And not a hot mess either."
"Dec 16, 2017",5,This movie at least connects with the Star Wars saga we know and love. Way better than the last Jedi 
"Dec 16, 2017",3.5,Best live action lightsaber fight we're ever going to see
"Dec 16, 2017",3,Most disappointing of the nine films. It could have been so much more. Yet somehow it's still got a magic to it that's hard to explain. 
"Dec 15, 2017",5,After seeing The Last Jedi I have a new found appreciation for this film. I'd take this and Jar Jar any day over what we got. 
"Dec 15, 2017",5,A million times better than The last Jedi. 
"Dec 15, 2017",1,With the exception of Darth Maul and a great end fight scene this movie is absolute garbage.
"Dec 15, 2017",5,I've always been a fan of starwars and this movie just brings all the hype back everytime I watch it!
"Dec 15, 2017",1,It's the only SW movie that I've never owned.
"Dec 15, 2017",3.5,"Visualization/Effects (Practical/Special) - 9/10
Acting - 8/10
Sound/Music - 8/10
Film Storyline - 3/10

Overall - 7/10

I understood the need to have the political side of Star Wars emerge as it sets up how the Original Trilogies Emperor gains his power.  This lays the foundation the Saga will be built upon, even with an over-the-top Jar Jar Binks."
"Dec 15, 2017",5,Better than TLJ for sure
"Dec 15, 2017",2.5,"This movie got a little boring with the politics and everything but honestly it isnt so bad once it reaches the climax, it honestly is a little unforgetable"
"Dec 15, 2017",5,"This movie gets such a bad rap, but if you really think about some of the exceptional elements of this movie, you can't give it anything but 5 stars. Sure, the lines are corny sometimes (though not as corny as many in the originals), and Jake Lloyd isn't the best kid actor, but the explanation of Anakin's character was brilliant. Qui-Gon Jinn is one of the most B.A. Jedi with strong force powers. The pod racing is exhilarating and well filmed. The insight into Obi Wan's character is satisfying for fans. The political elements develop important plot points for explaining the Star Wars universe (which The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are missing when it comes to the Republic and the First Order). And, of course, don't forget the most epic lightsaber battle in Star Wars (compare scenes, people) between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon and Obi Wan. In honest comparison with other Star Wars movies, this fits right in with the best of them."
"Dec 15, 2017",4.5,"Not perfect, but worthy of the Star Wars saga. Sets up many story threads that only fully payoff later, and a fun romp in itself."
"Dec 15, 2017",3,"Its great only thanks to Maul, race and music."
"Dec 15, 2017",5,"In retrospect, this movie is gold when compared to the Last Jedi."
"Dec 15, 2017",5,"I have found new love for the Prequels, We're sorry George, we miss you x"
"Dec 15, 2017",4,"While not the strongest of the Star Wars films, it hardly deserves some of the harsh reviews many have given it when it came out. Much of the expectation was much too high and it could never have lived up to the hype. There are plenty of annoying scenes such as the pod race which was overly long, and Jar Jar Binks. However it has some epic battle scenes (at least the Gungans lost the battle vs. Ewoks in Jedi) including an excellent lightsaber battle between Maul, Qui Gon Jin, and Obi Wan. The fact of the matter is that the movie has to spend alot of time laying the groundwork for the later movies including the originals so the quality hurts somewhat. That said however, on its own, the movie is good and does tie into the later films quite well."
"Dec 15, 2017",3,3.0/5.0 (underrated)
"Dec 13, 2017",3,"While The Phantom Menace is perhaps not the structurally sound adventure film that fans expected, it still delivers action and fun in places that perhaps the sequels in the prequel trilogy do not. 

Episode I takes a lot of risks and not all of them pay out. Dialog and performances seem oddly rigid, story and character threads seem a little misguided, though there's a grounded look and feel to this film that the sequels unfortunately lose entirely."
"Dec 12, 2017",2,"The Phantom Menace is a 'filler' episode in the Star Wars cinematic story line. It has a mostly boring plot  and was only saved by certain scenes that would re-awake me from my sleep. It was a required film in the canon, but could have been executed so much better. Not something I would re-watch."
"Dec 12, 2017",3,"Parts of the origin story were well done, but much more was done clumsily. A bloated script with limited action prevents Episode I from really shining."
"Dec 11, 2017",5,"The best star wars movie out there.

Some online voices have determined this movie isn't good, but how many of them have spent their off time sharing videos of acrobatic lightsaber duels? How many of them always talk about darth maul? They can say what they want, but this movie spawned the 2nd explosion of star wars, and helped create what it is still doing today by propelling it forward with the strongest force to date.

Backworld illegal podracing, exciting lightsaber fights, the best looking planet in the star wars saga, new style of lightsaber yet unexplored, 3 person duels, the best fight scene music in the saga, the most sleek starships of the saga, political intrigue, seeing the jedi order and how the jedi were before the 'dark times'.  Obi-wan as a padawan, and yes, if you a funny gungan who is in fact amusing if you put aside that online lemming hate.  

This is the best movie of the saga."
"Dec 11, 2017",2.5,"Though it's not a bad film by any means, The Phantom Menace kicks off the Prequel Trilogy to a very clunky start. Starts off being about the Trade Federation being upset about the taxation of trade routes, so they establish a blockade around Naboo. The Republic decides to negotiate with the Trade Federation by sending two Jedi to them, yet this freaks out the Neimodians and they attempt to kill the two Jedi. Then they bump into the worst Star Wars character ever conceived, Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar is a bumbling idiot that fails at being the comic relief. Then Anakin is coincidentally the creator of C-3PO (big whoop). George Lucas then completely ruins the idea/mysticism of the Force by introducing the midi-chlorians, microscopic organisms that fuel the Force. Overuses CGI that now looks severely dated. Darth Maul is an villain that uses a ""cool"" dual-bladed lightsaber to compensate for his underdevelopment. Anakin ""accidentally"" blows up the droid control ship, uttering terrible dialogue along the way. The podrace sequence served no plot purpose but only as a way for Lucas to show off the movie's visuals. But despite all these flaws, it left me in awe of both Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor)."
"Dec 10, 2017",0.5,Rushed and suck stick with the originals 
"Dec 10, 2017",2,"One fucking word, Jar Jar Binks"
"Dec 08, 2017",3.5,"Extremely far off from being as much of a timeless classic as the three original 'Star Wars' films, but also far off from being as bad as some criticisms may suggest. The first episode of the prequel trilogy remains the most underrated of the entire franchise. Its main flaws come from an infamously annoying and unfunny CGI character, a lack of backstory for the flashy villain, and some confused and underwritten politics. Despite all of this, when the film does work, it works to the maximum, and the good does outweigh the bad. Neeson and McGreggor are both very likable in their roles, the visual effects are as breakthrough for their time as the original film's were in 1977, and John Williams' score is as magnificent as ever (especially for the 'Duel of the Fates' sequence). A final lightsaber duel and a mind blowing 'pod race' are almost impossible to not find entertaining. Although 'Episode I' struggles to capture the essence that fans were used to, it is still a thrilling and visually dazzling adventure."
"Dec 08, 2017",2,This is the low of point of the Star Wars saga. It is not even a must watch to see episode 2
"Dec 08, 2017",2,character and personality take a back seat on this ride.
"Dec 07, 2017",3,Good start. More of a kid movie feel though. 
"Dec 03, 2017",3,Not bad. But the dismal Jar Jar made some of it unbearable.
"Nov 28, 2017",4,"Great pod racing, star fighter activity and lightsaber action at its best."
"Nov 26, 2017",5,"This movie is a fun reentry back into the Star Wars Franchise.  Say what you will about politics: if you're going to tell the story of the fall of a Republic into the creation of an empire, you would expect there to be the banality of politics, especially that of an asinine broken system, to be involved.  Fun Star Wars movie.  Vastly superior to The Force Awakens."
"Nov 26, 2017",3,"I thought this was pretty entertaining, but the plot is messy at times,, the dialog was off, full of exposition and the acting was most of the time cringey.The action is probably the best part about this movie(duel of fates). The politics are ok. But i like that this movie is original. Anakin is annoying and cheesy at times. The two jedi are fantastic the rest of the characters are ok. The cgi is so OVERUSED! it can be destracting at times, it is bad and unfinifinished most of the time evn for 1999."
"Nov 23, 2017",4.5,"Isn't this a little slow for a Star Wars movie? Sure, and I couldn't tell you who the main character is and I could use a few less scenes with jar jar and it's maybe a little disappointing overall compared to the orig trig but also PODRACING IS DOPE AND DARTH MAUL IS DOPE AND QUEEN AMIDALA IS DOPE AND QUIGON IS DOPE AND C3PO IS NAKED."
"Nov 22, 2017",2,THIS IS JUST BORING AND DISAPPOINTING. SORRY STAR WARS BUT THIS IS NOT FOR ME. DARTH MAUL IS THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THE MOVIE
"Nov 22, 2017",3.5,this movie is pretty good even if Its not as good as any other star wars movie it least it explains obi-wans backstory and introduces new characters without making a big mess out of it. all tho i wish it was a bit more dark and serious instead of the ''family friendly'' style.
"Nov 21, 2017",1,I choose the originals over this any day.
"Nov 18, 2017",2,"The cast isn't perfect, as Natalie Portman just doesn't feel like the right person to fill Padme. The Phantom Menace feels more modern, and more technological compared to the original trilogy. Not to mention, this is Star Wars's most political movie yet with trade federations that no one really enjoys. The movie's most hated character, Jar Jar Binks, who is a clumsy and ridiculous guy, plays a key role into advancing the plot. The plot advancing shouldn't be because of the most hated character of the Star Wars universe. Otherwise, not an enjoyable film."
"Nov 15, 2017",2,"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is the prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy, and in my opinion, it's not a good prequel at all. It took me a while to realize how bad this Star Wars film was because the first time I ever watched Star Wars, was this Star Wars movie. Ever since then, I never understood why people HATED this movie so much. I always thought that this movie was a pretty good and fun film, but it is nowhere near as good as the originals. After watching this movie for 6th time, I have to say that....... this movie is terrible. Now, I do think that some parts to this movie were pretty good and entertaining, but for the most part this movie was stupid and childish. First off, Jar Jar Binks as many have stated before, is probably the worst part to this movie. He's super annoying and horribly CGI. Secondly, Anakin Skywalker is another aspect of this film that is horrible. He's childish and not special at all. He’s just a random, normal kid that has nothing to do with all of the Jedi battles and situations that have to do with Jedi's. And lastly, we do not know anything about the character Qui-Gon Jinn - as if his whereabouts are unknown. This movie feels like if it was a late 80’s or 90’s VHS sci-fi movie for kids. It does not feel like a Star Wars movie at all. The battle sequences in this film feel as though I am watching a Cartoon Network film of Star Wars that ends up going straight to TV. Natalie Portman as the Princess was horrible and didn’t fit well. She was too young to play the role. It almost made me feel like I was watching a Robert Rodriguez Spy Kids film. However, while I have gone off on a tangent about this movie, there are some good aspects. I think that Ewan McGregor as OBI-Wan Kenobi was probably the best part of this film. He didn’t overact and understood his role. I also thought the scenes with Yoda were good and brought me back to the original trilogy. I think the parts with C-3P0 and R2-D2 were also reminiscent of the original trilogy. However, Star Wars, the Phantom Menace is still one of the weakest films of the franchise. While it does have some memorable scenes, all in all it does not hold up to it predecessors."
"Nov 13, 2017",4,"I don't understand all the hate for this movie. I liked it a lot as a child, and even now as an adult. The political side of the movie is a little hard too follow, especially for kids, but It's not that important. It's about Anakin after all. 
Jar jar was a bit stupid, but he's just a bit of comedic relief, which is welcome considering the political drama. Knowing who Vader was as a child tugs on my heart strings, and makes you want to find out how such a sweet little boy becomes so evil."
"Nov 12, 2017",3,Very childish and too many political conflicts.
"Nov 11, 2017",3,"Unpopular opinion: I don't hate The Phantom Menace. Now, does that mean I think it's a great movie? No, not at all. I tend to agree with many of the criticisms levered against the movie. However, I do think there are some positives that get lost in all of the complaining. Though much has been said of the acting here (and rightfully so, George Lucas didn't give his actors much to work with in his Prequel Trilogy), I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the performances of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. Something else I think flies under the radar is just how Episode I looks. In some cases, it is a pretty amazing looking film, perhaps even more so than Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. I don't necessarily know why, but I've always found this one to be very visually pleasing. The pod race sequence, though maybe a bit long, is just fun to look at. Same goes for the climatic duel/battle. I would also be in remiss if i didn't mention John Williams' score like everybody else, as he always brings his A-game. However, I will agree with a lot of the complaints that much of the acting is wooden, the plot regarding trade disputes can be wonky, the story choices regarding Anakin Skywalker, and of course, Jar Jar. Those are not ignorable (especially the last one), however, I think there is a lot in The Phantom Menace that keeps it from being the abysmal mess some make it out to be. I'm not saying it's on par with anything in the Original Trilogy or the new Disney-era movies, but let's be honest - you've seen movies that are a lot worse than this one."
"Nov 07, 2017",3,"The Phantom Menace is after all, a Star Wars movie. However, you can't ignore its many problems. The movie feels like it doesn't know where it has to go 95% of the time. It feels like the plot is lost and has no point that it has to reach by the end. Other problems in the movie are stock characters that play no extra part in the plot, other than make it seem more lost. The pacing is alright, but still doesn't save the messed up plot that cannot decide whether to focus on Anakin Skywalker, or the Gungans. Most of the dialogue also feels clanky and forced, or sometimes out of context. There are some good points, however. For example, the amazingly choreographed duel at the end of the movie, and the spectacular score by John Williams. The cast is mostly mediocre, with only Liam Neeson clearly standing out. All in all, ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"" is a goofy beginning to what should've been the best origin story of all time."

"Nov 01, 2017",3.5,A review of the 3d release https://crazydiscostu.wordpress.com/2016/08/22/star-wars-episode-1-3d-release/
"Oct 27, 2017",2.5,"(45/100)
Just not as good."
"Oct 25, 2017",1,"I was so disappointed in this movie. It looked like someone had got all the characters from movies like Trek, Alice in wonderland, and a dozen other movies with animated and peculiar characters and put them in the  blender. O yes then there was the kid in the fighter plane which we all know is to appeal to the pre teen gamers. Rehash of the old Star Wars but much much worse. Poor plot, indifferent acting."
"Oct 24, 2017",5,"A highly overly hated movies by idiotic crybabies who are stuck in nostalgia. This movie revolutionized special effects. And to people who don't understand cgi characters were portrayed by actors on set but digitalized. A great movie that is wrongly hated by people like jack f, peter z, shaun w, darrick l, ashton l, and niclas h."
"Oct 24, 2017",3.5,"Best of the ""new"" Star Wars Movies. Still a bit painful compared to the original trilogy, but good enough to still feel like Star Wars."
"Oct 23, 2017",0.5,"Star Wars The Phantom Menace: Dull, Boring and terribly done. Phantom meance brings the star wars franchise to new lows."
"Oct 21, 2017",2,"I needed an exorcism because of this film. 2* only because of Darth Maul. Terrible acting, but c'mon! That duel at the end made this film just about watchable. Maybe skip the entire film and just watch the Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon vs Darth Maul duel scene!"
"Oct 20, 2017",3.5,"Standing alone, Episode I is not a terrible film, with thrilling action scenes and (sometimes) enjoyable comic relief. That being said, it also has some terrible gags (cough Jar Jar cough) and the story is at times, choppy. Bottom line: A little bit of a runt of the litter, The Phantom Menace, unfortunately, does not live up to the greatness of its predecessors."
"Oct 15, 2017",5,"Originally I gave this movie a bad review, after watching the Last Jedi Garbage, I now like ALL the Prequels! Please forgive me George Lucas for Doubting you, PLEEEEASE!"
"Oct 11, 2017",5,I enjoyed this film don't understand the hate they made one mistake killing Darth maul apart from that fantastic movie
"Oct 11, 2017",3,"Didn't mind it but would have liked it more, if it would have been better with good cinematography and green screen. The acting was fine by the majority. The plot? can be questionable, but the first time I watched it I actually enjoyed it."
"Oct 09, 2017",2,"I kinda liked the pod race, and Darth Maul looked decent. Apart from that, the acting was awful, and the story was tiresome. The menace here is whoever okay'd this script."
"Oct 09, 2017",3,"With action scenes all over the place and some witty humor, I find this to be one of those those movies that, though it's not the best film in the world, I still find this to be enjoyable enough to watch a second time. My biggest complaint is that there are some really boring moments that take away from the entire movie itself. I'd still recommend a few people to watch it, you just have to have the right mentality to actually put up with it."
"Oct 08, 2017",5,Darth Maul. Qui Gon. Obi Wan. 
"Oct 08, 2017",1,Remove one character and the score would improve greatly.
"Oct 07, 2017",4.5,A new Star Wars from a past story for the next generation. Now nearly 20 years later we have a new trilogy for the NEXT generation. Star Wars all.
"Oct 04, 2017",2,Episode ll was worse but this sucks.
"Sep 21, 2017",3.5,"The Phantom Menace starts off the prequels of the Star Wars Saga, but lacks what the original trilogy had. I still love it because it shows why the original trilogy is happening, but it could've done better."
"Sep 12, 2017",2.5,"Unfairly maligned by a biased and entitled swarm of fanboys, The Phantom Menace boasts a strong cast that is mostly wasted. The characters that seem to be important really don't have much personality nor do they have an arc of any kind. The plot feels disjointed. Anakin, the supposed ""chosen one"", being written as a pre-adolescent is a big flaw that hurts the film along with shoving in a lame 3-year-old-pandering character like Jar Jar to be in the majority of the movie. The sound effects, worlds, costumes, set designs, alien specie designs, original score and overall production values are all very impressive and immersed me into this big fictional universe that hosts a space-fantasy. In conclusion, it is a mostly entertaining popcorn flick with some replay value."
"Sep 08, 2017",5,"The Phantom Menace is extremely underrated. Yes, it has some wooden acting and clunky dialogue, but hey, so did New Hope! As a whole the storytelling is intriguing and the world better is amazing."
"Sep 05, 2017",2.5,"With one of the overhyped movie at the time, The Phantom Menace didn't seem to have any connection. The characters that just came like that without any explanation or background make a lot of plot holes that appear. The good part is the setting up of the score but that doesn't change the fact that this movie has good points from it. The plot is ridiculous like watching cliche cartoons in general, the bad guy against the good guy without any explanation. The visual effects are horrendous with some aren't rendered as if they were not in there. It just a conservation and conservation. In all aspects, The Phantom Menace is one that doesn't have any connection with the trilogy and its monotonous feel as well."
"Sep 04, 2017",1.5,It's boring and I hate it.
"Sep 03, 2017",0.5,I hate the prequels. I hate this one the most.
"Sep 02, 2017",4,"Don't understand the hate for this film? Yes, it's not as good as the originals! Yes, Jar Jar is childish and not needed! Yes, cgi was used too much! But overall this was a fun film and is a hell of a lot better and far more original than Ster Wars: The Farce Engorges and Rogue Trash."
"Sep 02, 2017",1.5,It's boring and I hate it.
"Aug 31, 2017",3.5,"Phantom Menace was a good Star Wars film. It has got some stupid plots but music, great efects and very good action scenes are making this film great :)"
"Aug 23, 2017",2.5,Slightly better than Episode 2 but apart from a great Podrace sequence there's little else to enjoy.
"Aug 19, 2017",2.5,It was an ok movie but the story was bad
"Aug 19, 2017",1,"I remember the starwars movies being some of the best parts of my childhood, until George Lucas took a huge dump on them when he made the prequels."
"Aug 15, 2017",3,"The good out ways the bad in this movie for me. ""The Phantom Menace"" is not a perfect movie at all, but it does a good job of beginning a saga of soon to be nine films. 
 For more of my review of ""The Phantom Menace"" and movie news check out my blog at mtmovieblog.wixsite.com/mtmovieblog! It will be greatly appreciated!"
"Aug 14, 2017",2,"The Phantom Menace is the movie that, at the time, was ""the beginning of the end"". The characters and dialogue were beyond horrible, and the only people who might enjoy this are children and undemanding mega fans."
"Aug 14, 2017",2,"I liked the pod race, Darth Maul, and Liam Neeson. Everything else about this movie is garbage."
"Aug 11, 2017",2.5,"It could be a lot worse ... believe me! Off course, ""The Phantom Menace"" is responsable (as well as George Lucas' direction and decisions) of making the Star Wars prequels trilogy one of the most dissappointing trilogies in the cinema history. This movie is dumb, doll and just playing serious. The cast is good, but some actors are really badly used. Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson are playing himselves, but Jake Lloyd could be a lot worse. But Jar Jar Binks couldn't ... he just couldn't."
"Aug 10, 2017",3,"I enjoyed this film more than most of my fellow bros, in part because it has a lot of fantastic actors in it. 

George Lucas gives the cast terrible lines, and just CGI's it to death, but still the story was there. Darth Maul is the best part of this film, and a big mistake not making him the villain in the trilogy.

To have some beers with us and Watto, head on over to broforcesquad.com"
"Aug 06, 2017",5,One of my favorite movies of all time.
"Aug 03, 2017",3,"Even though the CGI is overused WAY TOO MUCH, even though this prequel has one of the worst Star Wars characters, who's NONE OTHER ELSE Jar Jar Binks, even though I don't like young Anakin in this prequel, even though I hate alien species, who are the Gungans, hear me out, but I don't think this prequel was that bad, guys. The CGI worlds in this movie like Naboo are honesty great, Liam Nesson as Qui-Gon and Evan McGregor as young Obi-Wan were pretty good Jedi roles, and also...DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON HOW GREAT DARTH MAUL IS!!! His Zabrak design was great and his personality as a Sith apprentice was great, everything I love about Maul is awesome. And plus, do I even need to mention probably one of the BEST scenes from the Star Wars franchise since the battle between Luke and Vader in Cloud City!? I honestly thought the movie was OK."
"Jul 30, 2017",3,"While The Phantom Menace does not nearly hold to the original trilogy, it does make anyone who loves Star Wars feel like they are back where they belong. The movie is loads of fun to watch with new improvements on CGI that the original trilogy could never have along with a great set of actors. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor shine as they prepare to embark on the new trilogy. The pod race scene was awesome to watch and the final battle against the menacing Darth Maul was almost like seeing a true lightsaber fight for the first time. One of the things this movie does very well is that it shows the audience what the Star Wars universe looked like before the rise of the Empire. There were jedi, sith lords, and the force was something that everyone was used to unlike the original's where Darth Vader was the only one who could use the Force. Yes, the movie had its moments where it was just not good, sometimes more than the times that it was. First of all, this movie did NOT have to be 2 hours and 11 minutes. The whole Coruscant scene took up about 40 minutes of this movie. Way too long! And some characters were more brought out than they needed to be a.k.a Jar Jar Binks. Lucas could've easily improved this by at least adding a little action into these scenes but unfortunately they were filled with political speeches. Who though Star Wars would turn into politics? Overall, The Phantom Menace was not a bad movie, but it wasn't anywhere close to great. I would recommend this movie to any true Star Wars fan but be warned, if you show any kid under 12 this movie, they may fall asleep when they hit Coruscant."
"Jul 23, 2017",3.5,dono how people can say this is a horrible film it was one of the best for its time
"Jul 20, 2017",2,"This a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise
I would not recommend this or attack of the clones this movie had potential and then jar jar bunks showed up"
"Jul 17, 2017",0.5,"""The Phantom Menace"" is not good film. In comparioson with the original trilogy the it was really disappointing. The film had a stunning cast like Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman or Ian McDiarmid, but they couldn't do their best having a really bad script. Their acting looks unrealistic because the main part of this film was shot on green screen. The film adds new uninteresting characters to the film and forced in characters from the original trilogy like C-3PO or R2-D2 doing nearly nothing for the uninteresting plot of the film which is about the taxation of trade routes.
In conclusion ""The Phantom Menace"" doesn't deserve to be called ""Star Wars"" and i it was'nt a film in the Star Wars Canon The Phantom Menace the film wouldn't be remembered as a film at all."
"Jul 17, 2017",2.5,"Bleh is a good way to describe this movie. Minus the maul scene, this movie is very forgettable. You could remove this from the saga and it wouldnt take one thing away for the whole scheme of star wars movie canon."
"Jul 15, 2017",2,"This was arguably the most anticipated film of all time when it was announced. The public had waited 16 years since Return of the Jedi for another Star Wars film and, unfortunately, it was a disappointment. The film on its own isn't terrible, but when compared to the original trilogy, it really is pretty bad. The characters are boring, stale, and lifeless. When you watch this film I challenge you to decipher who the main character is; that is an impossible task because there is none. The story has too many plotholes to count, and it never looked real due to the fact that half the time there was no real set, only a blue screen. Little Anakin Skywalker can be pretty annoying at times. Not to mention Jar Jar Binks, who is clearly there for comic relief (neither of which he delivers). The dialogue can be pretty bad at times too (""Are you an angel?"" being a prime example). The film does have some redeeming qualities. John Williams score is excellent, and the fight scenes were choreographed wonderfully. That about does it for the good parts of this film, though. Overall, Episode I is a blue screen mess with bad dialogue and plotholes galore, with a few nice touches here and there. Would not reccomend. Two stars."
"Jul 13, 2017",1.5,"Crappy CGI, ridiculous acting, an origin story that no one wanted to know and an assortment of needless, totally uninteresting scenes, from filler shots to boring conversations, all strung together in a clumsy manner. Jar Jar Binks wins the award of shittiest comic relief ever, worthy actors get good pay checks to say shitty lines in a shitty way and the characters are as flat as it gets. 135 very underwhelming minutes - plus a good one: the fight between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul."
"Jul 09, 2017",5,"I used to watch it when I was a little kid, my favourite is anakin."
"Jul 06, 2017",1.5,"3/10  The Phantom Menace is ambitious and has a few redeeming qualities, but it's ultimately mostly just boring and annoying."
"Jul 05, 2017",2.5,"Many people seem to think Attack Of The Clones is the worst movie out of ALL the Star Wars films, but in my opinion, The Phantom Menace is the worst one. I won't deny that the light saber battles are fun to watch, Darth Maul is a really cool villain, and the pod racing scene was pretty cool too, but the plot is so confusing, and the political dialogue only makes it even harder for me to follow."
"Jul 04, 2017",5,A amazing film not the best though
"Jul 02, 2017",2.5,"It had so much potential but was not what I came to expect from the SW franchise. Star Wars is an action, adventure franchise and there is too much politics in The Phantom Menace, not to mention the Jar Jar is completely unnecessary and could easily be removed."
"Jul 01, 2017",1.5,So boring huge letdown for star wars
"Jun 26, 2017",2,The only good part of this movie was darth maul. Everything else is just cringefest.
"Jun 25, 2017",3,"The Phantom Menace... Después de repetir con gusto la Original Trilogy, empiezo la Prequel Trilogy que parece un poco falsa con algunos de sus efectos, pero que tiene una buena historia. Lástima por sus Razzies. Pobre Jar Jar Binks, odiado por todos."
"Jun 25, 2017",5,"This movie exceeded my every expectation. Any one who doesn't enjoy it, is now an enemy of the Republic. The political subtleties gave an more in depth experience as to how the galaxy ended up in turmoil in the original trilogy.  The serious undertones from the less overt dialog gave the impression of the impeding doom for the Jedi, they could sense the dark side approaching, but could do nothing to stop it. Jar jar was not meant for a bunch of over-grown  toddlers projecting their nostalgia from the original trilogy, he was meant for actual toddlers to enjoy, which they did. This movie sets the stage for the entire galaxy of the Star Wars universe in a way I've never seen in another franchise. I'd give this movie as many stars as Anakin has midi-chlorians, off the charts. Thank you George for revitalizing this dearly beloved franchise, and have a moee moee bombad day!"
"Jun 21, 2017",3.5,This may not be the best of the Star Wars franchise but it has some interesting touches. The libsaber battle was AWESOME! and of course we can't forget that epic double bladed libsaber and Darth Maul. Nice movie.
"Jun 20, 2017",2,"The Phantom Menace brings some of the franchise's best characters on its big-budget space journey, only to bungle and at times even ruin the themes and ideas set by its predecessor. It's last big action sequence however is nothing short of choreography brilliance."
"Jun 17, 2017",2.5,"Action sequences were great. Darth Maul, podracing, it was all great. However, the rest of the movie was really boring"
"Jun 17, 2017",2.5,"Terrible dialogue, OK story. Anakin makes me cringe and Jar Jar makes me sick. It was decent."
"Jun 15, 2017",2.5,Fight scene at the end is up there as one of the best.  Everything else was long and drawn out. Lucas forgot his ways of the original.
"Jun 13, 2017",5,"Are you kidding me!  55%?!?!
The Phantom Menace is by no means the best Star Wars film, but it is not the worst either.  I didn't get to see the OT in theatres when they premiered, I did see the SE's when they came out, but it was TPM that gave me my official introduction to Star Wars.  Who cars about Jar Jar being in the film.  He's not racist, he's portrayed the way GL and the actor decided to portray him.  Is he a pointless character, of course, is he Star Wars, YES!!!!
TPM should hold a place in everyone's Star Wars heart, because had it not been for TPM, then that means GL was never going to bring Star Wars back."
"Jun 12, 2017",3,"Bad visuals and the young Anakin Skywalker was not good. Darth Maul was a neat character and the final fight scene between him Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon was good.

5.5/10"
"Jun 10, 2017",3,"Visually stunning yet narratively flawed, The Phantom Menace is action-packed and boasts compelling performances from Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor but George Lucas fails to bring that which the made the original trilogy so critically lauded to the first film in the prequel trilogy. Jar Jar Binks is obviously just a ploy to sell toys, Jake Lloyd was perhaps not the most ideal choice for young Anakin and Darth Maul doesn't get enough screen time. Before you go out and say ""Darth Vader only had 12 minutes of screen time in A New Hope"", remember that Tarkin was perhaps the real villain and Vader was just a decoy to manipulate the audience and the latter became a legitimate villain in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. In this case, although Maul appears in marketing, has a cool double-bladed lightsaber and kills a primary character, he never does anything that indeed screams out ""Fear me!"". And the infamous space politics. I'll just leave the complaints about those to people that are better at writing reviews than me. Personally, I think this film is slightly better than most people give the film credit for but it could've still been a whole lot better. You just had to go for that kiddie approach, didn't you, George?"
"Jun 10, 2017",2.5,"The prequels are cool, but I like the original better."
"Jun 03, 2017",3,The only reason this gets more than a half star is Darth Maul.
"Jun 02, 2017",3.5,"Although this film is despised by the majority of Star Wars fans, from Jar-Jar Binks to the Trade Federation. It gives us a good insight from looking at the rise of Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious. It shows that he was very manipulative in the Senate and managed to win power. Of course we know the evil Sith Lord was the figure-head of the Trade Federation. The introduction of Obi-Wan Kenobi was intriguing as well. I could not think of anyone better other than Ewan McGregor to pull off the role of the young Jedi Padawan. The introduction of new star systems were also key (Naboo and Coresuant) in the lead up to these prequels. It was also good seeing how the 2 main droids were introduced."
"Jun 01, 2017",3,Jar Jar was a bad idea. Darth Maul was a great one. The plot is lacking and we're all left wishing this one was better.
"May 31, 2017",1,"I never grew up on Star Wars, so I wasn't on the disappointment dis-hype train. But as an adult watching it for the first time, I can say that this was not only very dull, not only were the effects absolute garbage, but about halfway through, I actually yelled ""OH MY GOD, END ALREADY!!!"". Darth Maul was cool, though.

2/10"
"May 27, 2017",0.5,The original would have been much better if it had inter-galactic space politics and the taxation of trade routes. Simply riveting.
"May 26, 2017",0.5,"I found this movie pretty ordinary. I can't believe that this is a star Wars movie. It  didn't live up to my expectations.
This movie isn't nearly as good as the old ones





Knelanelas"
"May 22, 2017",1,"Here it is! The story no sane person ever asked for! This is the tale of young Anakin Skywalker, the boy who will one day become Darth Vader! 'The Phantom Menace' is a bad film. Its bad because it doesn't know if it wants to be a kids movie or something that will please fans of the original trilogy. Its bad because of the terrible dialogue and unconvincing acting. Its bad because of the use of horrendous CGI. Its bad because of Jar Jar Binks. Its bad because George Lucas doesn't really seem to have his heart in it. It is simply a bad film."
"May 16, 2017",2,"The story is tedious and not very engaging, the CGI is super fake-looking and sticks out like a sore thumb, the characters are bland and one-dimensional with a few notable exceptions, the acting is mostly bad, the dialogue is humiliating, and one side character in particular is really annoying and makes the entire film almost impossible to take seriously. One of the worst films in the entire Star Wars franchise."
"May 15, 2017",2.5,"By changing the mystery of the Force into biological terms, some of the majesty of the Force is robbed, but Episode I does improve visually, but that should not be something that is primarily supposed to carry this film. Weak storytelling, poor acting in some scenarios, and little logical reason for much of the political conflict leads to an extreme disappointment overall."
"May 06, 2017",2,"The Phantom Menace is without a doubt one of the worst live-action Star Wars films. It has a couple fun action sequences, but the majority is a boring slog of a film. I only watch it for the continuity. The film is ridiculously boring, with drawn-out political conversations. Normally, that wouldn't be as big a problem, but the dry dialogue in The Phantom Menace just makes it worse. Not only that, but the characters these conversations are between are so dull and underdeveloped. However, the action sequences (when we get them) are pretty fun. Also, the environments are really beautiful. The majority of the film take place on the planet of Naboo, and it is certainly stunning to see."
"May 04, 2017",2.5,"Is The Phantom Menace an abomination of cinema? No. Is it a master work made by the George Lucas of old? No. Simply put, The Phantom Menace is an underwhelming and boring movie with a few bright spots. These instances of light and levity come from a fantastic and underrated score from the great John Williams, and some terrific world building and action set pieces. George Lucas tries to break new grounds while also staying somewhat familiar to the sagas roots. To an extent he succeeds. The new planets he introduces are interesting. Coruscant is beautiful to look at and works as an excellent center of political affairs. The Jedi temple and the senate building in particular are well designed and show off some new aesthetics yet seen in the galaxy far, far away. However, while much of the film looks good on the surface, it suffers deeply from wooden characters and some less than stellar dialogue. It makes it hard to become invested in these new characters.One of which is the future Darth Vader. A stand out from the film is Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn. A Jedi Knight, and master to the young Obi-Wan Kenobi. He plays the character similar to a Ronin which offers stark contrasts with the Jedi Orders teachings. It is a shame we couldn't see more of this in the film. Instead we are treated to completely pointless and drawn out meetings of characters that seem bored to death. The only exception that stands out in these political debates is Palpatine, who is ""the phantom menace"". We see him begin his ascension to power in the political world as he plays a humble politician. He is the one behind the conflict of the film, the taxation of trade routes... blah blah. His plan is clever and his apprentice, Darth Maul, is a complete bad ass. The climatic duel with our two Jedi at the end of the film is among the best of the saga. The ""Duel of The Fates"" theme is also chilling. As I said, The Phantom Menace isn't horrible and it isn't great. It's a slow start for a trilogy that ends better than where it began. And I know I didn't mention Jar Jar in this review, you're welcome."
"May 03, 2017",1.5,THE WORST Star Wars film to date. Only good thing about this was Darth Maul.
"Apr 30, 2017",5,"Sorry, guys. But Phantom Menace is a good movie and Jar Jar is funny."
"Apr 30, 2017",3,"Hay muchas elementos del Episodio 1 que la hacen una de las peores entregas de la saga (de hecho es la segunda peor), y sin embargo no puedo evitar cierto cariño por ella. Quizás porque fue mi primera ""nueva"" película de la saga que pude ver en cines. Quizás sea por ese espíritu de epopeya fantástica que Lucas ya había implentado en trabajos anteriores y que a día de hoy está muy perdido.

Sí, el Episodio 1 tiene muchísimos problemas: de concepto, técnicos o directamente insultos a su propia mitología...pero siempre tendrá un rinconcito en mi corazón."
"Apr 29, 2017",2,"The Phantom Menace sucks, do not get me wrong. But I still find enjoyment in it for whatever reason. Maybe it's solely because how bad ass Darth Maul is, or Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan, that's all that I can really say I like. Jake Lloyd is very annoying and don't get me started on Jar Jar Binks. The movie blows, but I can still find areas of entertainment. Mininal, but still"
"Apr 27, 2017",5,this move is  brillent because the scene where qui jon  is trying to suduce watto is reminensent of the iraqi war because watto is a muslum  and quigon  is the usa and trying to influince watto through capitalisum lol its a joke
"Apr 17, 2017",2,"Boring, lifeless, poorly written and full of awful dialogue and cgi and uninteresting characters, The Phantom Menace is a mediocre movie."
"Apr 13, 2017",2.5,"A Star Wars film with a lot of potential severely spoiled by goofy characters, sounds and special effects. However some of the Star Wars magic does shine through with Ray Park stealing the show with his wushu martial arts skill, portraying Darth Maul. A character who really seems to capture the atmosphere of the dark side as Darth Vader did in the original.  The fight scenes with Darth Maul, Obi wan and Qiu Gon Jin are amazing and make the movie worth holding a spot in the Star Wars universe. I hope however in the future Disney manage to make a special edition of this and with all the green screen footage they took they could probably fix at least some of the goofyness like, Jar Jar, theâ&lt; Pod Racing  commentator ect. Well we can only hope..."
"Apr 09, 2017",3,"Long and slow, The Phantom Menace's poorly written dialogue is mostly made up for by strong action, decent performances, and dazzling visuals."
"Apr 09, 2017",2.5,Not terrible but not great.
"Apr 09, 2017",2.5,"''Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' becomes too buried in stale politics, and the cast does little to support the story given their dry and placid performances. Though the pod race is exciting it is the only time in the film where Lucas attempts to entertain the audience. The run time is unbearably long given the overall pacing issues and lack of interesting plot, resulting in a less-than-stellar addition to the Star Wars canon."
"Apr 06, 2017",1.5,"IT IS A DISAPPOINTMENT
although it has great visuals,podracing section and very few action sequences (like 2 or 3) but the boring plot and the bad acting by every cast especialy by the kid( he is the worst thing ever existed) make this movie a large disappointment"
"Apr 05, 2017",3,Complete crap other than the Darth Maul duel

STAR WARS EPISODE I - The Phantom Menace

One of the most hyped films ever, one of the most beloved franchises ever... Also turned out to be one of the most hated films ever. And I can see why! Odd pacing, god awful dialogue, terrible characters, the original Yoda puppet, Horrific CGI and don't get me started on Jar Jar Binks. But for me, there is a distinctive charm to this film that keeps on drawing me in. I love the premise, the fact that planets such as coruscant and naboo all had democracies as did so many of the planets seen before major war broke out. The trade federation, although not the main villain, were pretty menacing and the reliance on the battle droids show how arrogant they are. That brings me to the action... Pure cinematic gold. Although the editing could have been done better even else seems incredible. Obi-wan and Qui-Jonn VS Darth maul, The Naboo starfighters against the trade federation ships which to me appear as an early form of TIE Fighter, The ground battle of Naboo with the droids starts off well but does drop, And the pod race sequence. Unlike most, I prefer young Anakin to Hayden Christensen. The john williams score is by far the best part of this film, The genius stunned us with the original trilogy score but totally blew our heads of this time around. All of these make the film what it is. From a filmmakers view this film is utter garbage but from a fans point of view, I can't stop myself from loving it :D

However it still gets a 3/5 stars from me"
"Apr 02, 2017",5,I love this movie' it deserves no hate. That also goes for all the prequels.
"Mar 28, 2017",1.5,It's a terrible movie!
"Mar 24, 2017",4,"Episode I, is a travesty. It's an embarrassment to Star Wars and I can't really understand how they could've made something so cheesy and lame. The whole Jar Jar Binks and the frog king. And then they're stupid Jamaican accents. It's just so unnecessary and pointless. Like why did they have to go to that underwater world? They always try to use Jar Jar as a way to break tension or bring light humor but he always comes off as annoying. He's pointless, we could've honestly gotten by without Jar Jar.

I don't know what it is about the acting in this movie, but it seems so lackluster. Sometimes it seems like the actors don't want to be there and other times it feels like the delivery has zero emotion. The dialogue sometimes seems as though it was recorded in a studio and not on location. 

On the other hand, the special effects are pretty good I do have to say. Especially for 1999. Probably the best effects out during that time. You can tell that all the time went into that and nothing else. Hah! Just kidding. Kind of. I forgot how cool the racing scene was. How Anakin beat Sebulba was pretty clever. The different concepts for the pod racers was interesting to look at the sounds they made. 

Literally if there's only one thing worth watching in this whole movie, its the amazingly epic fight between Darth Maul, Obi Wan and Qui-Gon. I remember as a kid watching that whole sequence and just being amazed. John Williams' score hits so hard and it's so memorable. The reveal of Darth Maul and his double edged lightsaber is such a memorable moment. He's such a cool concept for a character. He looks so badass with his horns and face paint and his fighting style is impeccable. 

Overall though, this is probably the weakest of all the Star Wars movies. I feel like there was a lot of moments that didn't need to made the final cut of the movie. I feel like they could've either gotten rid of or replaced the whole Gungan concept along with Jar Jar and that dumb frog king. I think this is what really runs the movie in all. It makes it seems so childish and unnecessary. But, whatever. I guess you have to look past that to enjoy the movie."
"Mar 24, 2017",3,it has some fun elements
"Mar 23, 2017",2,"glad l was one watching star wars film and l only heard there fans might talking about were not compate prequel trilogy and the might have one the worst star wars movie, so all hand gesture all these have preview past which lm not haven't see it but l bought dvd disc replay there all old and new collecter have many nerd want check it out, and l only been there 3 location where there but trust me you see it. so then George lucas want audience to want it know it mail pack it which have another story back before star wars first one. George bail money 20 fox century kept idealization George try better truly where it how galaxy far far away. then he screw it."
"Mar 23, 2017",4,"It wasn't the best, but doesn't mean it wasn't good. Personally being a Star 
Wars fan, I liked it! The good acting and story makes up for bad acting Jar Jar."
"Mar 22, 2017",2.5,"A sad start to a new trilogy into one of my favorite franchises ever. The villain is amazing and some of the characters really work, such as Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan. But the narrative is just a struggle to get through. I found myself bored when Obi-Wan or Darth Maul were not present. Jar Jar Binks is just the worst character ever invented. George Lucas what were you thinking my man?"
"Mar 15, 2017",4.5,"Loads of fun from start to finish. The characters pop, the universe is built in a big way, and we get to see the glory days of the Jedi! Count me in!"
"Mar 13, 2017",3,"This movie has some good elements, like the Jedi, Darth Maul, and a lot of world building.  But it also had Jar Jar and kid Anakin.  It could have used some rewrites and another person keeping Lucas in check but it was still an alright movie.  But alright in such a classic franchise does't cut it.  The Last Jedi makes this movie look like citizen Kane in comparison."
"Mar 10, 2017",0.5,"Characters don't have characters, annoying kid, cgi bad even by 1999 standards, boring plot and I won't even go into Jar Jar. I don't even consider this a Star Wars movie."
"Mar 10, 2017",2,It was a bad time for Jedi.
"Mar 09, 2017",5,I enjoyed act 3 that's about it
"Mar 09, 2017",3,"Star Wars Saga's absurd order of the first, but in chronological order, the fourth part does not reach the level of the previous films, but the quality remains (at least in my opinion) the positive side. In this work on the Star Wars films most humorous point of view, but, fortunately, it works just fine.
The characters are once again strange, but the overall appearance is somewhat humorous, but it does not handicap much. Such orcs Viewing brings to mind a little bit hilarious opinions. 
Jar Jar Binks is still in the midst of these humorous creatures serious problem. Not that kind of foolish face and slurred and the yokel countries can not stand anyone, even if such a batty fool fell Viewing and misfortune seems a little funny. Nonetheless, quite reasonably good plot can catch up, and that's it time to pass, when only the opinion attached to the story of the new stuff (racing events), and, of course, good old-fashioned lightsaber battles."
"Mar 07, 2017",4,This prequel series can eat my shaft!
"Mar 06, 2017",2,"This movie is just not good even by 1999's standards. Before Rogue One was released, this was the only Star Wars movie I haven't seen (spin offs not included). I do not remember much about episode 2, but it's definitely worse than episode 3 from memory (I'll go over both movies when I get the chance to watch them again). The characters are bland, some actors sound bad or monotone, the effects look like they're out of an animated movie and not real (the CGI might have been good for back then), there's a lack of tension, the pod race was boring, jar jar binks was not funny (although I didn't get annoyed by him), and there was too much cluttered stuff. Oh yeah, the plot is all over the place and has holes. I great example of this is the council warns about Anakin possibly being evil and they later just accept. What?"
"Mar 04, 2017",1,"This movie has some cool visiuals in it.  There is a cool underwater chase sequence in there, and there is an epic lightsaber duel near the end.  That's it.  The computer generated Gungans, especially Jar Jar Binks, really took this movie off of a cliff.  Anakin as a child is just plain silly, the pod racing part looked cool, but the fighter pilot part was just too childish for me.  This is a kids movie."
"Mar 04, 2017",2,"Not a terrible movie, but the start of a new Star Wars-Trilogy could be better."
"Feb 27, 2017",1.5,"The Phantom Menace is a glorious piece of crap. It is the most disappointing movie I've ever seen in my life. The CGI in this film looks like a video game fresh out of 2002. Jar Jar Binks is the menace in this movie. Everything about him is terrible. Not only is Jar Jar terrible, everyone is. Everyone. Even Ian McDiarmid, who steps up his game only in Episode III. But everyone is just awful in this film. And back on CGI, the movie is filled with it. There is one shot in the whole movie that isn't bombarded with computer generated dung. The story makes no sense. At least not for a Star Wars movie. It shouldn't even be a movie because it doesn't add anything to the franchise's story except for how they found Anakin. I really hated The Phantom Menace and I don't understand why there is a lot of people who actually like it. It pains me to say that The Phantom Menace gets a 3/10."
"Feb 26, 2017",2,"Does this movie have anything to do with Darth Vader's origins? No!  Oh, and Jar Jar Binks, just fire him from Star Wars, okay?"
"Feb 23, 2017",0.5,"JAR-JAR!!!!!!!!
End of discussion."
"Feb 21, 2017",1.5,"This movie is not good, however it is not as bad as everyone says it is in my opinion. I think the real reason people hate this movie is that it's not just bad, but it was extremely disappointing, which granted it is. There is awful acting, awful CGI, awful characters, characters act like robots, ironically the robots feel more human. This movie also introduces Jar Jar, the worst character, not only in star wars, but ever. If you loved the original series, then I recommend it I guess. But if you're not a huge star wars fan, just skip the prequels."
"Feb 08, 2017",2,"Star wars the phantom menace not only managed to be one of the most disappointing films of all time, it didn't even manage to be a good star wars movie. Almost nothing works and 95% of the scenes are just boring. There's no characters developed, the CGI is terrible, it's boring, the acting is awful, and it never manages to entertain."
"Feb 04, 2017",4,"This movie gets a lot of flack that, frankly, I don't believe it deserves. It tries to experiment in ways that fans were not receptive of, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. People get hung up on what they didn't like so much that they miss all the good things happening in the background. Palpatine's rise to power begins with this movie, and when you take the time to pay attention to it, it's brilliant! No, it doesn't rise up to the original trilogy's level, but it is not bad."
"Jan 31, 2017",2.5,"From its unfathomable and dull opening crawl to it's boring politics, unremarkable characters and ropey dialogue, this is a hard sell for a Star Wars movie.

When you simply don't care who lives or dies, you know something is wrong.

Added to this, the overuse of CGI doesn't help and I have no idea why George Lucas seems to want the screen so busy all the time.

Good points. The woefully underused Darth Maul and the pod race."
"Jan 30, 2017",0.5,I hate this movie. It is so bad.
"Jan 24, 2017",4,"I adore most of this movie, but after the REALLY exciting action scenes finished, it kinda left me bored in the end."
"Jan 24, 2017",1.5,It just kind of happened...
"Jan 23, 2017",4,"my favorite star wars. jar jar hurt it from being a five star, but Darth maul is the best villain ever. fun movie."
"Jan 23, 2017",2.5,"This movie is very cartoonish and hard to watch, but it has a few strong points."
"Jan 23, 2017",4.5,My favourite of the three CGI crazy films. Great lightsabre battle at the end saves the slightly boring first half.
"Jan 22, 2017",5,"This is the best movie I have ever seen, any star wars fan would love this greatly made movie, I've watched this film over 10 times and the plot is rock solid, I also want to mention how this movie is NOT a cash grab from the movie studios."
"Jan 19, 2017",4,"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is a decent Star Wars film that effectively brings the saga into the new age of special effects and characters- from the fast paced lightsaber duels, to the impressive underwater city that the Gungans inhabit."
"Jan 16, 2017",2.5,"The for this movie is empty. It's slow, it has no character development and a plot you can easily get bored by."
"Jan 14, 2017",3.5,"I actually don't hate this movie.  And believe it or not, i hate threepio more than jar jar.  It just doesn't have the right feel for what a star wars movie really is.  Not the story, not the dialouge, not the humor, not the esthetic, and not the midi chlorians or whatever those were called."
"Jan 14, 2017",3,"The movie itself is decent, but as a Star Wars movie, it lacks a good beginning to the Star Wars franchise."
"Jan 14, 2017",1.5,"CGI effects, bad writing, horrendously wooden acting, annoying comedy, and racial stereotypes along with no story.  action scenes were fun though but Jar Jar Binks was racist and unfunny and Anakin was not even trying: i just said Screw You when he said now this is pod racing.  THIS IS NOT STAR WARS!! PLEASE REVIEW THIS, DOUG WALKER!!!!!!!  AAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!"
"Jan 11, 2017",3,Nota: 4.1/10 - 2.7/5
"Jan 08, 2017",5,"My personal all time favorite of all the saga. It is a shame that it has been Labeled to be the worst film ever and destroying people's childhood. With an open mind though, it is a dazzling film. All the political details in Episode I are nessesary to set up Palpatine's power grab. Anakin needs to be a young child because taking a 9 year old away from his mom is going to have a big effect. Exposition can be slow, but doesn't stop it from being FUN! Sure the CGI might be hard to look at by TODAY's standards, BUT that shouldn't stop people from enjoying what the movie has to offer. Jar Jar Binks is a funny character and can be distracting, but he still has a purpose in all of this. Star Wars is ment to be seen as a full saga of the Tragedy Of Carth Vader and his redemption. The Phantom Menace shows how Anakin's path to the dark side was almost inevitable from the start. From The Jedi Order narrow mindedness and fear of loss and his emotional connection to Padmé. Episode I has its place and offers new things we have never seen before in the Saga. The Podracer is exhilarating and the Senate scene is fun because you see how Palpatine is so mitiulate about how he will turn the Senate on Valorum's back. The Battle of Naboo on all 4 fronts is truly the best part of the film. A space battle just a cool as the ones in the originals and a big ground battle. Not to mention the epic Lightsaber duel and the Score. Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace doesn't deserve all the flack it gets and maybe you should go back and rewatch it with an open mind."
"Jan 08, 2017",0.5,"This movie has a terrible plot and awful dialogue and even worse acting, not too mention the contradictions between episodes 1 and 4!!"
"Jan 07, 2017",3,"Star Wars Episode I, the worst one. It is mainly bland besides they iconic Darth Maul fight scene and Podracing scene. It is overall a ""meh"" movie."
"Jan 07, 2017",4,"I am sad that so many people could not recognise greatness of this movie. Some said too much Tatooine time, but I love this planet so much and those races are so well done ! Of course Anakin is annoying (when grown up) and it was very clear even then that he will end up on dark side, he was rebelling constantly. Maybe this movie does not reach original trilogy still if we consider what kind of movies are getting over 60% rates and this movie got only 55% it hurts me  and makes me angry ! Carefully watch this movie and all beautifully done effects and story,  there is so much perfection, all looks totally realistic like you are there ! And no, not one minute was boring for me ! I am not saying this movie should get over 90%, but it should clearly get 70% at least and 75% most. Please try to do one thing, forget what others told about movie and just watch is with open mind and you will see movie so well made, George Lucas was so much insulted by this movie reviews and rates, and that was unjustful!"
"Jan 03, 2017",2,"I wanted to like this movie; some of the plot was interesting.  However, the computer animation was SO fake/corny that at times it seemed like I was watching a video game; not a movie. Maybe people who like video games like this movie; not me.  It's a lousy movie and the acting is devoid of any real emotion or drama."
"Jan 02, 2017",4,Underated! No its not a perfect movie and it is on the down side of the saga but the movie has substance even though it tends to lack emotion.
"Jan 02, 2017",3,"It's not too shabby. The negotiations are infamously boring. There's plenty of action fortunately, including an epic duel at the end of the film."
"Dec 31, 2016",2,"Expected to be the film that everyone has been waiting for since ""Return of the Jedi"". It unfortunately was filled with exposition and loads of stock characters. It was a bumpy start."
"Dec 29, 2016",2,"I won't lie, this film isn't quite as bad as everyone says, but it's certainly not good. A lot of people say the worst part is Jar-Jar, Anakin, the dialogue, the CGI, but for me the worst part is the pacing. Episode 4 felt like it had PERFECT pacing for a fun adventure film, but this film draaaaaged oooooon! The WORST was when they got to Tatooine. It felt like at least 1/2 of the film is spent on Tatooine, if not more. They could've cut SO much stuff from the Tatooine scenes, but they didn't and it shows! Even the pod-racing scene dragged on! At first it was like ""Oh cool! ... Okay, yeah, racing... Yeah, uh... racing... been going on for like 7 minutes now... Okay you can cut it out now!... STOP!... CUT TO SOMETHING ELSE!"" and my second biggest problem is the amount (or lack of) screen time Obi-Wan is given! What the hell, he was SUCH a major character in the original trilogy, why is friggin Qui-Gon the star of the show? Where did he even come from? He felt shoe-horned into the film! The villain looks cool, but he doesn't do anything interesting until the end of the film, but even then he gets killed off at the very end (Him coming back to life wasn't in Lucas's mind when making the film, so I'm not considering The Clone Wars in this review) aside from that, Jar-Jar is useless, the actor for Anakin isn't very good, and the only decent parts are the beginning and the end. And, as everyone points out, there's too much focus on the politics of Star Wars. I didn't know nor did I care what was going on in this film as a kid, now that I'm older, I know what's going on, but I still don't care."
"Dec 29, 2016",1.5,Fuckin Jar Jar Binks
"Dec 29, 2016",3,Objectively terrible but a hoot and a half.
"Dec 29, 2016",2.5,The movie drags on far longer than it should have. Tries to be comedic but most of the time ends up being annoying. The latter half of the movie was pretty good though which kind of makes up for the rest.
"Dec 27, 2016",3,"It was entertaining, but some of the writing was surprisingly bad. I can now see why people don't like Jar Jar. He is intended to bring comic relief but his shenanigans are just too much. The acting was pretty good but not the greatest. I definitely recommend watching this movie since it is part of the Star Wars universe."
"Dec 27, 2016",3,Failed to come close tonexpectations due to some stupid characters although it does offer an awesome fight between Kai-Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi vs the criminally negelected Darth Maul.
"Dec 27, 2016",2,the biggest issue is with the appaling acting of Ewan Mac Grugus
"Dec 26, 2016",1,Lord give me strength to continue on
"Dec 23, 2016",3,"Though there's good special effects and a couple good action sequences, it suffers from generic characters (and some annoying ones, *cough* Jar Jar *cough* Binks *cough*), sloppy pacing, and sometimes feels more like a political drama (a boring political drama at that) than a Star Wars movie. Not the best start, but not a terrible one for the prequels."
"Dec 22, 2016",3,"Though there's good special effects and a couple good action sequences, it suffers from generic characters (and some annoying ones), sloppy pacing, and sometimes feels more like a political drama (a boring political drama at that) than a Star Wars movie. Not terrible, but not the best start for the prequels."
"Dec 21, 2016",2,"As a whole, disappointing. The ending lightsaber duel is arguably the best in all of Star Wars to date, the space fight is decent, and the special effects throughout are fantastic, but it's not enough to justify watching all 2 hours. Most characters aren't interesting, and those that are rely on our knowledge of the original trilogy, instead of developing on screen. Not to mention the infamous Binks and all of the flat jokes that came with him. But the largest drawback is a lack of spirit that was at the center of the originals."
"Dec 21, 2016",1.5,"No.  Just...no.  You don't give a free pass to a movie where a planet with a stable government and economy elects a child as their head of state, monarch or president.  The only circumstance where a child is the ruling monarch of a stable country is in a hereditary monarchy, and whenever that happens the child never has any real power until he or she grows up.  In the meantime, a regent (e.g. Anne of Austria filling for Louis XIV of France) or a council of advisors who wield greater power (e.g. King Tut) should be set in place.  Never, under any circumstances, place executive power in the hands of a child, like what Naboo did when they elected 14-year-old Padme Amidala their Queen.  What the hell were they thinking?"
"Dec 21, 2016",5,"I beg to differ with the negative reception that The Phantom Menace receives. Despite Jar Jar being a horrible character everything else is top notch. Anakin is not a whinny teenager yet, the pod races are highly entertaining, and the final lightsaber battle with Darth Maul is one of the best Star Wars has to offer."
"Dec 20, 2016",2.5,"This movie would have been perfect but we just need more Jar-Jar, more Pod Racing, maybe ninjas would have been nice. What happened Lucas? It seems like Hasboro and a bunch of toy companies wanted you to keep adding unnecessary plots and characters to the film so you can make money. If you wanted Jar-Jar to be a sith you could have made us at least as viewers like him and not see him as that drunk uncle everyone hates. (Spoiler) You shouldn't have killed off Maul, in my opinion he is the most interesting Sith you have created. Overall, if you like a fun ride with poor execution and unanswered questions then this is your film. I love it only for the universe and nostalgia purposes."
"Dec 19, 2016",1,"I wanted to break stuff, but I did enjoy the music, costumes and Darth Maul (even though he couldn't act for sh*t). Jar Jar Binks made me suicidal ð???"
"Dec 17, 2016",4,"First half of movie is boring, but second half is interesting and epic."
"Dec 17, 2016",2,"There are very few movies (If any) that can say they had the hype momentum of this one. Due to this it's natural for one to think that a movie with such a build-up could fair better on re-watch with less expectations, that said Phantom Menace goes against the grain by getting worse every viewing experience due to an awful script. This dull prologue has little to no impact on the over all Star Wars experience, if you cut this movie from your Star Wars marathon you're missing out on nothing. The plot and characters are equally dry resulting in a bore that fails to capture any of the previous trilogy's thrills."
"Dec 16, 2016",0.5,"this movie needs to be eradicated! it doesn't exist. it just doesn't. hence we are missing episode 1. Walt Disney give us episode 1 please.  why can't I give this lower than a half star , they should have a - star rating as well for movies like this. Jar Jar Binks is a cross between Tweety bird and a Rastafarian. did Lucas not have any advisors saying ""hey, this is a bad idea""?"
"Dec 16, 2016",5,It was good could of been better if darth maul didn't die
"Dec 16, 2016",1.5,Horrible. Nothing more to say.
"Dec 16, 2016",1.5,"Such a waste of potential. While the effects are impressive and some of the action is well-done, it just lacks what made ""Star Wars"" so popular to begin with - i.e, memorable characters and good story. The characters are too flat to be worth caring about, and the plot moves needlessly slowly. Lucas seems to think that flashy visuals and a few callbacks to the originals will automatically recall the magic of the original films, but it's ultimately a disappointing and frustrating mess that pales in comparison to the movies that spawned it."
"Dec 16, 2016",5,"Greatly underrated. Lucas gives us a fuller vision of interstellar than in the original trilogy. The only bad note is Jar Jar Binks. But really, is he any sillier than C3PO?"
"Dec 15, 2016",3.5,"A very underrated Star Wars entry. It's story isn't nearly as convoluted as entries such as Episode II, keeping it simple, much like the original trilogy. It has some great ideas, such as introducing a never-before seen foray into SPACE POLITICS. Darth Maul is my personal favorite Sith Lord. The special effects are the best of the prequels, with the CGI looking good without overusing it. The practical effects are even more outstanding. Unfortunately, this movie still has problems. It is kind of boring at times, and don't get me started on the Planet Core scene. Otherwise, this is a great movie. Don't let other people try to tell you not to see it--its your opinion, after all."
"Dec 14, 2016",2,Of course it has it's moments but this film is hated worldwide for a reason. Overuse of computer animated effects and badly written characters drag this movie down way below it's potential.
"Dec 13, 2016",0.5,need to balance the score
"Dec 11, 2016",0.5,"Thanks for smashing my hopes as a kid Lucas. I thought this movie was terrible from day one, and hadn't watched it since I saw it in the theatre in 1999. My five year old son is a huge Star Wars fan and wanted to watch it. It is worse than a remembered and even my son thinks Jar-Jar is annoying. 

How could anyone have thought this movie was a good idea? It literally adds nothing to the story, the only decent part is the fight were Maul dies at the end. Avoid unless you like pointless drivel."
"Dec 11, 2016",5,"Ignore the haters, This movie is Fantastic in the sense of Lore and fantasy settings, It was new and fresh and the old critics just cant see how Epic it was, plus its much better then harry potter."
"Dec 07, 2016",2,"The weakest of the whole prequel trilogy, and probably THE worst star wars film! Only worth it for Darth Maul, otherwise the acting, pacing, and lack of action (UNTIL THE VERY END) is just meh!!"
"Dec 04, 2016",3,Disappointing and occasionally annoying.
"Dec 04, 2016",4,"Im going to be honest, i love the phantom menace. Is it perfect? No. But its still really fun to watch. I mean yeah jar jar is awful, but there are so many other awesome things about the film. It gets alot of hate, which i guess is understandable on some fronts , but i dont feel like it deserves all the hate it gets."
"Nov 28, 2016",2.5,Here we jump into the saga of the fall of the Republic from several viewpoints. It takes awhile to appreciate.
"Nov 25, 2016",1.5,"Phantom Menace suffers from political jargon, a deathly annoying side character, a strange love story, and an overload of CGI, but Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul are the highlight of the film."
"Nov 23, 2016",4,"Though the new characters in this first prequel are not so compelling as from the earlier chapters, The Phantom Menace boasts dazzling visuals and it manages to give the franchise a well-built background."
"Nov 15, 2016",2,"This movie did not live up to it's massive potential. And it's not because expectations were too high. It was just bad.

Now, I love this movie. It was my first Star Wars experience as a child and I've been hooked ever since. But now that I can objectively look back at this film as an adult, it's so clear to me why people disliked this movie so much. The worst part was the script. The script was garbage. Not even Liam Neeson, Ewen McGregor, and Samuel Jackson's exceptional acting capabilities could make up for it. There were only a few good scenes in this movie that could simply serve as an introduction to Attack of The Clones. Other than that, this movie barely contributes to the overarching plot of the Star Wars story. And don't even get me started on pod-racing, trade federations, and all of the other politics. Also, Jar Jar Binks was just terrible. Phantom Menace is definitely the worst film in the Star Wars saga, which is a shame considering the potential.

However, as I stated before, it was my first Star Wars experience that I still can obtain nostalgia from. So for that, I still can watch this movie without total dissatisfaction."

"Oct 28, 2016",2.5,"This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Now it's a bit of a guilty pleasure movie for me, but it builds to a kick-ass final showdown with characters that probably should've been shown more in the franchise (excluding Obi-Wan)."

"Oct 02, 2016",3,I really wanted to like this movie but I could only tolerate it.  The actors was so wooden and uninspired as to be boring and dull.  Only Liam Neeson's Qui-gon Jin saved this movie. Definitely not one of George Lucas' best efforts.
"Sep 27, 2016",5,"I loved every bit of it. why? well because it's well paced and offers a different story while maintaining the primary aspects of what a Star Wars film should be. the eastereggs were numerous, especially the last 2 minutes of the credit theme which is anakin's theme. and OMG I loved the look on Palpatine's face when Padme told him she's going back to Naboo."
"Sep 19, 2016",3.5,"Besides the disaster that is Jar-Jar Binks, the rest of the movie was very well done, the costumes, the characters, the politics, the plot and the sound track. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are brilliant together as master and apprentice."
"Sep 08, 2016",3.5,"Personally I don't think The Phantom Menace is as bad as everyone says it is. Even though it has a lot of shortcomings, I still recommend you watch it if you haven't already."
"Sep 06, 2016",1,A fart joke in a star wars movie? Wow.
"Sep 04, 2016",2,"This is easily the worst of the Star Wars films.  The special effects are visually ugly and unimpressive, the acting is plain bad, the action sequences are intensely but messily choreographed, the main villain is frustratingly wasted and Jar Jar Binks is outrageously annoying.  Kudos to acceptable  appearances of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, sadly in a Star Wars film in desperate need of a new hope."

"Aug 22, 2016",2.5,"This movie has two redeeming qualities, the pod race, and the fact that Darth Maul is arguably an even cooler villain than Darth Vader, and he's only in the film for twenty minutes, at most. Now there's a guy who needs a prequel made about him, get on it Disney. I want a Darth Maul prequel. You can pretty much skip the rest of the movie, because the rest of it is Natalie Portman delivering the worst performance of her career, bad CGI, and a suprisingly not so badass Liam Neeson. I mean, come on, how do you screw that up, but they did. 

I do not recommend this movie, but I would recommend a Darth Maul prequel without even seeing it, because he is that awesome."

"Aug 21, 2016",1.5,"If your expecting this part of the Star Wars franchise to live up to its predecessors then you should leave your expectations at the door. This film can be appreciated but only if you don't think of it as a Star Wars film. This film was never going to and will never live up to the original Star Wars trilogy. That does not mean that The Phantom Menace should not be watched, it is essentially worth watching as it still has its magical moments, however don't go into watching this expecting it to be the same edge of seat, inspiring and thrilling tale Star Wars once was. This still has its thrilling moments but instead is a rather bumpy start to an new era of Star Wars."
"Aug 20, 2016",0.5,Absolutely dull film. Awful wooden acting and terrible script. Nothing saves this film. 
"Aug 20, 2016",3,"Has A Lot  Of Flaws ""Cough"" Jar Jar Binks ""Cough""
But It's Kinda Fun"
"Aug 20, 2016",2.5,"I'm sure that everyone has heard of the complaints over the immense waste of computer generated imagery known as Jar-Jar Binks, but unfortunately, that's not this films only problem. Most of the scenes are tedious obligatory filler material of spectacular special effects sequences which are cringing to watch. I've heard that Lucas appalls writing as a whole. That being said, it has negative effect towards the film as it falls flat with it's story, characters and mostly dialogue which are explained to us by a tremendous amount of exposition. He insists that that cutting-edge effects are secondary to a good story, but here he shows us that he is very hypocritical of what he said because honestly, that's all this film is really achievable for. Overall, this was a bumpy start to a rocky Star Wars franchise."
"Aug 19, 2016",1,"With Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi coming out in a few months, I took it upon myself to go through all of the Star Wars canon material that Disney deems critical to the story in chronological order. This means all of the comics, books, movies, television shows, and video games which Disney has stated is the canon of Star Wars. This begins with the Darth Maul 2017 comic and then moves on to this film. I've seen this film before, many times in fact, I've watched all of the Star Wars movies (minus the animated Clones Wars films) many times over. But time and time again, this one never fails to disappoint me. It is, in my opinion, the worst film of the three prequels which have garnered hate from fans for years now. The acting is stale, save a few performances like Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) and Obi-wan (Ewan McGregor). The performance of Keira Knightley as a decoy for Padme Amidala (whom we see in that role for most of the film) is of particular importance to me as she personifies the acting issues in my opinion. Her character has no emotion anywhere whatsoever. She is blank faced, never smiles, never even shudders her vocals a bit. It is as if she, and many other actors in this film, are reading the script out loud for the first time. This doesn't even touch upon Jar Jar Binks which is a whole travesty on its own. the only saving graces this film has is the music, Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul. Honestly, I wouldn't even put Darth Maul on the list of positives as he has, at most, 3 lines in the entire film. The only claim to fame Maul has is his fight with Qui-Gon, his sinister appearance, and his unique light saber. Past that, he has no personality or character at all. This is truly a shame since I read the 2017 Darth Maul comic just before watch this. the comic for Darth Maul gives so much more depth and context to the character that otherwise has no character at all. It's a shame it took 18 years for Maul to gain a comic of this caliber. This part of the Star Wars saga will undoubtedly go down as my choice for worst Star Wars film and it gets worse every time I trudge through it. I only hope my slightly higher opinion of Attack of the Clones (emphasis on ""slightly"") does not sour more, for I do not know if I can handle suffering through another Star Wars film of this magnitude."

"Aug 16, 2016",3,"Is this the Star Wars movie that kills the beloved franchise with its odd CGI and odd writing? Well, I would say not completely. I found this to be an exhilarating adventure, not on the same level as the original trilogy, but for what it is."

"Aug 13, 2016",2.5,"This is not a movie. it is 2 hours of soulless talking heads delivering poorly written, uninteresting exposition. The only people in this movie with any modicum of a personality are qui gon, Anakin, and jar jar. qui gon is only semi interesting because Liam neeson is such an amazing actor, as well as the intriguing but tragically underdeveloped theme of his disagreements with the Jedi council. Anakin only has a personality because it's a poor child actor doing the best he can with the terrible direction and script he was given. we don't even need to talk about jar jar. when stuff finally does happen it is entertaining, although the excitement is probably amplified due to the previous 2 hours being filled with pure boredom. I give this a semi pass because I'm a star wars fanboy and I do have fun watching this ironically. but if I'm being objective, it's a broken film "
"Aug 13, 2016",1,Madness CSI shows the saga in the worst way possible.

"Aug 07, 2016",2,"Darth Maul is excellent, so is Obi Wan and Qui Gon however Young Anakin and the rest make for a very bad film. The score however is excellent and worth a listen, a lot better then this film deserves."
"Aug 07, 2016",2.5,Effects and music stands out pretty well but the movie itself is a backstory you don't need to watch.
"Aug 06, 2016",3,"well i loved star wars when i was a kid and i still do now back when i was ten it just mattered that there was action and fast paced lightsaber combat i saw the previous star wars and thought it was the main problem looking back there so perfect thats actually still my main complaint with the original series.
the phantom menace not being underwhelming after watching the movie several there are many scenes that get boring.
 the dialogue is horrible but not the worst of the series.
the acting is okay (second best of the series in almost every area including acting )
they fill scenes with annoying way too long political scenes though they are required are too drawn out, if they informed more about the jedi past and history
that also goes into my next topic and that the story that they lied down needed a movie with a bad story unless they changed the clone wars to uncanon than this needed to be bad.
the good things consist of great music with great sound effects in the music like a mystical chime and that with the effects mix those in and you get great atmosphere though it weaken's as the movie goes on and the designs of the city's and props planets ect. were great.
i do with that they incorporated more of the council doings and the jedi training in the movie problem solved overall barley fresh.this time."

"Aug 04, 2016",2.5,"Visually it's amazing, and you can sense the potential that this movie had to be something great. But in the end, this film really is a letdown. Too much exposition, underdeveloped characters (which most end up being bad), and a very uninteresting story. However, the sense of wonder and exploration is still there, and the action sequences are such an amazing improvement over the previous films. As a whole, it's a very average experience. What's good about the film is very good, but what's bad about it is also very bad."

"Jul 25, 2016",2,"Bad acting,horrible sidekick *cough* *cough* jar jar *cough*,dissposable CGI armies,awkard acting and really bad pacing issues make The Phantom Menace a mess of CGI lasers"
"Jul 23, 2016",2.5,pretty dull and boring. PLUS JAR JAR! The only saving grace in this is a cool lightsaber duel. the worst one in the franchise by far.
"Jul 21, 2016",5,Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace what is a good start from the get-go I'm showing the beginning how it all started before.  Anakin Skywalker became a friend of Obi-Wan Kenobi and then years later Falling Into Darkness and that's a falling-out of Anakin Skywalker was revealed in Star Wars Attack of the Clone Wars what was the middle of telling the backstory of the beginning not really really started how you became friends and out of hatred what a good way to start the beginning of Star Wars.      I'm giving this movie A 10.1
"Jul 20, 2016",5,"A great movie, starts off the Star Wars story great, darth maul one of the best villains In Star Wars makes an entrance, the scenery is amazing and the story is creative"
"Jul 19, 2016",3.5,"I don't hate it with the fiery passion that the internet tells me I should, nor does Jar Jar Binks make me wince as much as everyone else. Let's remember, this movie gave us A) John Williams' epic ""Duel of the Fates"" score and B) Darth Maul. It's not a great movie, but I liked it as a kid, which is who the audience was, which means they succeeded in my opinion."
"Jul 19, 2016",1,"This movie was so bad people were in denial for years stupid plot points, wooden acting, shit characters (Anakin,Jar jar) and stupid coincidences that are so cringeworthy and of course all the boring acting the only reason i give it a star is because Darth Maul vs Obi wan and Qui gon is great."
"Jul 18, 2016",1.5,DARTH MAUL and qui gon  jinn  is the only reason I gave this what I did
"Jul 17, 2016",3.5,It's not great but it definitely gets a lot more hate than it deserves.
"Jul 16, 2016",4.5,"I am a fan of Star Wars in general. I especially like this one because little Anakin Skywalker is one of my favorite characters. He's an awesome and adorable kid. Too bad he has to grow up to become the evil Darth Vader!

There is a lot going on in this, good action and interesting characters.
I think that Qui-Gonn Jinn's having Anakin pod race was highly unethical. It was central to the storyline, but not right to me. I don't believe for a second that a powerful Jedi just couldn't find another way. Jinn apparently lacked imagination (and that is not Liam Neeson's fault). I don't have to agree with everything in a Star Wars movie to find it entertaining. 

To see the beginnings of the mysterious dark character Darth Vader was interesting, along with the future evil Emperor when he was a mere Senator, Syth Lord in disguise.

A lot of characters vital to the continued story are introduced and developed. There is so much happening all over the place, and yet the storyline is coherent and ties together. 

Darth Maul is a visually appealing adversary, with a striking red and black head and some kick ass martial arts moves. The final battle scenes were climactic and exciting. The Gungens vs droids battle had some funny moments. The loss of Qui-Gon Jinn and his replacement by his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi was tragically memorable.

Although some were annoyed by Jar Jar Binx, I thought he was kind of lovable and funny. Perhaps just a bit too much of his antics, but it's hard to get every detail absolutely perfect. There was a lot of creativity in the development of characters, costumes, and I particularly liked the watery underworld on the planet Naboo, from the mysterious Gungen city to the giant seamonsters in the core ocean. 

And who can forget the lovely Queen Amidala of Naboo and her handmaiden decoy. Elected ruler for life? Hmmmm, I wonder how THAT works!"
"Jul 15, 2016",3,"Augh. Just Augh. Albeit better than AotC, this is pretty bad. Shaky writing horrible writing, and Too much JarJar."
"Jul 15, 2016",3,"The only positives I can give this movie is Ewan Mcgegor as Obi Wan and the light saber battle between Obi Wan, Qui Gon and Darth Maul, in my opinion Darth Maul should of been the Darth Vader of the prequels, disappointing tbh"

Loved duel of fates scene still love that battle song 

I love more back story on Jedi and beginnings of all but still like this one"
"Jul 09, 2016",3,"The Phantom Menace is the origin story of Anakin Skywalker. Even though the movie has a terrific antagonist in Darth Maul, other characters like Jar Jar Binks and Anakin weigh the film down. I like the lightsaber duel and the space battle, but other parts of this movie just aren't very good. There are way to many exposition scenes and the dialogue in this film is often times boring. Overall its pretty bad for Star Wars, but is an average movie for its genre."
"Jul 09, 2016",2.5,"It has its good and bad, but The Phantom Menace is truly wasted potential, coming off of the original Star Wars trilogy, there are stale characters all throughout this movie."
"Jul 07, 2016",4,An entertaining way to start off the Star Wars Saga.
"Jul 05, 2016",1.5,"A huge misfire from George Lucas that really is the worst of the Star Wars movies that have been made to date (well except that dreadful thing about the Ewoks). The clamour for Lucas to give us a series of prequels for the original, much loved movies made it inevitable that some day, they would be made. Quite how he got it so badly wrong is hard to credit. So let's start with some positives. The film maintains much of the feel of the originals with a good John Williams score playing behind space battles and sweeping vistas. There are some exotic locations and a new clutch of bizarre looking creatures. The film looks beautiful and hangs onto that classic movie serial feel so beloved by Lucas. However, the turgid plot about trade embargoes and taxation is, frankly, dull. There's simply not enough action. The chief baddie, Darth Maul, whilst an impressive character, is barely in it and the acting is, on the whole, stilted and forced especially when it comes to the dreadful Jake Lloyd who confirms every prejudice about child actors. Despite the huge advances made in special effects since Return of the Jedi had been made, there are aspects of The Phantom Menace that simply do not work. Yoda, who had been a charming, character-filled creation up to this point is now a squinty-eyed sock monkey that is laughably realised and not a patch on the version seen in The Empire Strikes Back. The character of Jar Jar Binks, a kind of bipedal frog, is as unconvincing as he is irritating. A sort of amphibious Mr. Bean, he is hugely irritating and annoying and thankfully, makes only fleeting appearances in subsequent movies. I can't think how the script, with its clunky dialogue and pseudoscientific gobbledygook made it to the screen without substantial rewrites and I really can't fathom what audience the movie was being pitched at, being incomprehensible to children and too childish for adults. The Phantom Menace is an unremarkable first chapter in one of the most iconic movie franchises and was always going to make mega-bucks due to the legacy of the saga. It is a shame it is quite so lame and thankfully, things did improve from this point on."

"Jun 22, 2016",2,"Darth Maul, double bladed lightsaber, what could go wrong with this film?! Oh yeah, comic relief Jar Jar Binks and a Tatooine pod race that went about 7-10 minutes too long. It is unfortunate that they wasted arguably the 2nd best villain of the entire franchise in the first abysmal film. About 3 minutes into Jar Jar Binks' screen time you know that the script has a long way to go to dig itself out of that hole."
"Jun 21, 2016",1,"George Lucas begins his prequel trilogy in truly disappointing fashion with Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace, assaulting the viewer with a stampede of horrible writing, hilariously bad acting, annoying characters, and a vomit-inducing overabundance of computer generated effects that don't hold up."

"May 22, 2016",2,"As viewers may be excited to look at the origins of the Skywalker family, the phantom menace is a film simply with no enlightenment for a prequel and makes a failed attempt to add comedy with Jar-Jar to the Star Wars saga."
"May 22, 2016",2,"Watched this movie twice. Once to watch a Star Wars movie, then again to see if what I watched was a Star Wars movie."
"May 21, 2016",0.5,"This movie is the worst of the pre-quells. I feel bad for the people who spent money in the theater for this piece of crap. This movie had the potential to be good, but everything went wrong. It seems that George Lucas made the first draft of the script and didn't change anything afterward. Because of this horrible script, the movie has not only bad acting, but many confusing plot elements. Like who is the main character? Its not the Jedi since they are only on a mission, it's not the queen since she really doesn't do much, and even if you say it's Anikan, everything is out of his control. The entire end fight is not in his control, he did it by accident. But since this is a movie, the sad truth is that it will never go away. Not to mention all of the merchandise that won't go away."
"May 21, 2016",2,"Star Wars is an undisputed sci-fi classic and when the announcement of a prequel trilogy came over twenty years ago, the anticipation was enormous. When the new series of films finally arrived in 1999 with The Phantom Menace, fans were left disappointed by George Lucas's new vision for his grand space opera. With the release of ""The Force Awakens"" bearing down on us, I think it's time I shared my own thoughts on every main entry in the Star Wars saga, beginning with Episode I.

The Phantom Menace kicks off the prequel trilogy with the invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation and their army of battle droids, who aim to capture Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) and force her to sign a treaty over a trade dispute. In the midst of this political scuffle, two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) must uncover the true force behind the invasion, while also coming to terms with the discovery of a young boy remarkably gifted with powers of the force named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). Judging by the plot summary I have just given, you may be left scratching your head at the themes the film homes in on. That's because The Phantom Menace doesn't do a very good job of drawing the viewer into its story and it continues to commit this critical mistake across much of the running time. Episode I is a plodding exercise in frustration when compared with the original films, where just about everything that happened was interesting and relevant to the plot. Aside from a few scant moments of excitement, the ultimate issue with Episode I is that it's dull; when the action heats up at the end of the film, I really get into it but almost everything else is all talk and no engagement. I can see what they were trying to go for here; they wanted to capture the more civilised age of the republic, to show how careful and politicised everything was before the Empire's big takeover. But instead of immersing us in the varied and expansive worlds that are introduced with the modern filmmaking technology, the plot instead repels and jars the audience with endless chatter and political rhetoric which doesn't tell us anything about the characters, factions or lore that were hinted at in the original trilogy.

The characters of The Phantom Menace are sadly just as boring as the plot; to this day, I'm not too sure what kind of filmmaking mind-set caused an almost complete elimination of any emotion or acting substance, but it's here to stay for this movie. Qui-Gon is a blank slate, never changing his emotions in any way over the course of the film, Jake Lloyd's acting is horribly wooden and the same goes for Queen Amidala, making the little chemistry they have together almost entirely useless. The Jedi Council is also very disappointing, a basic set of robed figures that do little more than sit around in a room for most of the film. And then there's Jar Jar; what was once a serious point of contention for racial stereotyping and overzealous child marketing is now merely a serious annoyance that endlessly sticks out like the sore thumb he is. Even the characters in the film seem annoyed by his presence, but try as they might to weed him off, he just doesn't go away. While most of the characters fail, there are a couple that redeem the cast; Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan has a light sense of charisma which the other actors fail to bring to their roles. Darth Maul however is by far the best aspect of the entire film. What is it that makes him a solid villain? From you moment we first see him, you can tell that he means business; he has a very intimidating and sinister image and this is backed up by his ferocity in battle. Ray Parks gives a brilliant physical performance filled with dazzling stunt work and to top it all off, he is a man of few words and as a result, his presence is never diminished by awkward dialogue.

The computer generated imagery used in the Star Wars prequels have long been a topic of criticism and in Episode I, they definitely show their age in certain areas. The most notable of these are characters such as Watto, the Gungan leader Boss Nass and the battle droids; when they're right up in front of the camera, looking like a video game cut-scene, it's obvious that they aren't actually there and this really hurts the film's believability. Despite this issue, when the computer effects are kept at a distance, I feel that they don't get in the way nearly as much. What the special effects do best though is introduce us to countless new worlds, not to mention give off a tremendous sense of scale. From the expansive landscape of the Naboo capital to the vast metropolis of Coruscant, the film does work in this regard to draw the viewer into its universe. In addition, the film also boasts some brilliant cinematography, editing and music. Duel of the fates by John Williams is an astounding compliment to the final lightsaber battle, while the action itself is fluid and organised, with many long shots of the environments placed alongside panning and medium shots of the characters. It's a well-produced film that ends up being dragged down by its weak plot and underwhelming characterisation.

It's endlessly debated among the fans, but in my eyes, The Phantom Menace remains the weakest entry of the entire saga; the plot is slow and tedious, the characters are mostly flat and by the time the film finally does get interesting in the third act, you're left wishing that the film made more of an effort to keep you invested. A few good performances alongside some well thought out production values just barely keep it from being wholly unwatchable."

It may be cheesy and annoying at some points, but few scenes are any more ridiculous when you really think of the premise of the films. That being said many of the actors seem genuinely confused speaking their lines and way too much time is spent on the pod racing scene."

"May 05, 2016",2.5,"If it was screening in 1990 perhaps I would think it as one of the best sci-fi movie, but it is not. The storyline, the script are somehow slow and boring, and its visual effect and world concept is outdated by today's standard."
"May 05, 2016",3,Darth Maul is excellent in the movie and I wish would have survived the lightsaber duel. The diretor of the prequels was in a different place than origlally made out to be based on the first 3 movies.
"May 05, 2016",4,"On this special day of Ascension, a public holiday in Norway celebrating Jesus Christ´s ascension to heaven, I opened by Star Wars Blu Ray collection and embarked on my 7 part interstellar journey. Optimum in enjoying this legendary space film franchise is a little research before watching the film. This helps in staying with the plot and not to get lost with the many strange looking characters. Thanks to an excellent synopsis by wikipedia, I shut myself up in my private viewing room. With a 4k TV, high definition blu-ray discs, and  a DTH sound system, it was a fantastic experience. Full marks to Liam Neeson and Ewen McGregor as highly skilled Jedi Knights. To make it realistic, George Lucas gave us Ja Ja Binks and his tribe of green 60s hippies amphibians. Many find them irritating but so it is so in our real world, we face irritating oddballs constantly in our daily lives. Before watching SW2 Attack of the Clones, I´m reading George Lucas screenplays  first, Seeing Jabba the Hutt giant toad and his tentacle face companion brought Deja Vu for me."
"May 02, 2016",2,"Tonally jarring, annoying slapstick humor, Jar Jar, Muppet Baby Darth Vader, ruining the Force with midichlorians, flat characters, little narrative drive, cartoony CGI. The pod race sequence is the only scene that could possibly hold a candle to the original trilogy, but even that scene is cartoonish, a little confusing and punctuated by lazy humor."
"Apr 30, 2016",2.5,"By far the weakest of all the Star Wars movies, with a laughable narrative and extremely poor characterisation (in turn producing one of the worst characters in film history, Jar Jar Binks) Phantom Menace uses vibrant special effects in replacement for a decent plot.
Verdict: C"

"Mar 21, 2016",4,"While it's not as good as the films that came before it (yet are somehow after it), it is still a pleasure to watch. I am in the minority with this, I know, but I don't find Jar Jar annoying, I don't think the acting is terrible, and I don't think it deserves all the hate. The reason the score is not higher is because of the climax constantly switching between three fronts. Besides that, it serves as a great start to the six Star Wars movies."

"Mar 18, 2016",3,"The weak first episode (and 4th film) in the Star Wars saga.  Best known for its introduction to the terrible character Jar Jar Binks, this film is poorly acted, too complicated and disjointed.  Jar Jar is supposed to be the comic relief, but all his jokes are not funny, and often do not suit the serious tone of the scene.

This is the worst of all 7 Star Wars films.  Even Yoda's costume looks horrible.  What was George Lucas thinking?"

"Mar 10, 2016",2,"A very slow paced, nothing is truly happening movie, though It does have a few very well done sequences. At the end of the day, this is the least important film in the Star Wars series."
"Mar 09, 2016",1,"A frequent 'praise' I hear of this film is that if it wasn't a Star Wars movie it would just be a semi-decent science fiction movie. I'd actually say that being part of an established film series is the only thing saving it from being zero stars. Ignoring what it did to the story, it is a poor narrative in every sense of the word. There is no main character, everyone just sort of hangs out there while nothing interesting happens. That brings me to a different point, nothing happens. There's no plot. I've watched this movie several times, I still have no idea what the story is. They go on a spaceship, they go to a computer generated set, they bounce around for a while. If your movie isn't interesting enough to have me remember anything past character names, it was a poor effort. The characters in this have no personality. It's such a let down when you imagine how cool it must be when Anakin and Obi Wan met, then they are finally introduced by some mutual friends or whatever and they just shake hands. Make them do something interesting! Add drama or tension! Do anything that piques my interest movie! When Qui Gon dies, I am not invested in him. If a movie character dies, I should feel something from it.And I will say this a million times over, Darth Maul was the most underused villain in the history of cinema. You can barely even call him a villain, all he does that's evil is participate as the opposing side during the climax of the film. He's such an interesting concept for a character. A ruthless, calculating killer hiding in the shadows to rip apart his prey. But instead, he was wasted. Overall, poor."
"Mar 09, 2016",4,"The Phantom Menace is still an exciting, unique addition to the Star Wars saga."
"Mar 07, 2016",3,"TPM uses far more practical effects than people give it credit for and also sets the groundwork for a new era in the Star Wars universe. However, the acting suffers from poor writing and direction, and much of the CGI is inexcusable. It works as a Star Wars film, just not as a film.

"Mar 05, 2016",0.5,THE. WORST. MOVIE. EVER (Besides Batman and Robin). Enough said.
"Mar 05, 2016",1,"Burdened with too many characters, none of which are developed well enough for the audience to thoroughly know much like with the original trio Luke, Leia and Han, as well as lazy storytelling relying on special effects, unique-looking aliens, robots and planets that all also aren't developed well enough due to George Lucas' decision to rush everything rather than taking things slow and steady as back in NEW HOPE and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, in addition to the very annoying and yap-yapping Jar Jar Binks, the Phantom Menace may be the worst prequel/sequel/remake ever made to any movie series (unfortunately having to be the once superior Star Wars) and one of the worst things any filmmaker has done to his own movie series."
"Mar 04, 2016",1,"Watching this film is like filling out College applications. You know it's going to suck, but you've must do it in order to get to the next level."
"Mar 03, 2016",3,"As a child of the nineties, 'The Phantom Menace' was my first venture into George Lucas's globally revered 'Star Wars' universe, and what a remarkable discovery it was. On second thoughts, the word 'remarkable' doesn't do justice to my experience, because love it or hate it, 'The Phantom Menace' changed by whole world forever. As the setup of a new trilogy of movies that would explore the origins of the franchise's original (and most famous) villain, Darth Vader, 'Episode I' has its fair share of problems. Make no mistake, this is a heavily flawed movie, but I believe that those who feel compelled to rip it to shreds and accuse it of being inferior to the originals may have missed the point entirely. The movie's purpose was not to live up to the high standards of the original trilogy, which realistically speaking, it never had a chance of doing, but rather to introduce a brand new generation of viewers (like myself) into to the wonders of 'Star Wars.' It's a long shot from perfection, but despite some less than compelling execution, 'The Phantom Menace' still succeeds in its goals, and remains of my favourite childhood movies of all time. 

One of the most regretful aspects of the movie was its inability to match fan expectations. Many fans were clamoring for another masterpiece of the likes of 'A New Hope' or 'The Empire Strikes Back', but that was never George Lucas's intention. By his own admission, Lucas is neither very good at writing or directing, and in the original trilogy, had the smarts to hire professional collaborators to help bring his visions to life for the second and third installments. If there's one major issue at the centre of 'The Phantom Menace', it was Lucas's over ambition. And yet, while I may criticise it here, I also find it admirable. Here is a man with a creative vision, and regardless of what others may think, has the willingness and the patience (and the money!) to bring it to life the way he always meant it to. The finished product was always going to be a flawed one, so if this review sounds slightly apologetic, it's probably because I can understand why it failed in so many areas. But with a movie like this, there's no use in focusing on the negatives. This is a movie that is, by definition, inferior to the original 'Star Wars', but still admirable in its own right. The first line of Roger Ebert's review for 'The Phantom Menace' is still an inspiration to me: 'If it were the first 'Star Wars' movie, 'The Phantom Menace' would be hailed as a visionary breakthrough.' Ebert's fascination and positivity towards the 'Star Wars' movies matches my own, and it's through his words that I felt compelled to explore the more positive aspects of the movie in my review. In an age of cynicism, let's not forget to celebrate the good that comes from movies, even if they're as flawed as 'The Phantom Menace.' 

If you're the kind of cinemagoer who prefers to obsess over story and character, then you're inevitably not going to get a positive experience out of 'The Phantom Menace.' But if you're like me, and are able to forgive some less than compelling plotting and characterisation and appreciate the fantastical escapist nature of the film, then there's plenty to enjoy here. It's a shame that the characters introduced here aren't as iconic or memorable as those we came to know in the original trilogy. There's no lovable rogue like Han Solo or relatable protagonist like Luke Skywalker, and the closest thing we get to Chewbacca is a digitally created character called Jar Jar Binks, a comedic character who ends up being more of an irritation than an amusement, but I'm not going to ferociously criticise the movie just because the characters are a bit bland. 

The acting talents of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are unforgivably wasted, however, particularly in the case of the latter. Neeson plays Qui-Gon Jinn, the wise mentor figure occupied by Sir Alec Guinness in the original trilogy, but we never learn anything about Qui-Gon's life or backstory, and more concerning, he appears to be missing a personality. Lucas seems to insist that emotionless stoicism be the default setting for the Jedi, but it doesn't make for very compelling screen presences. Similarly, McGregor, who plays the younger version of Guinness's Obi-Wan Kenobi, is unjustifiably back seated throughout the picture, and is occasionally permitted to utter bland lines of dialogue to remind audiences that he hasn't completely vanished. I feel Mr. Lucas made a vital mistake in this area; ideally, the movie should have focused on Obi-Wan, a character whom we've already been introduced to and would like to know more about, and we would gradually watch him grow and develop into the more mature and wiser Alec Guinness type we first met in 'A New Hope' over the course of the three movies. Obi-Wan's lack of screen presence was a wasted opportunity, especially when considering the potential that McGregor had in the role, and what's worse is that we never witness the earliest days of the relationship between Obi-Wan and the adolescent Anakin Skywalker, i.e. the whole purpose of the prequel trilogy. 

On the subject of Anakin, Jake Lloyd (who portrays the ten-year-old version of Darth Vader) doesn't actually appear until approximately halfway through the movie, and isn't treated with the expected seriousness as much as a convenient device to help advance the plot. Much like his son-to-be, Luke Skywalker, Anakin was raised in poverty on the desert planet of Tatooine, but lacks the relatable nature of his offspring, and Lucas has deliberately gone out of his way to highlight Anakin's alleged importance in the greater narrative. We're constantly reminded that Anakin is the 'chosen one', one of the oldest clichés in fantasy storytelling, and that it's Anakin's destiny to 'bring balance to the Force', whatever that's supposed to mean. Vader is undoubtedly a very important part of Star Wars lore, and undoubtedly the most famous (or infamous) screen antagonists of all time, but Anakin is simultaneously overcooked and underdeveloped. We're told of Anakin's great destiny and immense importance, but in terms of fleshing out the character, there's nothing here. Lucas doesn't seem as interested in developing his characters as reminding us of why they're important, and it's a shame the franchise's creator doesn't take as much interest in his own characters as the fans. The closest we get to actual development is Anakin's infatuation with Padme (Natalie Portman), a fourteen-year-old handmaiden to Queen Amidala who's sole purpose in the movie can be traced to the love story that will flourish in the subsequent two installments. 

While it may fail on the narrative front, 'The Phantom Menace' is nothing short of a triumph when it comes to world building and pure fantastical escapism. Until now, the only version of the Star Wars galaxy we've witnessed is that ruled by the dreaded Empire. Now we find ourselves thrust back in time, to around thirty years before the Empire casts its bleak shadow across the countless star systems, and all involved have done an exceptional job of fleshing out this treasured universe in a way never seen before. Just like the original movie, 'The Phantom Menace' was a milestone in demonstrating the possibilities generated by digital effects, and proved once again that anything that could be imagined could now be realised. These days, we take such astonishing computerised creations for granted, but back in '99, these kinds of visual effects were revolutionary, and it's a shame we can no longer appreciate or be as awestruck by them as we once were. 

Equally stunning is John Williams' soundtrack, who returns to compose the fourth entry in the saga following his timeless work on the original trilogy, to provide one of the most groundbreaking orchestral soundtracks of all time. 'Duel of the Fates', which plays during the climactic lightsaber battle between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul will likely go down in history as one of the most iconic pieces of 'battle music' ever to grace cinema, and 'Anakin's Theme' is similarly beautiful in a much gentler and more symphonic way, even offering slight hints of Vader's theme, a subtle piece of musical foreshadowing that is unlikely to be missed by keen eared fans. 

As aforementioned, 'The Phantom Menace' may be a failure on a narrative level, and its inability to connect to me on an emotional level as well as Lucas's poor attempts at character depth are what really let this installment down. While it's unlikely that you'll remember any of the characters or the dialogue once the credits finish rolling, the waterfalls of Naboo and the towering skyscrapers of Coruscant are far more likely to remain in your mind's eye, and if nothing else, 'Episode I' does a decent job of reintroducing the Star Wars universe to a new generation of fans. As many long-term fans have already cited, 'The Phantom Menace' is best viewed as an extended prologue to the subsequent installments, and is one I would recommend mainly as a gateway movie for younger audiences wishing to become invested in the Star Wars story for the first time. It's mostly spectacle over substance, but the impressive world building, technical achievements (by 1999 standards, anyway) and escapist nature of the film all make the official 'first' episode in the Star Wars saga one worth investigating, even if it pales in comparison to the original three pictures."
"Mar 02, 2016",5,"On discovering George Lucas' ring cycle for the six SW films and who the Phantom Menace actually is (JJ Binks I'm looking at you!) I have to up my rating. An essential part of GW's 12hour long 'ring cycle' well worth re-visiting!
And after the release of Disney's hacked attempt at a left wing propaganda film dressed in SW's clothing (TLJ) and their remake of Ep4, I had to come back and up the rating again. This film gets better and better each time I watch it. What most people who deride this film don't seem to realise is that this is not meant to be the equivalent of Ep 4, but is in fact a mirror of Ep 6. And Jar Jar, he is the phantom menace. Annoying yes, but that is the very intention. He's not comic relief but the hidden dark side equivalent of Yoda and was meant to be revealed in Ep2. What wonders what could have been if GL had followed through in the big reveal in Ep2."
"Feb 29, 2016",4,a it of slow pacing and definitely see flaws but overall actually not a bad movie that has done so much for the star wars franchise.
"Feb 28, 2016",4.5,"The movie overall isn't amazing, but there were enough bright spots to make me deeply enjoy the film. It doesn't hurt that Qui-Gon and Darth Maul are two of my favourite characters of the whole series."
"Feb 27, 2016",4,"Ok so the excitement for this movie in 1999 was insane, and while yes it's not the STAR WARS movie we all expected. It's actually not a bad movie at all, and not a bad way to introduce all these characters. Besides JAR JAR Binks there was very little I hated in this movie. I liked how it sets up the following movies with Anakin now being left to train with Obi Wan, and how our heroes are left not knowing who the Sith are, and how they survived. Senator Palpatine really steals this movie, and ultimately this trilogy is his trilogy as he's the mastermind behind the entire uprise of the Empire.

Overall George Lucas wrote a great storyline which was rich with elements which felt like STAR WARS.. Sadly enough his directing was so rusty that he forgot to make sure his story didn't include things which were down right insulting to STAR WARS fans.

Jar Jar is insulting in many ways... Since Lucas liked to edit his OT why can't he edit Jar Jar in the Prequels? First I'd remove the scene where he steps on poo, and says ""ohh icky icky poo.""  I mean seriously!? But I remember watching this movie on opening night twice, and loving it. It was only after I fully digested what I had seen that I was able to point out what I didn't like. But with that said there was a lot more that I liked in the movie that I didn't.

The cast was fantastic (except Ahmed Best as Jar Jar) I even liked Jake Lloyd as young Anakin... I never understood why that kid was bullied so much that it ruined his life. All in all the movie sets up the prequel trilogy in a very satisfactory way.

Yes this movie is nowhere near as good as any of the originals! Not close by a mile!! But it serves well as a catalyst for the rest of the saga."

"Feb 23, 2016",5,"1977's Star Wars introduced the world to a galaxy far far away, where viewers first met the now iconic characters of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Darth Vader. This original trilogy managed to gather a cult like following and forever change the way the world looks at movies. Now, 1999's Star Wars: The Phantom Menace takes us back in time to offer some insight on the origin of these characters. Right from the beginning, this movie has some huge shoes to fill, but instead of mimicking the exact style of the old movies, the movie boldly steps away and establishes a world of beauty and wonder, which beautifully compliments the darker nature of the original trilogy.
Right as the film starts, we meet our new protagonists, Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), as they attempt to settle a dispute with the Trade Federation, who has plans to take over the planet of Naboo. Right off the bat, we are able to see the pride and sense of duty of the old Jedi Knights that was repeatedly touched on and looked up to in the original trilogy. The constant sense of nobility and moral virtue that comes with these characters lends itself to the wonder of the movie, as it helps to create characters which can be looked up to and trusted for their decisions. 
 After failing to defuse the situation, the two Jedi Knights head to Naboo to warn Queen Amadala, and along the way they meet their new friend Jar Jar Binks. Eventually they decide it would be safest to leave the planet, and so begins their journey to take the Queen to the Galactic Senate to seek assistance. Through stunning visuals of journeys to new underwater cities and fast paced pod races, those who watch this movie are able to see a whole new side to the Star Wars galaxy. While the original trilogy was able to successfully show the galaxy in wartime with the constant threat of the evil Empire showing up, the visual effects in Episode One are able to emphasize that this is the galaxy before the dark cloud of the Empire hung over every planet. This movie does a great job of juxtaposing the fast paced and often high pressure situations that were found in the later movies with much more lighthearted adventures and broad stunning scenes that could have only been dreamed about in 1977.  
	To address the importance and the brilliance of the soundtrack for the Star Wars series, find someone who has never seen Star Wars, and play for them the Star Wars Main Title, or perhaps the Imperial March, and they will recognize both. The original trilogy was filled to the brim with memorable and encompassing music that made John Williams famous. For the Phantom Menace, Williams creates a score that is diverse in style, matching the accompanying scenes perfectly. Though each individual part is wonderful on its own, it isn't until the entire score is looked at as a whole that it really becomes exceptional. Having achieved such success previously, it would have been easy to interweave the old themes, but instead Williams is able to incorporate his most notable elements, such as his distinct usage of high brass and a variety of percussive features, in a way that is different, yet is still able to provide a wave of nostalgia and create a world of its own.
Though one of the most controversial topics related to the Star Wars franchise is the changes that were made post release, it brings up the real purpose of this movie. The prequels are able to elaborate on and demonstrate the magic and wonder of this galaxy in ways that the original trilogy never could, due to both the story and setting, as well as lack of movie technology. Full of beautifully created landscapes, this movie shows not only the majesty of this fictional universe, but also the potential for the future of all movies."
"Feb 20, 2016",5,"Boasting some thrilling action sequences, breathtaking saber choreography, and a story that makes perfect sense when put into context with the rest of the Star Wars movies, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi, adventure film."
"Feb 19, 2016",3.5,"this movie is not terrible there is plenty I like about this film it maybe my least favorite in the franchise but I liked the battle scenes near the end there was gun duels space duels my favorite was the lightsaber duel plus duel of the fates playing, jar jar binks I don't mind anyways 3 1/2 stars 75%"
"Feb 15, 2016",2,"I think after many re-watches, much soul searching and deep deep thought. I have settled on a Two star rating for Episode 1.
It is utterly terrible on so many levels, and manages to cast actors I like a great deal (McGregor, Neeson, and Portman), and create characters I could not care less about. Jar Jar was a dreadful misstep, as was the idea of focusing on a precocious eight year old who can't act. The Pod Race is merely a Turbo Terrific short of a Wacky Racers episode, and the best thing in the whole movie (Darth Maul) is underused and dispatched ignominiously as a one shot villain. The saber duel is great in places, but Lucas constantly interrupts it with 'Yipee' and 'Meesa no have a boomba' moments of shitness.
HOWEVER
It is the one and only time the prequels had some genuine production design flair, and it benefits from not everything being computer generated.
It was a dreadful disappointment at the time, and still is. It isn't the worst of the prequels though, so it's a two, as I need room to go DOWN."

Also, who is the Phantom Menace, and what does he/she/it have to do with this movie?"
"Feb 05, 2016",1,"Perhaps it is because of my self-entitled attitude which comes with being a millennial that makes me feel as through I've been wounded more than Qui-Gon Jinn at this very moment. I just sat through Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace for the first time in close to two years and I find myself shocked and chagrinned to discover that so many of the things I used to love as a young child about this film are hopelessly derivative and cliche.

Phantom Menace was the first Star Wars film I ever saw in spring of 2001. I was just getting into movies at the time and the only real reason I saw it first was because it was on one night and one of my parents taped it (oh god, yes, 90s nostalgia!) for me to watch the next day as it's airing time impeded with my 8:00 bedtime. I watched the film the next day and thought it was the finest thing I had ever lain my young eyes on but now the last burnt vestige of withheld sympathy has finally gone up in flames and I honestly feel like the protagonist in a Smiths song minus Manchester or a specific failed relationship.

The tragedy here begins and ends with how aimlessly the film's important scenes are executed. Where George struck gold in A New Hope, Phantom is a film with hit and miss acting, several characters whose necessary presences further corrode said acting, and a storyline which jumps the fence in terms of speed (slow trade talk, oh wait here's a podrace sequence!, midi chlorian rant, oh wait holy toledo it's Darth Maul!), etc. etc. and I can't help but feel betrayed by a film I put my trust in. Where the Original Trilogy had exciting storylines and whose overall ethos redefined science fiction, Phantom kicks off the Prequel trilogy like a slow-witted, self-important university frat-dweller who has no idea how hard their previous generation worked to be successful. It features a cast of actors who for some parts are wonderfully talented people, but whose performances here are watered-down and harpooned by the dialogue and the inability of the film's creative masterminds to let them do their job properly. And here I rest my point; the film stars well-established actors like Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, and even more British and Scottish theatre-trained actors like Terence Stamp as ineffective Chancellor Valorum and of course Ian McDiarmid as the Palpatine we all love and hate. All strong proponents which could easily bolster the film's potential and truly make the first chronological star wars film (as of 2016) amazing and they can't because the lack of lively and meaningful dialogue suffocates them right in their tracks.

But the truly optimistic fans (god bless their hearts for theirs are stronger and more loving than mine) will argue that Phantom Menace indeed has a few strong points; namely the Pod Race sequence and the juiced-up lightsaber duels which help begin to paint a picture of what the Jedi Order were like before their Downfall. To both of these points, I will partially agree and partially disagree; the Pod Race was indeed exciting - for the first lap after which the entire novelty wore off as the Anakin v Sebulba rivalry took it's sweet time resolving itself. As for  the lightsaber duels, I will admit that the Duel of the Fates was the first real lightsaber duels I saw (it was 2001, guys) where I didn't feel as if the Jedi were just slacking off or just horribly trained. However, Qui-Gon's performance in said duels are bordering on plot holes in my view; he's a Jedi Master who trained Obi-Wan Kenobi and neutralized his first apprentice after he turned to the Dark Side and yet he's that winded after a 45-second duel with Darth Maul... Are you kidding me!?? Is this some sort of inside easter egg joke that I just never got or was this genuinely part of the story?

And then we get to the part of this entire charade which irritates me the most. The purposely dated-looking filter in the entire movie. It's the one thing that grinds my gears worse than Jar Jar Binks because it's there the entire film, giving it such a dated look when the whole thing took place a measly thirty-two years before A New Hope. It further sucks the life and energy out of the film and dilutes it into a bleak two hours further depriving the film of the Star Wars feeling which ebbed, emanated and flowed through the original three films so spectacularly. This isn't even really a Star Wars film, it's more like a behind-the-scenes look on the Republic, it's Senate and all the pretentious clods who occupy it. At least Attack of the Clones and Revenge Of The Sith both have more exciting storylines and allow the few decent actors a little more room to do their own thing as they are meant to. None of that can be the case for Phantom though, this is the film where Star Wars crashed and burned worse than that one fighter that was shot down before even getting into space in the Battle of Naboo scene.

It's that big of a let down."
"Feb 03, 2016",4,I don't think it's nearly as bad as everyone says.
"Feb 02, 2016",2,"The problem with the movie is that it just doesn't feel like star wars. now I respect that Lucas tried to do something different instead of copying more than half the plot of original triology, but created too lazy plot and characters (Jar Jar) and politics which no one wanted to see. Liam Neeson and Evan McGregor was great in the movie but Idk that same bout Jake Lloyd in the movie. Obi wan and qui gon showed no fear while chopping any of those shitty droids, also the Jedi coucil just discussed things except for doing anything, first of all they reject little ani and all of sudden just accept for his training? why? God! over all its a disappointing prequel, although there will be fans of these films for their CGI and non sensical humour and action. The ewoks were a hint what would the new star wars movie would be, but I. guess the audience ignored it lol..."
"Jan 30, 2016",2.5,"El orígen y el principio. Esta peli no me pareció tan buena (hasta me dio sueño), pero la batalla final: Increíble."
"Jan 30, 2016",3,The expansion of the Star Wars world in the first of the prequels is lush and beautiful...and the story less so. The subplot with Queen Amidala saving Naboo is great but I could skip the first half of the film. Liam Neeson as Qui Gon Jinn is spectacular!
"Jan 29, 2016",3,"""Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace"" (1999) is the story of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and his struggle to come into his own as a Jedi in the Jedi Order, which fights for the safety of the Galactic Republic. His master is Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), who, we learn, is not as shape as we would like him to be.

Nor is the rest of the Jedi Order. The Dark Side of the Force is awakening in the galaxy, and yet all of the Jedi Masters seem to be oblivious to it. We, the audience, however, can already see the machinations. Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is the real Secret (Not-So-Secret) Big Bad and he is succeeding on two fronts. On the one hand, he is using his Sith (read: evil) powers to create a new hidden order through his agent Darth Maul (Ray Park). On the other hand, he is using a trade embargo to push through more executive power for himself in the Galactic Senate. As soon as he gets elected chancellor, he knows he can use his political cunning to reshape the Galactic Republic into a dictatorship at his command.

Again, the Jedi Knights seem to be totally oblivious to what is really happening, which is why the world we are introduced to in this film seems to be out of sorts from the jump. The Galactic Republic, for example, has no control over parts of the galaxy in the outer realm and furthermore their politicians and warriors do not even sense evil when it is right in front of their faces.

This is, to be sure, the worst of the Star Wars films but it is by no means a bad movie. Compared to other Sci-Fi Adventure films, this is a perfectly adequate enjoyable film, and everyone needs to see it."
"Jan 27, 2016",3,"I thought Star Wars 1 was ok. But they had a character that was not the best for this movie his name is Jar Jar he is annoying and was not a good fit for this movie. But the villain was a good set to this movie and there where good light saber fights with the Jedi fighting, and fighting the Sith. So if you are a fan you should see this movie"
"Jan 27, 2016",1.5,"Terrible CG, terrible writing, and terrible acting. At least the world building is better than the original."
"Jan 26, 2016",3,"Not one of George Lucas's best work, Star Wars episode I The Phantom Menace, was one of the most disappointing Star Wars movies of all time. Even though there were still good elements to it, it does a terrible job keeping you in it. The only cool part about this film, was Darth Maul, played by Ray Park, who does a terrific job, playing his role. This film can cause you to lose faith in the franchise, but don't give up hope, there's still good qualities in this film, even though the prequels get a little bit better, the last film in the saga gives you a little hope in the saga."
"Jan 25, 2016",1.5,"Episode 1 has its good moments, however Jar Jar Binks ruins it all"
"Jan 24, 2016",2,"I think there are some pretty cool moments that happen throughout the this film. However, the over abundance of CGI (heavily dated now I might add), and poor efforts at comic relief make this star wars movie cringe worthy to watch in its entirety.  When I start the star wars saga, it usually has this movie removed.  One day I plan to make my own edit of this movie into about 30 minutes of the material I enjoy."
"Jan 24, 2016",1,Cheeseball space fluff. Pathetically unfunny. Very sad. ...
"Jan 23, 2016",2.5,Wow was this a letdown.
"Jan 23, 2016",3.5,"At least it had a plot good plot and casting in my opinion but my main problem with this film is the CGI. This is one of the prequels to 4,5 and 6 and yet they still decide to make it modern not old-fashioned. In this galaxy they  they had great technology in the past and forgot about it in the future. What! Overall, it's a all-right film with a few things that could of been better."
"Jan 23, 2016",3,"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is my least favorite Star Wars movie. I don't really care for movies that show the beginning of the characters so that's pretty much why. Jar Jar Binks is my fave. Darth Maul is pretty legit, his double sided lightsaber is awesome! But yeah, not the best prequel I've seen."
"Jan 21, 2016",2,"Watched The Phantom Menace for the first time in a decade, and now I hate everything that has ever existed.

What utter bilge. Jar Jar is so much worse than I remembered. And I remembered hating him. Gains an extra star for Ray Park. And that's about it."
"Jan 19, 2016",2.5,The only redeeming part of the movie is the score by John Williams.
"Jan 18, 2016",5,Dont really understand why people hate this movie so much just because of jar jar its ridiculous my sister who never watched star wars until now (2015) loved this film of all the most and personally it wasn't my favorite either but i certainly didn't hate it
"Jan 16, 2016",5,Good interesting movie regardless of it's shortcomings.
"Jan 15, 2016",1,"Adds nothing to the franchise's story, is boring to an extent that I have to turn it off part way through and really doesn't set a good start for the franchise if you are watching them episodically"
"Jan 15, 2016",2.5,"The Phantom Menace has done something no other Star wars movie has done,be pretty bad."
"Jan 15, 2016",1,"Oh, gosh this movie sucks."
"Jan 13, 2016",2.5,"With bland, annoying characters and boring dialogue this is a terrible addition to the classic trilogy. At least the prequels get better as they move along."
"Jan 13, 2016",2.5,"The first episod of this legendary Saga isn't a masterpiece, and by far. The global ambient is really childish, and most of the jokes (especially Missa ones) are part of this line.

The variety of characters and races laying the fundation for a futur story that will be both rich and complex. 

Technicaly, the fights scenes are good, the soundtrack are ok but not unforgettables (except for the introduction's track of course), and the settings are greats. The transitions between two scenes are sometimes quiet weird and appeared neglected.

To conclude, Star Wars I : The Phantom Menace is a good movie of space battles, but they are some elements which are showing that this saga is going to be much more than simply some fights in the space. The movie isn't a masterpiece, but laying the fundation of a saga which have a great potential."
"Jan 11, 2016",3,"Return of the Jedi was a big step down after the quality of the first two films, but The Phantom Menace represents a further drop in quality, marking it as the first truly mediocre Star Wars movie. Diehards will find many things of worth here, particularly the freewheeling exploration of hitherto unseen corners of the galaxy far, far away, but most audience members will find the movie sterile, if spectacular. in turns Everything at the core of the original trilogy's popularity was jettisoned, and the result is niche filmmaking buoyed by brand recognition."
"Jan 10, 2016",2.5,"A decent entry in the Star Wars series, but unfortunately, poorly executed."
"Jan 09, 2016",1.5,That's simply bullshit...
"Jan 08, 2016",0.5,Jar Jar Binks. Nuff said.
"Jan 08, 2016",3,"Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first - the midi-chlorian thing was a weird way to explain the force. Star Wars was always more fantasy than sci-fi and that was ok. Still, it's a small enough part of the movie to not really care about it. Bad thing 2 - the Gungan's weapons were kind of odd, they just didn't seem very intimidating or effective. Yet, they were high tech-like because they seemed to be made of energy specifically designed to stop drones. They were supposed to be a less technologically advanced society, and many people criticized their representation as stereotypical. 

While this is probably true and a very valid question, I think the creators of the Phantom Menace failed while trying to represent different languages, accents, and intergalactic culture in a way similar to the human experience on earth. The disappointing result looked something like: oppressive white people, greedy Asians (the trade federation), and lovable but less advanced indigenous peoples. In a fantasy movie about war, I can see the desire to simulate something like the experience of war on earth, but the closeness to racial stereotypes of actual humans was done pretty poorly. Third, the character of Jar Jar Binks was there to add low-brow or child-centered comic relief, often about bodily functions, and did little to advance the story or give any dignity to the Gungans. Next, many people complained about the child actor Jake Lloyd who played Anakin Skywalker. First of all, it's tough to act like a kid, especially when the kid is not just being a normal kid, and kids don't act or talk with the same mannerisms as adults. Some of his ""woo hoo""s sounded awkward, but that's kind of what kids sound like growing up. Lastly, the film looks a lot like a cartoon in places, that's not as visually appealing as the models of the earlier installments, but it works, and it's pretty in its own right.

Now that I've cleared that air, what we have left is a story of the origin of Darth Vader and the Gallactic Empire. It includes some pretty great light saber battles, and decent character building. The real star of the movie is Darth Maul, and it's a shame that he didn't make it to the sequel. Getting ahead of myself, I think it would have been entirely plausible to keep him in place of Christopher Lee in the rest of the series. 

At 2:16 minutes, The Phantom Menace doesn't really drag because the story is pretty complicated, including some political background of the Empire. It also offers the first glimpse at the Jedi council which lets viewers imagine future light saber battles in the coming episodes. 

After a revisit, I found the Phantom Menace to be a fitting first installment to the prequels. It successfully portrayed the Emperor as a politician, showed the pedigree of Luke Skywalker as coming from Jedi and Royalty, introduced a slick looking city-planet Coruscant, and provided enough action and adventure to entertain for what it was."
"Jan 07, 2016",5,"Great Film! Only but hurts like mr. Plinkett hates these films, NUFF SAID"
"Jan 07, 2016",2,"Inspired more by video game culture than the pop culture phenomenon that spawned it, the Phantom of one-note characters and overly-busy plotpoints Menaces this frenetic candy-colored prequel starter from the get-go. Ill-conceived and ill-executed, this eye-popping sugar rush ends up to be as childishly simplistic as the original film seemed to be. George Lucas once smartly gave up the reins to this franchise but foolishly brings down the glory of his past triumphs by failing to channel any of their cinematic greatness. Worse, nothing really monumental happens.

In this PG-rated sci-fi adventure, two Jedi Knights escape a hostile blockade to find allies and come across a young boy who may bring balance to the Force, but the long dormant Sith resurface to reclaim their old glory. 

Shouldered with one-note material, Neeson tries valiantly to act around insipid dialogue and an overly-busy plot. It's impossible to rescue the film from oblivion when he has to share screen time with an apple-cheeked, over-acting kid and amphibious, floppy-eared, Reggae-sounding, comic relief in the form of Jar Jar Binks. A horribly miscalculated attempt at branding a new fan favorite sidekick a la R2-D2, this annoyance proves to be the entertainment equivalent of one of Jabba the Hut's stools. Even the action in Phantom amounts to very few thrills, the frenetic CG-rendered goings-on quickly divesting your attention span. Soulless, slipshod, plastic, and boring, the film makes for a dull origin story. And it bears repeating: Worse, nothing really monumental happens.

Bottom line: The Force Slumbers"
"Jan 07, 2016",3,"Although the prequels can't be compared with the original trilogy whatsoever, they are still an entertainment on their own. But CGI effects looks very outdated now."
"Jan 06, 2016",3.5,"I don't know why people hate this movie this is a ok movie but the action, pacing is pretty good and it's still my favorite prequel even better than rouge one"
"Jan 06, 2016",3,"Honestly, I don't know why this film got so much hate. I liked it. Sure it wasn't the best Star Wars film. But it's not the worst....
Though.... ""Go die Jar Jar Binks"""
"Jan 06, 2016",2.5,"Watched it again after a long time. Saw way too many reviews that pointed out all the flaws in the movie and you're now just watching it to see one flaw transition into the next. Does have its moments, but the fact that I'm still having troubles to describe the way the main characters act makes it somewhat obvious this movie leaves a lot to be desired."
"Jan 06, 2016",3,"I first watched Star Wars The Phantom Menace when I was 13 years old and I thought it was a good film, now that I am 28 years old and watching it again I feel a lot different about it.  Some things about the movie are still good, the visuals and the music but other things I notice a lot more now. 

The dialogue for some of the scenes is bad, Jar Jar Binks and the gungans should never of really been in the movie, Darth Maul should never of been killed off and I agree with most people who say ""Anakin should of been introduced as much older and already trained"".

I don't think we need to see Anakin as a boy, it also makes the love story later on in the series to seem a bit creepy as Padme is much older than Anakin.  I agree with people who say it was the most anticipated film of all time and I believe that even if this was a very good film some people still would of been disappointed.  I think also being a prequel it makes it harder for the audience to get excited etc etc because with prequels you already know the basic story if you have watched the original trilogy.

We know who Obi-Wan is already, we know who Anakin becomes, we know that Senator Palpatine will become the emporer, things like that.  We know at some point Padme will die as well since she ain't in the original trilogy. 

All in all, The Phantom Menace isn't terrible, It is just the weakest film in the Star Wars saga.  I'd still recommend watching it, unless you are a Star Wars fanboy who will insist you skip this movie and just start with Attack of the clones."
"Jan 06, 2016",2.5,"Viewing this film at a young age I was mesmerized by the light sabers and gungans. But after watching years later, I started noticing the flaws in it. Unfortunately I wasn't the biggest fan of this Star Wars movie, this the only one I didn't really like."
"Jan 04, 2016",0.5,George Lucas' attempt at a political sci-fi thriller is unfortunately boring and uninteresting.
"Jan 04, 2016",0.5,"This made $950 million. It is a testament to the fact that the film industry cares nothing about about art, story writing, acting, or soul to making films, as long as it makes money. it should go down as one of the worst movies of all time, down in the depths of Battlefield Earth. This is the most unwatchable of the Star Wars movies, and nothing, but nothing redeems it."
"Jan 03, 2016",4,Strong nostalgia here. Pod racing/Sith Lords/Baby Anakin.
"Jan 03, 2016",1,"Maybe if Liam Neeson was more important, maybe if the plot didn't revolve around trade negotiations, maybe if It had a protagonist, maybe if Jar Jar want just so offensive, but as it is, it just seems like somebody just accidentally stepped in the poopy."
"Jan 03, 2016",3.5,"Its flaws are copious, but The Phantom Menace succeeds in ushering in ""a more civilized time"" where Jedi were numerous and, quite frankly, awesome. 

Lucas did indeed fail in bringing a childlike whimsy to his new prequel trilogy. The humor was horrendous and characterization offensive, and it made very little sense to pair this style with several diplomatic meetings. 

However, the few Jedi interactions we receive are fantastic. Qui Gon and Obi Wan's chemistry is great, the lightsaber play is quite improved in skill, and the final duel is mesmerizing and emotionally impactful. If only Lucas had leaned on this aspect of the film, maybe so many fans wouldn't look back on the Phantom Menace with disdain."
"Jan 03, 2016",3,Not as bad as everybody rants about. Jar Jar Binks isn't as bad either and the film provides stunning visuals along with a great explanation for the past.
"Jan 03, 2016",4,"I don't see why people hate this movie
Yeah it's a bit over the top with the cgi but overall I found it very entertaining"
"Jan 02, 2016",4.5,Everything but the lengthy pod racing scene was great.
"Jan 02, 2016",2.5,"The second Star Wars trilogy in the saga has a less-than-stellar start as compared with A New Hope. This is still a Star Wars movie, and can stand on its own as an entertaining sci-fi adventure into the Star Wars universe, with special effects and action sequences that are better than ever. But the movie just doesn't have the rich characters and cinematic scale of the original trilogy. There is a sort of soul and edge in the original trilogy that is absent here. Oh, and then there's Jar Jar Binks..."
"Jan 02, 2016",1,"the two things that ruin this movie are the stupid kid, and jar jar. Change both of those and the movie could have been ok. The fight at the end with dearth maul is cool, but we don't know who dearth maul is so we don't care. But we don't really care about the two boring jedi's either. Cgi makes things look plastic and fake and it makes you tune out. The stupid kid just makes me angry. I like the movie more when it first came out, now I really hate it."
"Jan 02, 2016",2,"This movie was a horrific disaster and a terrible beginning to the prequels of the Star Wars saga. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because of the entertaining battle scene between Qui-Gon Jin and Obi-Wan Kenobi versus Darth Maul. There were only three important pieces of information in this movie, that Obi-Wan's master was Qui-Gon, that Anakin was from the planet Tatooine, and that Anakin is very strong in the force. All three of these facts could have easily been shown in two flashbacks, or three sentences. But it was definitely not worth a whole movie, that's why it felt so stretched, they were trying to hit the two hour marker and with a lack of material, they had to fill it in with unnecessary, boring scenes. This movie was a massive disappointment and could have been done a lot better."
"Jan 01, 2016",3,It's not a very well made movie but it has a few redeeming things like Darth Maul and the acting of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. The pod race was pretty cool and the lightsaber fight was fun to watch. It's not a bad movie it was just disappointing.
"Jan 01, 2016",2,A useless film that even Ewan Macgregor can't save. Misa hated every minute
"Jan 01, 2016",0.5,This is the worst film ever made by a human.
"Dec 31, 2015",1,"Just awful. Bad acting, bad script, bad characters, bad CG, bad plot, and most of all bad direction. George Lucas is a hack if he thinks that this level of emotion in acting is acceptable, if jar jar binks is a funny, and if the plot makes any sense."
"Dec 31, 2015",3.5,"Good, But Not Great

Originally Written May 19, 1999--
Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is a young apprentice Jedi Knight under the tutelage of Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson); Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who will later father Luke Skywalker and become known as Darth Vader, is just a 9-year-old boy. When the Trade Federation cuts off all routes to the planet Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter.

It's been 22 years since the original ""Star Wars"" first hit movie screens. The original Star Wars Trilogy ranks as one of the most critically rated and beloved trilogies of all time. So it was only a matter of time before George Lucas began the Prequel Trilogy. While it's awesome that a new Star Wars film is now out in theaters, this chapter seemed a little off. We'll have to wait to see what happens from here, but in the meantime, Jar Jar Binks and company get three-and-a-half stars."
"Dec 31, 2015",4.5,es por esta pelicula que soy Fan de StarWars
"Dec 31, 2015",2.5,Too much about politics and Jar Jar gets pretty damn annoying. But the Darth Maul fight was the best part
"Dec 30, 2015",5,"I've seen this movie three times this year and, guess what? I like it even more each time. The scale of the universe Lucas showed in the Original Trilogy is expanded in this movie to incomparable scales. And the politics, since I was a teenager I came to love Star Wars because it is more than just a plain good vs bad action story. And this would not had happen without episode I. Easily, at leas for me, the most important movie of all 7."
"Dec 30, 2015",2,"Ahh, The Phantom Menace. What a glorious pile of horse feces this movie is. In its BORING execution, George Lucas manages to find some decent rhythm in his writing and overall character design, but outside of that, it is what it is, a money hungry/childish vision of what Star Wars originally meant. The plot is painful. The acting, even strikingly worse. ""Phantom"" is the definition of disappointment."
"Dec 30, 2015",2,Ewwwwww so boring this is by far the worst Star Wars movie it's pathetic it gets its 2 star for the about 2 good action sequences it wasted it's talented cast the only thing that can redeem this movie is if the darth jar jar theory is used in the new trilogy
"Dec 30, 2015",2.5,"Star Wars Episode I: Phantom Menace is a really disappointing movie that has some poor and forgettable characters, like Jar Jar and that guy that is the slave master of the Skywalker family, I don't know his name though, because as I said, they're forgettable and sometimes incredibly annoying. Also I found the ending kind of ridiculous. Let's not forget one of the antagonists in this movie, the one with red and black skin. He's just absurdly underdeveloped, and it seems like he is just there to look cool with his double lightsaber. He's also too quiet for my taste and at least he should have had a cool line or something, but no, this guy's monotone. The battle scenes were good, with the exception of the battle scene of Jar Jars vs Droids, I didn't quite like it. The acting and overall writing is a mixed bag. As for Anakin, I didn't care for him, but that's maybe because he's a kid in this movie. However, I liked Obi One and his master as characters, and also the queen was OK. So, overall, an average movie"
"Dec 30, 2015",3,"This film has a terrible reputation, but extracted from the unprecedented pressure and glow of the franchise, it's actually a good sci-fi movie. The political aspects are dry, but for its time The Phantom Menace has some iconic scenes, including the Darth Maul duel and the pod racing (even if people thought those scenes were 'meaningless'). The Darth Maul duel, for my money, is potentially the best lightsaber duel in the franchise (in terms of fight mechanics, not emotion). That double saber is just the tops. So, while Episode I has its gaping weaknesses, unburdened from expectations it's quite enjoyable!"
"Dec 29, 2015",2,"Bland acting all around. No performances stand out. The story is confusing and mixed with politics that aren't really clear and gives no reason why we as a audience should care. The film fails in it's story execution and acting and the imagery is full of CGI in places where there doesn't need to be, but the imagination of George Lucas is still strong in this film."
"Dec 29, 2015",4,Really liked the back drop to it even though not a big d SyFy person.
"Dec 29, 2015",2.5,the movie is meh but it gets way to much hate
"Dec 28, 2015",4.5,So cute is Anakin Skywalker
"Dec 28, 2015",2.5,Very disappointing. I wouldn't say its the worst but its close to it. It has its moments but nothing can filter out Jar Jar and little Anakin Skywalker.
"Dec 28, 2015",3.5,I really don't think this film is as bad as everyone makes out. I get that it was disappointing but I wouldn't say it's significantly worse than Attack of the Clones. At least this Anakin can act. It does seem more aimed at younger audiences but what's wrong with that? I feel like it appealed to the kid in all of us and let us have a little fun in the Star Wars universe.
"Dec 28, 2015",2.5,"Razones por las cuales esta entrega de ""Star Wars"" apesta: 

1. Mucho diálogo insulso y cretino (bla, bla, bla... ¿cuándo se van a callar y van comenzar a pelear?)
2. Situaciones traídas de los cabellos e inaceptables (¿una carrera de autos en una galaxia lejana?  ¿Anakin Skywalker creo a C3PO?, ¿La fuerza tiene que ver con corpúsculos en la sangre?... ¡¡¡Por favor!!)
3. Efectos especiales terribles (demasiado CGI), pocas peleas y tan rápidas que no valen la pena.
4. Actuaciones de piedra: Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman... Todos grandes actores y ninguno se destaca.
5. Jar-Jar Binks.... ¿Tengo que decir mas?.

P.d.  ¿Para qué ver una película mediocre en 3D?  ¡No pierda su dinero!"
"Dec 28, 2015",3,After rewatching it again I have to say I enjoyed it very much
"Dec 28, 2015",3,"Too far from the originals and kiddy to be truly amazing, but still it's a Star Wars film."
"Dec 27, 2015",2,"I used to love this movie as a child. Suffice to say, nine-year old me had much lower standards. I will say that Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor make for great leads and stand out as the only good performances in the film. The final act is actually alright, with the lightsaber duel holds up. 

However, that doesn't excuse the fact that the movie is an absolute drag prior to the final act. Being boring is probably the worst sin a Star Wars movie can commit, seeing as these are supposed to be fun blockbusters. The overabundance of CGI, a supporting cast that comes of as uninterested, and the infamous celluloid cancer that is Jar-Jar Binks don't do the film any favors either.
Verdict: C-"
"Dec 27, 2015",2.5,Just not that for which I'd hoped.
"Dec 27, 2015",3,The ending saves the film
"Dec 27, 2015",5,"The first Star Wars movie I saw as a child. I enjoyed the chemistry between Neeson and McGregor, and thought the fight scenes were particularly well choreographed."
"Dec 27, 2015",2,Horrible acting and laughable characters.
"Dec 27, 2015",4,"Got to say I still enjoyed the movie on my second watch after 15 years. The movie builds up the Star Wars world beautifully, the story is well scripted keeping the plot solid and intriguing, the cast superb in their performances, Darth Maul looks and acts a worthy advisory to the Jedi's, the desert race is intensely crafted, overall  the special effects still looked good even after it being more than a decade old. On my first watch I remember not liking the character of Jar Jar binks, his stupid characterization humor was annoying, it's funny how I enjoyed him on my second watch."
"Dec 26, 2015",4,"It's baffling to see why people hate on this film as much as they do. This is the only Star Wars movie who's main character isn't a whiny brat and one that can actually act. Jake Lloyd has this natural charisma about him that allows him to portray Anakin as flawlessly as somebody could. The supporting actors do a fine job as well and the story is well put together. For the first time in Star Wars history, the politics of interplanetary cooperation is explored and the result makes for an interesting storyline. The best part of this movie, however, is Darth Maul, one of the more memorable villains and his parts in this movie are certainly captivating. Phantom Menace is quite an enjoyable film, although it still garners hate from many Star Wars fans."
"Dec 26, 2015",2.5,The final duel between Darth Maul and Qui-gon saves Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace from being a complete waste.
"Dec 25, 2015",3.5,This isn't nearly as bad as legend would have you believe.
"Dec 25, 2015",1.5,Meesa no like dis moovie
"Dec 25, 2015",5,This is the most underrated Star Wars film! Almost no one likes it yet it sets up the entire franchise and it is incredibly written.
"Dec 25, 2015",3.5,"My marathon continues but opinions do not change. One of the best parts of 4,5,6 was that though the background score was omnipresent, it wasn't jarring. Here, it was painful."
"Dec 24, 2015",3.5,"Rating: 67%
The acting, importance of the story, and fun characters are obviously missing from the previous films, but Phantom Menace mostly makes up for that with dazzling visuals and a sinister villain."
"Dec 24, 2015",3,"I hate to say it, but there are many things that I still like about this movie. 

Likes:

Music. Duel of the Fates is Amazing.
Costumes. Well done.
Coruscant. What is there not to like.
Lightsaber battles are still dazzling. 
Liam Neeson. I actually liked his character.
Shmi Skywalker was pretty cool actually. I liked her. 

Dislikes

The Jarring Character. You know the one.
Wooden acting by the kids. 
Stupid cameos that feel forced.
3CPO should never have had that dumb origin. 
Yipee!
Asian and primitive stereotyping in aliens was pretty terrible. 
If only we could take out some of that wooden acting and stupid self-referencing crap, we'd have a serviceable film here. 
Jedi were a bunch of dicks who didn't seem to know what they were doing. Only Liam Neeson knew what was up."
"Dec 24, 2015",2.5,GOOD VILLAIN BELOW AVERAGE MOVIE.....
"Dec 24, 2015",2,"Actually not terrible.  However a few things ruin this movie.  The racist stereotype aliens Jar Jar, the Gungans, and Trade Federation Race.    The Metachlorians also shit all over the cool thing the force used to be.  Darth Maul is cool but has no characterization."
"Dec 23, 2015",3.5,Criminally underrated.
"Dec 23, 2015",1,"Even the positive things about this film (of which there are few) still don't quite work.  Darth Maul is a decent new addition to the series but is bizarrely underused and then promptly killed off.  The pod race section is quite fun and exciting but Lucas can't help but populate all the other racers with nauseating CGI wacky races characters.  The bad things, you could go on all day, the terrible casting, the green screening of everything so people spend the entire film gazing into middle space, the dire plot about taxation and trade embargoes, the technology being better than in the later films, the shoe-horning in of much loved characters even if it makes no logical or plot sense, Lucas just filling the screen from corner to corner with CGI shite...literally just everywhere, like one of his droids threw up over the film and of course Jar Jar...bleedin Binks."
"Dec 23, 2015",3,"Great actors, great visuals and an epic final duel, but a nonsensical plot and even more nonsensical characters."
"Dec 23, 2015",3.5,A decent start to a new saga. Great casting choices in Qui gon jin and darth mall. we could have done without jar jar. I really enjoyed the pod race and the ending lightsaber fight.
"Dec 22, 2015",1.5,This movie is terrible
"Dec 22, 2015",4.5,"This was a pretty cool movie when it came out. The soundtrack is epic. The saber duels were exciting when it was released. Neeson, McGregor, and Park were awesome.  Story was good. Why does everyone hate it???"
"Dec 22, 2015",3.5,"Ok, I didn't think Ep. 1 was as bad as everyone said it was --Lucas pretty much followed the same formula as he did with the previous saga -- a few key battlescenes, introducing another alien allaince (jar jar) and a glorious finish. Granted I feel gyp'ed by the sudden introduction of this mighty Sith and the rise of the evil emperor, but Liam Neeson is a worthy match to Alec Guiness's Obi-Wan in the earlier films, and the character playing young Anakin is precocious and adorably memorable."
"Dec 22, 2015",3,"Only got 3 stars because it's Star Wars.  George Lucas was trying to appeal to kids, rather than all audiences.  I could have also done without the podracing too."
"Dec 22, 2015",2.5,"When I was younger I used to LOVE this film and all of the prequels due to their amazing special effects, however I have watched it now and it is not as great as I remembered it to be. Even though it is quite a bad film I have been lenient and given it 2 and a half stars - even though it is not really good enough for that - since I watched a fan edit of this film which was nearly a whole hour shorter, and that was a four and a half star film, at least. Yet I really do hate the young Anakin Skywalker's acting and feel that this is what mostly downgrades the film. Furthermore, the lightsaber battles in this film are absolutely spectacular and definitely more stunning to watch than any of the lightsaber battles in previous films, yet they do not have as much of an emotional attachment with them. A final problem about this film is that LOADS of it is just boring politics, which no one wants."
"Dec 22, 2015",5,"A monumental masterpiece in Kino, 16/17."
"Dec 22, 2015",2,"Besides the action there is not much good to say about the Phantom Menace. It is a very frustrating movie to watch because of it's convoluted story and uninteresting characters. George Lucas said,  ""I think I went a bit too far in a few places (with this movie)"". Ya think George?"
"Dec 21, 2015",2,The beginning is horrible. So cheesy. And the acting is so bad and cliche. I last watched it when I was in 8th grade and I can see why I never watched it again and forgot about until I decided to catch up with the restart of the series.
"Dec 21, 2015",3,Overall not a bad movie. The graphics are way better than the previous three films. Though some of the characters are a bit childish and cheesy. I must say Darth Maul was A good villain although I'm not quite sure why I think that because he didn't last very long. He was still pretty cool. Fight scenes were pretty epic. And young Anakin Skywalker was pretty awesome. Overall not too bad but a little bit too much CGI characters.
"Dec 21, 2015",3.5,"I think it's become a fad to dislike the prequels.  I think Episode 1 is a good movie and for me, having played a lot of the Star Wars games, I for one was really interested to know more about the Old Republic.  So I really enjoyed it although the acting was pretty bad in some parts.  That's just typical Lucas directing.  Jake Lloyd didn't quite do it.  And the pod race was way too long.  But Liam Neeson really delivered in the movie and I would've liked to have seen him in the other 2 prequels.  All in all, I think it was a good movie."
"Dec 21, 2015",2.5,"The first Episode in the mega Star Wars franchise flops and flails hard. It's just rather boring. Too cartoony for me. The characters are typical cartoon fare, with talking fish-like kings and that idiot Jar Jar Binks clumsily fumbling about. For a franchise like Star Wars, a pod race shouldn't be considered the climactic action sequence. Sure, we meet Anakin/Darth Vader as a good child destined for greatness, and Obi-Wan losing his mentor, and a pretty cool villain in Darth Maul, but overall, it doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie."
"Dec 21, 2015",1.5,"The Phantom Menace is boring, it makes no sense, its characters are not interesting and it's especially disappointing compared to the original Star Wars trilogy. It doesn't even matter and adds nothing to the saga. What else can I say about The Phantom Menace that hasn't been said already? It's terrible."
"Dec 20, 2015",0.5,"Makes me wish I didn't have ears or eyes to witness such a disgrace. Except for the Darth Maul fight, that was sick."
"Dec 20, 2015",2.5,"The thing what I know about ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" was that the trailer of this movie was quite amazing and surprisingly, there have been a lot of bad reviews when it first came out in theaters. Having myself going back at it and watching it again, it was actually much worse than I thought it would've been. It is terribly disappointed, sort of. 

There are things in the film that are quite amazing, but there are also other things in the film that are just badly done. What make this film worth seeing are the visual effects. The pod race sequence, which many people refer back to the Chariot Race in ""Ben-Hur"", is amazing. The scene of where Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi are having a lightsaber battle with Darth Maul is impressive. The production design is beautiful to look at. The sound effects are astounding. But when, the film falls down to plot and characters, they're not as impressive as the visual effects or the other good things that I brought up in my review.

There's of course, bad acting in the film. Natalie Portman's performance is kind of mediocre, although I do like her in general. Ahmed Best does the voice of Jar Jar Binks, and it's true of what a lot people say about his character, he is certainly unfunny and annoying. Jake Lloyd, who plays young Anakin Skywalker, is actually a real problem for me. I find his acting completely wooden, and I don't think he delivers anything at all good to the screen. However, I wouldn't want to say that all the actors in this movie are terrible. I think that Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor do a fine job of what they're doing. As for the dialogues, they're pretty dreadful. I was actually quite bored by these characters of where they're having these long, serious conversations to one another.

I can tell you honestly, I don't really at all hate this film like everybody else did, and I wasn't furiously angry at it either, but I was sort of disappointed with it. 2/4"
"Dec 20, 2015",5,"Still a great movie. One of the most stunningly creative movies ever made. Yes, the acting can be a little stilted, and Jar Jar is an acquired taste, to say the least, but the Phantom Menace captures that same sense of wonder that Star Wars did for me in 1977. Just forget the hipster coolness of bashing it and enjoy the movie!"
"Dec 20, 2015",1,"Lucas showing his true talent here, like a Pizza delivery boy, who found away to use the same cardboard boxes and sell them twice."
"Dec 20, 2015",0.5,Worst movie ever period
"Dec 19, 2015",2.5,"Not even Darth Maul in all his badassery can make up for the wooden acting, poor CGI, bland characters, and the cinematic equivalent of Syphilis (AKA Jar Jar Binks)"
"Dec 19, 2015",1.5,This bad prequel should keep it's rotten score.
"Dec 19, 2015",1.5,"I've managed to convince myself that this movie is okay, but I'm probably gonna go on hating it in the future. 3/10"
"Dec 19, 2015",1.5,This movie is a Jabba sized Bantha turd. Step in that Jar Jar.
"Dec 19, 2015",3,"There are a few noteworthy and fun moments, but it's ultimately too stiff, hollow and talky."
"Dec 19, 2015",5,"Podracing, Jar Jar, and Darth Maul I will forever love!"
"Dec 19, 2015",0.5,George Lucas and his obsequious yes men created one of biggest turds to ever grace the silver screen.
"Dec 19, 2015",2,Starting the prequel marathon...
"Dec 19, 2015",3.5,"Although probably the worst of the movies due to occasionally annoying characters (jar jar) and fairly bad acting by the kid Skywalker, let's not forget the positives. The introduction of Liam Neeson as qui gon jin, Samuel l Jackson as master Windu, ewen macregor as obi Wan, and Nataly Portman, how hot was she when she was young? The fight with Darth maul was also arguably the best lightsaber battle in any of the star wars. Some boring moments like the gungans, but nothing unoriginal. New characters, good  cinematography, and did I mention Nataly Portman was hot?"
"Dec 19, 2015",3,"while it never quite lives up to its full potential, there are some things that do work really well"
"Dec 18, 2015",5,Actually better than the Last Jedi.
"Dec 18, 2015",3,"I actually enjoyed the second half of this film enough but the first half is so unnecessary and so tedious. The racing scene is ten minutes too long, the characters are not interesting compared to the later episodes, and it tries way too hard to connect everything to the overarching story. The creatures and effects are very cool but the action isn't that interesting and Darth Maul is hardly a foe in the slightest."
"Dec 18, 2015",0.5,"I can't say anything that hasn't been said before, but this laughable addition to the Star Wars saga is bloated with too many incoherent plot-lines that literally go nowhere for the overarching storyline and awful, AWFUL characters (you know who I'm talking about) that have absolutely no defining features and thoroughly terrible writing and acting. This plastic movie has 3 minutes of any interest at most, and you should stay far, far away from this schlock as I can say this without a doubt; this movie adds absolutely nothing to the story of Star Wars."
"Dec 18, 2015",3,Not as bad as some people say it is but it's still not really that great
"Dec 18, 2015",4,"Great film.

 Unfairly berated by  ""Die-hard"" fans of the original trilogy who expected to see another series of the same films but were given something new and original.

Not without it's shortcomings, the Phantom Menace is overall spectacular in both it's scope and originality given its task of setting the foundations of the Star Wars Universe."
"Dec 18, 2015",3.5,"Ok, I saw this when it was first released at the age of about 5 or 6, but not in the context of being a prequel to the original series. Watching it now, is still a somewhat confusing experience - the plot being all over the place and dwelling too long in places (the build up to the race being one - that said, it was rather spectacular and thrilling). Nonetheless, it was always going to be difficult to reproduce the experience of the originals, especially because that would entail ignoring all the wonderful CGI technology available, but The Phantom Menace isn't all that bad - it isn't as good as the originals (any of them, and probably will be the weakest of all the Star Wars films), but it is a good visual experience, and the second half is strong. Focusing on the political subtext of corruption, infiltration, and greed is when this film was at its highest heights. The Senator character is certainly a believeable one at least."
"Dec 18, 2015",3.5,"After watching this again in anticipation of the new Star Wars movie, it's not as bad as I remember. Yes It has some laughable dialogue and there's way too much CGI but it does have some exciting action scenes such as the final battle with Darth Maul and the pod race. Interesting to see how the Jedi were weary of Anakin as a child that he was susceptible to the Dark Side"
"Dec 17, 2015",2,"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace [Lucas, 1999] Keep quiet while I go to sleep. 4/10"
"Dec 17, 2015",2.5,"Fifteen years later, what do I really think about Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace? Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with the basic story or pacing of the film. Yeah, there's a few corny lines (""I care for you, too"") and extraneous exposition (midichlorians... yeah OK, interesting but not really necessary). But then again, it's Star Wars. The production design and special effects are awesome. These are family films so I understand Lucas' decision to go with battle droids because the 'body count' in Episode 1 is REALLY HIGH. But it's mostly mechanical bodies. Star Wars cannot become a bloodbath. There are really two BIG problems that drag down this film into a cesspool of mediocrity. The first is Jar Jar Binks. I don't need to describe the problems of this character since they are obvious and well-documented. The bigger problem is Jake Lloyd was and remains a horrible casting decision. First, Anakin Skywalker needs to be 3-4 years older in this film in order to better serve - and add realism to - the story (relationship with Padme, the climax, etc.). Once this is understood, then it is easy to see that Jake Lloyd should have never been cast in this film. The fact that he couldn't act only worsened the problem. Mark's Grade: C"
"Dec 17, 2015",2.5,not as bad as I remember
"Dec 17, 2015",4,"8/10... Jar Jar is quite annoying, but has much less screen time the second half of the movie.  The light saber duel at the end is epic.  What exactly does the Jedi Council do all day?"
"Dec 17, 2015",2,"Great Special Effects, but a real lack of character development. Lucas made a mistake placing a 10 year old Anakin in the movie. Anakin should have been 14/15 years old, and Amidala about 18/19. that way, in 10 years (Ep.II) the age difference doesn't seem so awful. Plus no ""yippeee!"". Further worsenng this film was the oddball Jar Jar, who is just not funny. The two Jedi, Qui Gon and Obi Wan, save this film every time we see them. The final confrontation with Darth Maul makes this film interesting in the end,"
"Dec 17, 2015",2,"So it all ""begins"" with The Phantom Menace. OMG THE WORSE SHTER WERSH MUVIE EVERRRRRR...

No. The Phantom Menace is not the worst in the series, I'd watch it without an issue, it's really ""Attack of the Clones"" that I'm reluctant to watch again.

I don't think the movie is all that bad, it's just boring. I also don't hate Jar Jar, he's not that annoying but he's a really useless character... Doesn't help that he's mostly CGI and none of the digital effects in this movie hope up that well...
With some positives: I do appreciate that 20% of this movie uses practical effects, Ewan McGregor is a great Obi-Wan, and I like the light saber duels in this movie. The Phantom Menace is boring and led to a much worst second episode, but it's far from being the worst movie ever made."
"Dec 17, 2015",2,Terrible Star Wars movie. But Darth Maul was cool. So there's that.
"Dec 17, 2015",2.5,Very very boring the fight at the end is the only reason this is 3 stars and not 1
"Dec 16, 2015",2.5,"Some people say this is better than Attack of the Clones, then there's those people who think Attack of the Clones is better than this. For me, it would've been a success if it didn't had... obviously... Jar Jar Binks bothering me throughout the entire movie and didn't pull out disappointments."
"Dec 16, 2015",1.5,"I have never understood the plot of the film, trade embargoes, really? So many annoying characters but the most by far of course Jah Jah Binks, how I hoped he would be killed. Everything that the original wasn't (in a bad way)  not many high points, it gets one just for being Star Wars, the next two did get better, but how could they get worse......"
"Dec 16, 2015",3,"Ok, I saw this when it was first released at the age of about 5 or 6, but not in the context of being a prequel to the original series.

"Dec 16, 2015",5,"TPM gets an unwarranted bad wrap for Jar jar alone. 

The film is a great start to the Saga. 

The Podrace was different but still an homage to the asteroid chase and the speederbike chase. 

And the Gungans are like aquatic Wookies to me, so they were perfect. 

I also LOVED seeing Coruscant finally! 

Darth Maul is a great villain as well. I was cheering Obi Wan on the whole time he fought Maul!"
"Dec 16, 2015",3.5,"I changed this from 2.5 to 3.5 stars as I've grown older.  The film basically feels like an independent film with a large budget.  As I've gotten older, I think I understand better the nuances of the plot better and what Lucas was going for with the Skywalker Saga."
"Dec 15, 2015",2,"Focusing only on the visual spectrum as a whole, it lack what the sequels, specifically ""Episodes 4-6,"" captured so easily, charm."
"Dec 15, 2015",3.5,It has to start somewhere...
"Dec 15, 2015",3.5,Everyone was so excited when this came out in '99...and what we got didn't quite recapture the magic. It's safe to say if you're ranking them 1-6 this is 6th. The pod racing is fun and the end fight between Darth Maul and the Jedis stands alone as the best part of this movie but otherwise it kind of drags. And we all know Jar Jar is Public Enemy #1.
"Dec 15, 2015",2.5,"While Star Wars episodes 4-6 lived up to their hype and delivered a stories that were fantastic. However it's the prequel that had that same hype that fails to be like the others. The reason that this movie is so bad is that it doesn't have the same humor, real set pieces, or even dialogue that the others had. What's sad is that the casting isn't all that great. Liam Nelson and Ewan McGregor (forgive me if that's wrong) are the only two things that make this movie great. Darth Maul is the only reason you'll still through this. Jar Jar Binks really isn't helping with anything in this movie. All in all at the end of watching this your asking your, ""Why would George Lucas do this?"""
"Dec 14, 2015",3,the story is not bad the only thing is the acting
"Dec 14, 2015",3,no es una mala pelicula para mi gusto es buena entretenida y con una buena historia pero eso si hay veces en que te confundes y algo que no me gusto es el villano si su look es amenazador y todo eso pero tiene poco tiempo en pantalla como para que le llamen amenaza
"Dec 14, 2015",2.5,"Valiant in its ambitions but disappointing in its performance, George Lucas' ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" still has its share of fun action and quiet moments, but at some points is too easily overshadowed by its wooden acting and over-reliance of CGI."
"Dec 14, 2015",3,"Was wäre wenn? Was wäre, wenn George Lucas Episode I nun tatsächlich der erste produzierte Teil der Serie wäre? Würden wir ihn nicht als Meisterwerk feiern? Ist es nicht schlicht und ergreifend so, dass wir die ""alten"" Episoden etwas verklären und infolgedessen unserem Ärger über die flachen Charaktere in Episode I Luft machen? Die Idee, nun die Vorgeschichte zu erzählen ist an sich visionär. Dabei scheint es unausweichlich, dass wir von der Tiefe der Charaktere etwas enttäuscht sind, denn wir kennen sie bereits und allzu viel Neues wird nicht an ihnen modelliert. Anakin Skywalker, der später zu Darth Vader mutieren wird, ist der einzig Neue. Viel Kritik war zu hören, dass alles zu kindgerecht sei. Nun, Anakin seines Zeichens, ist noch ein Kind. Alle Star Wars Teile waren eher grelle Comics mit fast überschwenglicher Popcorn Energie. Star Wars ist immer Effekt-Kino gewesen, ohne sich allzu viel um Ernsthaftigkeit zu bemühen. Genauso kommt Episode I daher und auch hier hat George Lucas einige wirklich schöne Bilder entworfen: Man denke nur an die Stadt unter Wasser oder die Kammer des Senats! Nicht selten meint man, in einer Plastik-Variante der ewigen Stadt Rom gelandet zu sein... Die Dialoge mögen einfach sein, aber nicht dümmlich. Manchmal versucht ihnen Drehbuch-Autor Lucas eine ""klassische"" Form zu geben wie es das SciFi Genre in den 70ern einmal hatte. Dialoge hin und her, zuallererst geht es aber um die Optik! Innerhalb seines eigenen Regel-Systems erzählt uns Lucas eine runde Geschichte, in welcher der Jedi Ritter Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) auf den jungen Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) trifft. Sofort bemerkt er, dass Anakin für grosse Aufgaben geschaffen ist. Während nun die Geschichte von Anakin erzählt wird, hält George Lucas einen fröhlichen Tonfall durch, der Star Wars schon immer von anderen SciFi Meisterwerken unterschied. Spannend sind die Verweise auf Anakins Angst, die ihm noch zum Verhängnis werden soll... Für George Lucas jedenfalls ist die Zukunft kein düsterer Ort. Die Episode I steht an der Spitze einer Entwicklung des Kinos, in welcher reale und digital animierte Sequenzen nebeneinander stehen. Gleichwohl ob reale oder imaginäre Landschaften, ob echte Charaktere oder digitale - alles scheint mühelos ineinander zu fliessen. Diesem Umstand verdanken die ""neuen"" Episoden ihren visionären Charakter. Die Episode I wendet sich an ein jüngeres Publikum, es ist ein Seifen-Oper im Weltraum geworden und wie argumentiert, beim besten Willen kein misslungener Film. mehr auf cinegeek.de http://cinegeek.de/star-wars-episode-i-die-dunkle-bedrohung-star-wars-episode-i-phantom-menace-1999-rating-73-dvd6028"
"Dec 13, 2015",3,"Somewhat disappointing when you compare it to its predecessors. All the talk about politics and such will likely confuse younger audiences, and most of the actors are pretty terrible. ESPECIALLY Jake Lloyd when he's not in that one scene where he leaves his mom as Anakin.

I'm not even gonna ask what Lucas was smoking or drinking when he was making this, nor am I gonna question why he thinks Jar Jar Binks is the best thing ever. This is Star Wars, George! Not Looney Tunes or Animaniacs!

I mean, the only thing Jar Jar does that's essential to the story is lead Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon Jinn to the Gungan homeworld. Although, that sequence with the city being revealed underwater is pretty good, as is the John Williams score. Good to know he's still around for the sequel trilogy!

The climaxes are pretty good, too. Some of the effects are as practical as the original trilogy, but mostly CGI, which kind of ruins the ""It's really there"" view. What happened, George?

To his credit, the CGI is still pretty good, too. And this was in 1999, when I was only a year old! The Pod Race has a great level of speed, the new ships are pretty cool, including the Naboo Starfighters. But strangely, they seem more advanced than the starfighters in the original. And this movie is a prequel! How does that work?

The swordfight at the final confrontation is awesome, though! A double-bladed lightsaber against 2 more! What are the odds of that?

Overall, I wouldn't even call this the worst out of the prequels, mainly because it didn't bore me. That's a key part to the Star Wars name.

Attack of the Clones, however? Just... no."
"Dec 13, 2015",3,"With some odd CGI and some very cardboard acting, this struggles to feel like a cohesive big budget film"
"Dec 13, 2015",2,"Hace mucho tiempo, en una galaxia muy, muy lejana y todo se fue al carajo.

Cuando las negociaciones de los Caballeros Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) y Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor) para detener el bloqueo en el planeta Naboo fallan, deben escapar al planeta y rescatar a la Reina Amidala (Portman). Con la nave atrofiada, deben parar en el planeta Tatooine donde conocen al joven Anakin Skywalker (Lloyd), quien los ayudará a repararla. Huyendo del misterioso Sith Darth Maul (Ray Park), quien tiene una misión que parece ser mucho más terrible de lo que todos creen.

¿Quién puede olvidar todo el hype que había en 1999 con el esperado regreso de Star Wars? No fue para nada diferente del que se vive ahora en 2015 con El Despertar de la Fuerza. Por lo que esperamos que no se repita lo que sigue al hype. No se puede negar que la mayoría de los que vimos esta película por primera vez, la amamos. Sólo tomó un par de veces más para darnos cuenta de que queríamos que Jar Jar muriera de forma lenta y dolorosa.

El film inicia y el texto inicial ya nos pone a dormir con términos que no asociamos con Star Wars: bloqueos, federaciones de comercio, embajadores, política, bla, bla, bla... Ésa debería haber sido la primera pista de que el film sería completamente como ningún otro film de Star Wars: aburrido. Lo entiendo. En Star Wars hubo una guerra, y para que hayan guerras debe haber política. Pero pasar toda la maldita película con el mismo tema aburre. ¡Así que tenemos al Emperador más joven! ¿Y qué hace? Habla. ¡Así que tenemos al Consejo Jedi! ¿Y qué hacen? Hablan. ¿Qué es lo peor? Lo que hablan ni siquiera es digno de ser dicho.
Así pasamos al problema mayoritario del film. El guión de George Lucas. Si algo nos quedó claro con la primera Star Wars es que Lucas es un genio. Lo que nos quedó claro con ésta es que es un genio, y también un pésimo guionista y director. La narrativa completa de la historia es inconsistente, con mayores puntos vacíos, y con líneas recicladas de las películas originales.

A medida que avanzamos por la dolorosa historia, nos damos cuenta de una de las pocas cosas positivas del film. Sus efectos especiales. Digan lo que digan sobre esta basura de película, se ve endemoniadamente bien. El CGI es impresionante, cuando es utilizado bien. Las naves, los ambientes, los aliens generados completamente por computador, todo funciona visualmente.
Lamentablemente, el CGI es también el que nos entrega a Jar Jar Binks, sin duda el personaje más odiado de la saga. Su ""humor"" dirigido a niños de 3 años se vuelve insoportable luego de 10 minutos de la introducción del personaje, imagina tenerlo como un personaje clave durante el resto de la película.

Otro de los problemas causados por el CGI es su efecto en la actuación del reparto. Si bien hay buen talento en el film gracias a Liam Neeson y Samuel L. Jackson, también hay jóvenes actores como Ewan McGregor y Natalie Portman, quienes en ese momento de su carrera realmente necesitaban un buen director que los encaminase a descubrir sus habilidades. Lamentablemente, Lucas no es ese tipo de director. El creador de Star Wars no es un buen director de actores, y el problema es que tampoco sabemos si realmente es un mal director de actores. ¿Por qué? Porque nunca hace nada. Es un observador de la interpretación, no interviene. Deja a talentos en bruto como McGregor y Portman a la deriva en un set que posee no muchos estímulos con los que interactuar. No sólo no da instrucciones, los deja solos en un trabajo que era increíblemente difícil de manejar en esa época: el CGI. El estar frente a una pantalla verde hablándole a nada. La irresponsabilidad de Lucas con sus actores es simplemente otro de los factores que nos entregan a un Obi-Wan Kenobi que no sabe entregar sus líneas, y a una Padmé Amidala que no maneja sus expresiones ni su tono de voz, y sobretodo a un Anakin que es inaguantable y nada carismático.

Anakin... El joven Darth Vader. En este film se supone que empezamos a conocer la historia que llevó al joven Anakin Skywalker, la promesa del Lado Luminoso de la Fuerza, a convertirse al Lado Oscuro como el despiadado y cruel Sith bajo el mando del Emperador. Es muy joven. Es demasiado joven para inspirar una historia lo suficientemente sustentable como para justificar un lento descenso en su camino hacia la oscuridad. El personaje, al igual que la mayoría de los guiones de las precuelas, está simplemente mal escrito. No hay ningún sentido de motivación, ningún sentido de consistencia, ningún sentido y punto, en realidad. Eso, añadido a la actuación cruda de Jake Lloyd, hacen de la historia que todos queríamos ver algo muy, muy decepcionante.

En la historia, una vez que salimos del planeta Tatooine y llegamos a Coruscant, tenemos vistazos reales de Palpatine y del famoso Consejo Jedi. Emocionantes escenas llenas de toda la acción que uno siempre quiere ver: gente sentada y hablando. Sin. Parar. Más política y discusiones aburridas. Afortunadamente, ésta vez es porque precede al clímax, el cual, contra toda expectativa, es espectacular.

Una vez que aparece el sith Darth Maul, la película realmente se pone emocionante. Dejemos de lado la travesía de la Reina Amidala y sus guardaespaldas y la batalla en el espacio que es una mera copia de Una Nueva Esperanza, y enfoquémonos en el duelo de sables de luz de Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan y Darth Maul. Dios, sí que estas secuencias son impresionantes. Dejemos esto en claro, no sólo ésta pelea final es espectacular para esta basura de película, es espectacular en general, en el cine, en la historia. Tomando la misma inspiración que en los duelos de las películas originales, de la película Las Aventuras de Robin Hood con Errol Flynn, la coreografía y la música dramática se mezclan con majestuosidad para crear absoluta perfección cinematográfica. Con movimientos elegantes y fluidos que hacen casi un baile del enfrentamiento, y con la poderosa y dramática pieza Duel of the Fates compuesta por el brillante John Williams, Lucas hace de la culminación del tercer acto algo simplemente genial. Y confirma nuevamente para qué es realmente bueno. Las tomas visuales, innovadoras.

Espero que esta crítica haya sido menos aburrida que el film en sí. Y con la motivación de que ya queda poco para El Despertar de la Fuerza es que me preparo para escribir la siguiente, El Ataque de los Clones, la cual es horriblemente peor... Ugh..."
"Dec 13, 2015",3,"Two words, Jar Jar.

But the Lightsaber battle was epic."
"Dec 13, 2015",2.5,It's long and boring with bad acting
"Dec 13, 2015",4,I still think this is great. haters gonna hate :p
"Dec 13, 2015",2,"WHAT I LIKED: A prequel to the amazing Star Wars trilogy stands out mainly for it's spectacular final action scene, aided by the new-found modern effects. 'The Phantom Menace' succeeds in the bare bones of it's plot too - and it does credit the originals thanks to the score and production design.
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: It was just delivered very badly: it takes ages to get going for a start, and then when you're into the meat of the story it gets bogged down with confusing politics that overwhelm any character development. This clearly isn't helped by the largely dull, monotone acting, plus some of the characters themselves are cringey and laughable too. All this means this is undoubtedly the worst Star Wars adventure of all.
VERDICT: This is a dull film throughout that only gets exciting in the last 20 minutes - sadly a poor effort from Lucas that fails to capture his success with the originals."
"Dec 12, 2015",2.5,"It's boring but hey, at least it looks cool."
"Dec 12, 2015",3,Jar-jar binks is just the worst.
"Dec 12, 2015",2.5,"_REWATCH REVIEW_
I saw this movie a very long time ago and I only remember parts of it and with Episode VII coming out this month, I just had to rewatch all of the previous episodes. I honestly don't remember this one being so bad... The story introduces us to Anakin Skywalker (AKA Darth Vader) when he was just a kid and his path on becoming a jedi. The story also has some seriously uninteresting parts with the Trade Federation and awful comic relief with Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar Binks is the worst character in this movie. Every scene with him trying to be funny is cringe-worthy and beyond annoying. There are also scenes where the comic relief doesn't fit in at all! There's a scene where the Gungans and clones are fighting and it's all supposed to be epic, but then there's Jar Jar Binks being clumsy and basically screwing everything up! That's not funny! That's annoying! I was very mad at a few scenes where he just ruined an otherwise good scene... Also, speaking of characters, Anakin Skywalker's actor is horrible. I'm sure there were better kid actors back then. Jake Lloyd did not deliver, and neither did other kid actors on Tatooine who were just plain awful. The CGI is also painfuly obvious, but I'm willing to let that go by as it was made in 1999. Now, back to the story. Darth Maul is very underused for a character that was supposed to be a threat to the universe. He's in the movie for like 6-10 minutes total! The ending lightsaber duel is sometimes good, but I found it hilarious how fast Obi-Wan got rid of him. The direction was okay, but the transition between scenes was sometimes weird. There're times when a scene ends and another one starts, but then in about 20 seconds, another scene starts with the same transition all over again. It's quite distracting. All in all, I think that this is the worst Star Wars episode with a few good parts (the podrace was great) and a lot of not as good (bad) parts, awkward and cringe-worthy acting and, of course, the godawful Jar Jar Binks. I can't not recommend watching this movie as it's the first episode in the series and that's the only reason I recommend it."
"Dec 11, 2015",3,"Though some of the casting choices and over-use of CGI are burdensome, The Phantom Menace still has an interesting story to tell with dazzling action set pieces."
"Dec 11, 2015",2,"Journey to Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens 
Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace - Movie Review
A Phantom Menace is a victim of poor directing/writing on Lucas's part. Rather than providing an introduction to the Star Wars saga, the film drops you into the middle of a conflict that's not properly unfolded(hence the long intro to the movie), and revolves around a battle that, while a good story on its own, has nothing to do with the Star Wars films we know and love.

This is particularly disappointing because what else there is in the movie is really quite good. The whole background of Anakin Skywalker is excellent (the future Darth Vader starting out as a slave boy on a remote planet is brilliance), and his introduction to the Jedi Council is a bittersweet moment seasoned with dramatic irony. There is also the introduction of the Sith, Coruscant, the Senate and, of course, the Jedi, which are mentioned or referred to numerous times in the original trilogy, but never fully revealed.

The special effects, while impressive, are only a taste of what will come in the next two prequels: incredible abuse of the CGI technology Lucas has at his fingertips. Nevertheless, the space battles are akin to what we're familiar with, the pod racing is an instant classic, and the lightsaber duels are breathtaking.

In spite of the high points of the film, The Phantom Menace is a real disappointment. It's a clunky ""introduction"" that is odd compared to the original trilogy no matter how you look at it, littered with cheesy lines, bad costumes, bad directing, things thrown in only for nostalgia's sake (C-3P0 really should not have been in this movie), contradictions to the original films, and of course, Jar-Jar. But Gungans or no Gungans, this film can only be seen as bitter medicine that must be swallowed by Star Wars fans. Fortunately, the prequels get slightly better as they go on, but they still stand best as a separate trilogy, no matter how desperately Lucas tries to tie the two together."

6.5

""And so it began, with a fun breath of air"""
"Dec 11, 2015",2.5,"""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" is an okay Sci-fi film of 1999. The plot to the movie is that ""Qui-Gon Jinn"" and ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" are sent to settle the matter of ""Trade Federation"" cutting off support to Naboo. The plot is dull and boring when compared to the original trilogy. The acting in this film is bad, the actors except for Liam Neeson, are all talking with no expression. ""Anakin Skywalker"" and ""Jar Jar Binks"" are the most annoying characters I have ever seen in a movie. ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" has got horrible special effects, the ""Computer Generated Images"" are very noticeable, which is not a good thing. The music in this film is pretty good, the music is most likely the best part of the film. Another thing I enjoyed about this film was how it was filmed, ""George Lucas"" usually does a good job at filming movies and ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" is no exception. I give ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" a 5/10."
"Dec 10, 2015",5,A visual masterpiece.
"Dec 10, 2015",0.5,"Amateur-level writing and robotic acting together with a nonsensical plot make this an emotionally hollow experience, with the only redeeming quality being the visuals."
"Dec 09, 2015",4,"I have fond memories of when it was released and it has a feel-good quality to it underneath it all which is important in Star Wars....I think it's a fine movie, with some great parts that you will actually remember, unlike Episode 2 which has almost no story or memorable scenes in it (apart from yoda and perhaps one battle scene). Episode 3 is of course also very good."
"Dec 07, 2015",4,"Not nearly as awful as people say it is. One of the first movies I saw in theaters so it holds a special place for me which causes me to enjoy it even at 21. However, I do all the serious issues with and understand why people don't like it but does not ruin my enjoyment of it. Even though most of my enjoyment is through nostalgia"
"Dec 07, 2015",3.5,"Expectations were high and met with obvious disappointment... but on re-watch this is still the most likeable of the 3 prequels. I think the kid is pretty good. Obviously Jar Jar is the worst, but the Gungans &amp; their underwater city are interesting and visually appealing. So is the pod-racing, the Senate's Grand Chamber &amp; repulsorpods, and the battle with the droid army. Thankfully the DVD version I own still has muppet Yoda, and not the terrible digital version inserted and re-released later."
"Dec 06, 2015",2.5,"This prequel is by far the most boring in the saga, throwing uninteresting characters into situations that feel less ambitious than the other films. (C-)"
"Dec 06, 2015",2,"A laughable script with hollow dialogue, flat humor, baffling political lingo (this is supposed to appeal to a younger audience right?) and terrible one liners (""There's always a bigger fish"") squanders a talented cast and tarnishes what is otherwise an action-packed, visually stunning entry in the saga we all know and love."
"Dec 05, 2015",2.5,"Gravi problemi di coerenza narrativa ed ideologica sono presenti nel momento in cui scene assolutamente infantili vengono inserite in un contesto politico poco snello e non di facile comprensione. Non si ha ben chiaro il pubblico di destinazione e si finisce con un film poco incisivo sotto ogni punto di vista, dagli aspetti tecnici a quelli narrativi. Il modo peggiore per cominciare un'altra trilogia di questa immensa saga cinematografica."
"Dec 04, 2015",2.5,"Too much jar jar binks for me. Truly only for hardcore fans of the franchise. Otherwise, it's just bland."
"Dec 02, 2015",3,"So like everybody that saw this film, I was excited to see the new trilogies first installment. Once I saw the opening crawl I knew something was up when it included boring stuff. Even though i ended up liking the film, i was still dissipointed."
"Dec 02, 2015",3,Well.  I just watched it for the second time.  The sequence where we meet Anakin and he races the speedster is really good!  But Jar Jar Binks was so distracting.  And the rest of the movie was meh.  I actually didn't remember any of the movie prior to meeting Anakin.
"Dec 02, 2015",2.5,"The Phantom Menace is packed with impressive heart-pounding action scenes that still hold up surprisingly well after 16 years. However, it's all but muted by a story that neither needed to be told nor is good enough to justify itself."
"Dec 02, 2015",3,Episode One is by no means the strongest in the franchise but seeing as its meant to be where it all began its best to go at it with a clear mind. On the whole its a pretty stunning visual affair even if there are some weak performances. Theres plenty of variety in the action too along with some laughs to be had whilst the story isnt at its darkest. This movie has the character to appeal to all audiences and will remain part of a great franchise.
"Dec 02, 2015",2.5,"The fervor with which this film is so often derided is relatively embarrassing, frankly, the work a punching-bag for so-called loyalists intent on proving their incredibly noble allegiance to what allegedly makes the series great by panning it as a failure on every level; to put it mildly, this passionate scorn is ridiculous. The Phantom Menace is the worst of the series, and yet it still manages to work as a piece of light entertainment given the expansive visuals and the compelling action sequences, a work of astounding scope and imagination that glides by on the strength of its visual impact.

Yes, the plot is predicated upon seemingly divine coincidences, but this criticism is rendered null and void when the inclusion of the divine is made evident, the Force a means of explaining why what happens plays out in such an easy way. Yes, there are severe missteps that nearly tank the thing (of course, the infamous Jar Jar Binks and his moronic bumbling remains a nightmare) and the length is unforgivingly bloated; all this aside, it's not the abomination that so many fans would have you believe.

As a bonafide hardcore fan who grew up watching the original trilogy hundreds of times, who dressed up as Darth Vader for Halloween for several years, who's known around the house for his adolescent propensity for demanding an adult ""put Darth Vader's lightsaber back in his hand"" when it wouldn't stay attached to his action figure, I can honestly say that this movie isn't affront to my formative years. It's a disappointment, but it is objectively passable as a piece of filmmaking. There is fun to be had here, even if it's frequently offset with childish nonsense and CGI fish people."
"Dec 02, 2015",3,"Looks like someone didn't go back and edit the action scenes at the end of movie of Darth Maul vs. the Jedi. I didn't think Jar Jar was that bad, I thought  he was entertaining."
"Dec 01, 2015",3,"Si se hubiera empezado a filmar Star Wars desde el episodio 1, esto hubiese sido una porquería."
"Nov 30, 2015",2,"Biggest disappointment of all time. The dialogue and acting are awful, the characters are underdeveloped. But I think it does have a few redeeming moments."
"Nov 30, 2015",2,"Me parece la peor de la saga por ser tan insulsa y poco llamativa, además de que tiene sus momentos aburridos, lo unico bueno de esta es la batalla contra Darth Maul no más aunque creo que fue corta y no tuvo tanta participación."
"Nov 29, 2015",4,I personally love the the phantom menace. I think the visuals are amazing especially the podrace sequence and the battle between the gunguns and the droid army. The light saber battle is far superior from that of the original trilogy. On the other hand I did find jar to be a bit annoying and the acting to be a little stiff. Overall great movie that tends to be underrated .
"Nov 29, 2015",2,"Ewan McGregor is sexy so things are off to a good start. I couldn't understand a single word that Jar Jar Binks said. Wait, so this teenage girl wants to hook up with this tiny loud-mouthed baby child? Wait. Darth Vader built C-3PO? This is stupid. DARTH VADER IS LIKE JESUS??? Who cares about all of this racing crap??? The red face guy kills Qui-Gon Jinn. The child gets a haircut. Even though they presumably had better technology when this movie was made, the story and ideas are pretty dumb."
"Nov 29, 2015",0.5,the worst movie i have ever seen
"Nov 29, 2015",3,This was worse than I remembered. The pacing is all over the place and there are some very cringe worthy lines delivered by a some very cring worthy actors. Also why did the kill off the one of the coolest jedi and one of the coolest sith? C'mon George
"Nov 29, 2015",2,"REWATCH. The first problem I had with this is the running time. It could have been trimmed by at least 20 minutes. The second problem I had was with some of the castings. Jake Lloyd is really annoying as Anakin Skywalker and McGregor is terrible as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Not jumping on the bandwagon or hate train but my main problem though is Jar Jar Binks. Arguably the most annoying character in the history of cinema.  If Binks was created to appeal to younger viewers then why did Lucas's have a complicated plot involving Trade Embargoes? There is some really good stuff in this though. It is great to see Master Yoda and Jabba again, Samuel L. Jackson looks the part, both Neeson and Sebulba are the balls, Darth Maul is an excellent bad guy and a right Demonic looking cunt. The pod racing, the underwater sequence, and that final threesome duel are outstanding."
"Nov 28, 2015",3,"Star Wars fans will kill me, but I have never seen the full set. Today I started with the Phantom Menace which I may say contained a good steady story. My only beef is the acting. it is missing a ton of emotion! There was no feeling in Anakin's departure leaving his mother. He left his FREAKIN MOTHER! I felt other scenes are this way, un sentimental, and hardly no feeling in a drama part when needed. The story is there, acting could have had more to it. Now on to the next one!"
"Nov 27, 2015",0.5,"It's a movie I've given second, third, fourth... dozens of chances, and it somehow manages to be worse every time. I'm not even exaggerating for effect, I always think to myself, ""It wasn't as bad as I thought"", so I'll watch it, and it's worse. I've seen Eks vs. Sever, and this is just as bad."
"Nov 27, 2015",3.5,"Loved the film, however would've rated higher if Darth Maul was in it more than Jar Jar Binks!"
"Nov 26, 2015",2,There's worse movies
"Nov 26, 2015",3,"Man, this is gonna be a hard one to talk about.

I will admit that this was my first Star Wars film growing up, and as such I don' t seem to hate this film as much as others do, But I can understand this is one of the most flawed films ever made in terms of writing and character development.

Let's get the postives out of the way first. John Williams as usual does an amazing job with the score, with Duel of the Fates being one of the best peices i've ever heard in a film, the visual effects, while dated in some areas such as a majority of the alien characters, are really impressive in terms of world design such as the unwatercity of Naboo, a return trip to Tatooine with an epic Podrace scene to go with it, and the Blade-Runner inspired city planet of Corasaunt. The final duel between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon and Obi Wan is also really intense with the most dymanic lightsaber action seen at the time.

Now let's get to what people hate about this film. The plot itself and a majority of the charaacters. Although Ewan Macgregor tries his best at his way too short -screen time, I don't like how Luca's undermined his role in Anakin being chosen to become a Jedi, by having him overturned by Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon, which causes numorouus ccontiuty errors with the orignal trilogy as it was clearly stated that Yoda trained Obi-Wan and Obi was the one who chose Anakin to become a Jedi.

Natalie Portman gives one of the worst preformances in her career as the monotone Queen Amidala, Both Ray Park's Darth Maul and the returing C-3PO and R2-D2 don't get engough screentime to make them memorable and Don't even get me started on one of the worst comic relifs in history. Shame about Jake Lloyd though, he didn't desrve all the bulling he's gotten over the years due to Luca's completely srewing him over in the scriptwriting.

Overall The Phantom Menace does has some entertaing moments and an inreblie score,  but it ultimately falls flat from over-high expectations and Luca's poor writing skills."
"Nov 26, 2015",3,"Unoriginal characters, an uneven plot, and the introduction of the infamous Jar-Jar Binks, ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" demonstrates that the Star Wars franchise may have become overextended, despite the visual appeal that this film has to offer."
"Nov 26, 2015",3.5,"Yes the movie is not good, but look at the bright side. It had no Hayden Christensen. The thing I really enjoy about The Phantom Menace is the pot-racing, Liam Neesons acting, and of course Darth Maul. The whole thing with JarJars folk and the final, let's call it 'battle' is so goddamn boring though. Let's just say, without this movie, we would not have the Duel of the Fates."
"Nov 26, 2015",5,Vraiment génial après la passion pour les premiers celui là est reçu comme une bombe!
"Nov 25, 2015",0.5,Watch Mr. Plinkett's (Red Letter Media) masterful review and then you (and not just your brain) will know how bad this movie is.
"Nov 23, 2015",5,"People always complain about theesa movie. What yousa never knew is that Jar Jar is a Sith Lord! Seriously, watch the entire film with the idea that Jar Jar is a Sith Lord manipulating Palpatine. I think the idea was that Jar Jar was meant to be the ""Yoda"" of the Dark Side but rather than revealing him in the first film he was to be revealed in the second. People hated him so much that the idea was scrapped and Count Dooku was used to replace Jar Jar because they didn't think a reveal would be taken well by the audience because he was so hated.

So basically this movie is the best film ever made."
"Nov 23, 2015",3.5,It was okay . I was expecting it to be quite bad .
"Nov 23, 2015",2,"Though not as bad as many say, the film still fails to maintain the same charm as any of the original 3 films while repeating the same sort of story arc."
"Nov 22, 2015",1,At least it had Darth Maul
"Nov 22, 2015",4,"Loved this! Ja ja binks is my favourite, so funny."
"Nov 21, 2015",3.5,"A quality romp to bring us back to the start of the saga. Overly convoluted plot doesn't take away from the fun, hamminess and 'star wars' feeling of it all. A bit less 'yippee' than expected."
"Nov 21, 2015",4.5,"An interesting take on the Beginning of the saga.  Not what I expected.  Like the idea of getting a different side of a galaxy far, far,  away"
"Nov 19, 2015",3,"The Phantom Menace is an above average movie. It's a fairly typical 90's family adventure movie and while some of the editing is a bit dodgy, I'd hardly call it a bad movie. However, it doesn't feel like a Star Wars film. It's certainly trying to be Star Wars, with scenes like the space battle echoing parts of the original trilogy, but the characters struggle to be anywhere near as memorable as the likes of Han Solo. 

It's also trying very hard to aim itself at a younger audience (although sparse action bored me as a kid), with characters like Jar Jar and the young Anakin. Even in Return of the Jedi, the Ewoks were criticized for being out of place in an otherwise adult-friendly trilogy, so why similar characters were brought into this film is baffling when most of the returning audience would be in their 30's or older at release. If you can overlook the kids' elements it's actually alright, especially when they were using real sets and props rather than CGI mockups."
"Nov 18, 2015",0.5,"portentous science-fiction tale, both dramatically and visually. but underwhelming, inchoate leads and political babble lend the film a petty inconsequentiality. the hollow script especially spells a startling vicissitude for cinema's most inviting franchise. it's externally theatrical, like the podrace, yet lacks human intimacy."
"Nov 18, 2015",3.5,"I can remember going to the theaters to see this movie multiple times and all the hype surrounding it opening week. Many fans praised it at the time but have since gone back and trashed it. I rematched it recently on bluray and while the movie has some faults it has a lot of positive things too.
The opening with Qui-gon Jinn and Obi-wan Kenobi is quite good. Our first look at some truly powerful Jedi and some new interesting droids. When Qui-gon is pushing his lightsaber into the blast doors and they are falling you can really tell the trade federation leaders are scared.
Once Qui-gon and Obi-wan end up on Naboo with the trade federation droid army and everyones favorite character Jar-Jar Binks then things start to get a little cheesy. I do get all the hate for Jar-Jar. He is a silly character ... but think about it people ... is Jar-Jar really meant for adults. As I was watching this with my 10 year old daughter who later told me her favorite character from the first movie was indeed Jar-Jar ... i noticed that everytime he did something silly and made funny noises she laughed. Jar-Jar is meant to be a goofy side character for children. If you look at him like that ... he really isn't that bad. Do we spend a little too much time with him ... sure. A problem that is fixed in later movies. Once we get through the Gungan city scenes we see Qui-gon and Obi-wan rescue Queen Amidala. This is a pretty cool scene and during the escape their ship is damaged and they must take refuge on Tatooine. Here we meet young Anakin Skywalker. Many hate on this child actor as well but I really don't think he is that bad. He is a kid and good child actors are hard to find but he does a serviceable job. Sure he has some corny dialogue but that is not really his fault. We soon get one of my favorite things from the movie ... the pod race. Everything about it is pretty awesome. The different designed pod racers, the different species that pilot them, the sounds the make. Its an awesome scene.
After Anakin wins the race and is freed we head to Coruscant where we get into some politics. Many hate on these scenes because they are supposedly boring and not Star Wars but I find them interesting and you get an early look at what the Emperor is planning. Our final scenes include a battle outside of Naboo with the Gungans and Droids, an awesome lightsaber fight between Darth Maul, Obi-wan, and Qui-gon, and a scene where Anakin joins the fighters to take down the trade federation droid control ship. The Gungan droid battle is okay but the visuals are dated now and there is a little too much Jar-Jar silliness to take it seriously. The lightsaber fight is epic and I can remember being blown away in the theaters the first time watching it. The score by John Williams ""Dual of the Fates"" still one of the best scores for any movie ever. Anakin taking down the droid control ship accidental is pretty silly but I can see what Lucas was going for here and I didn't hate it.
Overall there are some things like about The Phantom Menace. My biggest complaint is the fact that most of the movie doesn't have much significance with the other films in the saga. I can get passed the silliness of Jar-Jar and the weird dialogue and honestly say I enjoy this movie. Is it perfection ... no ... but is it complete garbage not worthy of the Star Wars name ... no!"
"Nov 18, 2015",3.5,3.5 stars because Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson are in it together. Natalie Portman's accent is super weird...
"Nov 15, 2015",2,"Aside from the fact that these Stars Wars prequels shouldn't exist, they're bad in their own way, the characters and lines are wretched, but you've heard others say that before. What really murders these movies, for me, is the CGI. It's off putting and WRONG. And these characters are also wrong. There's Jar Jar, who you know about, but then there's the young Anakin, who makes me want to jump. Darth Maul is a good character, but everything else is.... Shit."
"Nov 13, 2015",5,"Gotta look at in as just a movie filling in the gaps because 4,5,6 was outstanding!"
"Nov 07, 2015",2.5,"An candy shop of visuals and lightsaber fights which is too easily consumed leaving a sick feeling of dry characters and the most tedious dialogue known to man. Jar Jar Binks you worthless excuse for comic relief. But, the visuals of battle are always nice to see and the pod race was surprisingly intense...and you can appreciate how cheesy it is for that extra burst that doesn't make this movie complete garbage along with some added nostalgia."
"Nov 07, 2015",2,"3 words, Jar Jar Binks"
"Nov 04, 2015",1.5,"Completely lacking on anything that made the originals good, Phantom Menace is an awful disappointment.
C-"
"Nov 01, 2015",2,"Star Wars has a few fun moments, with the rest being dull, and uninteresting."
"Nov 01, 2015",2,The only two good scenes in this movie are so far apart that the whole movie feels like a waste.
"Nov 01, 2015",3.5,"Rating: 7/10

The last Star Wars movie I've seen 6 years ago where the ones of the OT. I haven't watched The Phantom Menace for 8 years and I've watched it only twice, while I've watched Revenge of the Sith and OT movies 3 to 4 times. The first time I've watched The Phantom Menace was 10 years ago, after viewing Revenge of the Sith on cinema when I was almost 16 years old. Having watched it as an adult now (I'm now 25) after all those years has confirmed to me something that I've always thought: this movie is not as bad and catastrophic as his reputation indicates it and it is being severely underrated and a large part of the critics against this movie are grotesquely exaggerated.

Yes, I've also find its narrative structure to be a little bit wobbly on some parts and it is also very slow-paced. But I think that this movie still holds up pretty well as a small regular sci-fi movie, well at least for new-viewers or Star Wars virgins. It's not a masterpiece as the original Star Wars from 1977, I'll give the critics that, but it's not a bad movie either. I rather think that it's a movie that you might watch on a Friday or Saturday evening just to chill down after a very busy week with your studies or work.

Despite a new viewing of this movie after all those years, it still is not my favorite Star Wars movie. But there are some moments and parts in it that have grown inside of me and others that I've found more relevant or important like the story of Anakin being freed from a life of slavery and the political plot which I've found confusing when I first viewed the movie as a teenager. But as an adult now, and after having followed a lot of news about politics, especially after I got the right to vote when I was 18, I get the idea behind the plot and all the political machination (these days I have a more cynical view about politics since I've found many of our leaders to be not inspiring or without any determination).

Ian McDiarmid certainly plays a great charmer and manipulator in this movie as senator Palpatine and this movie indicates us that he's character who requires our attention. Padme's character in this movie has grown in me a little more than the first time I've viewed the movie since she has demonstrated that she can be a leader with an authoritarian side but also a very gentle one. I liked pretty much Qui-Gon's character. I liked almost every scene between Shmi and Qui-Gon and between Anakin and him. What those scenes has revealed to me is that Qui-Gon would have been a better choice as a Jedi Master to train Anakin and maybe prevent his fall to the Dark Side later on, since he seemed to be more understandable towards Anakin's situation while being a slave and be separated from his mother.

I will give critics credits to the fact that in this movie there's no main character. But I rather think that this impression comes from the fact that many were expecting Anakin to be the main character, at least it was one of my expectations when I first viewed the movie. But now it seems clear to me that Qui-Gon and Padme have the lead role in this movie since they are the ones taking the most important decision in the story until the torch is being transferred to Obi-Wan after Qui-Gon's funeral.

Concerning the most criticized aspects of this movie like the CGI, Jar Jar or midichlorians, I will get into it.

The CGI and special effects in this movie seem to hold up pretty well for the most part even when watching it on 1080p screen and on Blu-Ray.

Concerning Jar Jar, well the only part I've found him to occupy too much time and was too distracting was during the ground battle on Naboo with the droid army, since it is supposed to be an action sequence. He was really over the top in that sequence. I didn't really let myself to be distracted by him on the other scenes.

About midichlorians, I still don't see how it destroys the concept of the Force. It's not said that the Force is composed of biological organism. It is simply explained that those micro-organisms allow people to communicate with the Force and use it and they are living within every people, thus allowing life to exist and everyone to use the Force. But even if everyone can use the Force, only the Jedi know how to manipulate and control it. It didn't destroy the mythology of the Force itself but I rather think that it has added a more mystical aspect when saying that there are small organisms living within every being in the galaxy allowing life to exist (not to confuse with allowing the Force to exist) and people to use and communicate with the Force.

To conclude, I think that two main arguments against this movie could be easily discarded: the first one is that only children should like or appreciate it. I'm in mid-twenties and I still appreciate it, but it doesn't mean that I think it is a great Star Wars movie, it's an average one. The second one is that nothing happens in this movie, an argument that many people should drop because in a movie, there's rarely nothing that happens. I think that this movie, as a prologue to the main story told in the Episodic movies works pretty well, but his main negative aspect is that it's a very slow-paced movie and it can easily loose the attention from the audience.

Since I've found some new things to appreciate in my new viewing in years, I will give The Phantom Menace a rating of 7/10"
"Oct 30, 2015",1.5,revendo a série 1: muito ruim!
"Oct 29, 2015",2.5,"I grew up with original trilogy. I really like these movies as a kid. Now I don't know why... the movie has redemptive qualities with great light sabers duels and... that's it. It's disappointing to see what was made of this franchise, and how it was seemingly disrespected by its original creator.. talk about crazy."
"Oct 28, 2015",2.5,"Going to re-watch them all in episode order in advance of VII coming out in December. I have to say I was glad to get this one out of the way as it's my least favourite (IV, V, VI, III, II then I).

Aside from a good baddy (Darth Maul) who is under used, there isn't much else to recommend about this episode. The only other thing is the knowledge of how some of these characters are going to develop as the saga continues and some nice moments that make more sense when you consider them in the context of events to come.

The pod race was impressive in it's day but is looks average today (it is 16 years later to be fair).

Anyway onto episode II which, from memory based on the once I've already seen it, is a step in the right direction (although not a leap)."
"Oct 27, 2015",3,"I enjoy this film even if I see it's flaws nowadays. However when Star Wars isn't as good it's still Star Wars, and I still have fondness for it. The acting is not always the greatest and the characters could be stronger, however since I grew  up with all six films and not just the first three, I am able to remember what made me love this movie the first time I saw it."
"Oct 27, 2015",4,Pretty Good movie! only real problem is Jar Jar Binks but even then he didn't really  bother me that much!
"Oct 25, 2015",2.5,"The thing I like most:
1. The  lightsaber combat between Obi Wan and Darth Maul

The things I dislike most: 
1. The waste of screen time with Jar Jar Bink
2. Darth Maul character is underdeveloped
3. The podrace is unnecessarily long"
"Oct 24, 2015",3,E comeÃ§a a maratona atÃ© o dia 17 de dezembro.
"Oct 22, 2015",3,"Not the greatest Star Wars film by all means , but a still enjoyable movie non the less. The acting is wooden , the script is flat for the most part but enjoyable and fun characters for the most part. JAR JAR BINX what was Lucas thinking !!!."
"Oct 21, 2015",2.5,"Not as bad as it is made out to be. It features terrible acting and dialogue, but it continues on the world building of the previous films and a great John Williams score."
"Oct 21, 2015",2.5,"The Phantom Menace came out when i was very little so my heart was not ripped to pieces when i saw it for the first time. I actually used to like this film when i was younger, it wasn't until i was a teenager that i saw this film for what it was, a pile of crap. there are certainly some redeeming qualities to the Phantom Menace like the pod race and the Darth Maul fight. (although the choreography to that fight is so obvious that it does bother me a little bit). the idea of trade negotiations could have been good if George Lucas was not directing. the execution was terrible, people sitting in rooms talking is not what star wars is about and it ruined the movie. do not get me started on Jar Jar Binks, his lack of presence in the next two movies was a smart move by Lucas. Overall this is the worst Star wars movie in my opinion. 2.3/5"
"Oct 20, 2015",3.5,"Extremely far off from being as much of a timeless classic as the three original films, but nowhere near as bad as some of the criticisms may suggest. The first chapter of the prequel trilogy remains the most underrated of the entire franchise. Its main flaws come from the infamously annoying CGI character, a lack of backstory for the flashy antagonist, and a few silly moments and narrative points. But when the film does work, it works extremely well, and the good does indeed outweigh the bad. The performances from Neeson and McGreggor are very good, the visuals are as breakthrough for its time as the 1977 original's were, and John Williams' score is as magnificent as ever (especially in the ""Duel of Fates"" sequence). It also has thrilling and dazzling action, particularly in the pod-race scene and the epic lightsaber duel in its climax."
"Oct 17, 2015",2,The first Star Wars film released in my life time and I remember being genuinely excited when it was first released. On seeing it again and being unable to view the film without thinking of the backlash it receives to this day I have to say that the film is much worse than I remember. Several characters are outdated racial stereotypes and there are a lot of boring scenes surrounding a trade federation. The dialogue does not fair much better and Anakin is highly annoying. There are some decent action scenes especially when Darth Maul  is involved and the Pod racer scene is not awful. The reliance on CGI instead of practical effects is another huge negative and there are huge swathes of the film where the actors are the only real thing in shot. Hopefully The Force Awakens is a better start to the new trilogy.
"Oct 17, 2015",3.5,Alright Film Some Light Saber Battles Were Pretty Cool Choreographed Very Well
"Oct 12, 2015",3,Needs more Phantom Menace and less Jar Jar Binks.
"Oct 10, 2015",3.5,"The ok Star Wars movie yet to come. but I still think it's pretty enjoyable with the Pod Racing and the Lightsaber fight at the end, amazing"
"Oct 07, 2015",2.5,Jar Jar was much more annoying than I remembered.
"Oct 06, 2015",1.5,This movie was such a let down
"Oct 06, 2015",5,"When it came to one of the most anticipated movies ever, this one did not disappoint so good saw it four times at the theater when it was out. Jar Jar Binks gets a bad rap by some fans but I'm not gonna put the movie down because of him. My only fault it that Yoda didn't look like himself, it took the films release on Blu-Ray to correct that. See this movie if you get a hold of it also, because the saga is not complete without it."
"Oct 04, 2015",2.5,"I'm afraid that I haven't seen any Star Wars film up until recently (aside from The Clone Wars TV Series), and I was excited that the Star Wars films was finally airing on Australian TV. Unfortunately, it was Episode I: The Phantom Menace that would be aired first, the one that was almost unanimously panned by the fanboy community.

However, while I don't think it's as terrible as the fanboys are saying it it, it's certainly not good either. I actually think most of the performances were decent, with the exception of Natalie Portman because she was switching from British accent or American. Jake Lloyd as Anakin was fine as far as child actors go, though his acting didn't feel genuine in some places. A lot of the CG really didn't hold up, despite the film having many cool visual sequences. The plot itself I really didn't care for, especially since there is a lot of boring politics talk and some other plot points felt mediocre. As for Jar Jar Binks, he failed at being the wacky sidekick character and was too silly, even for Star Wars.

The Phantom Menace was memorable for both the right and wrong reasons, it just could've been much better if the film was more engaging enough. So far, this first Star Wars experience did not start off well for me."
"Oct 03, 2015",2.5,This much anticipated movie as a prequel to the original trilogy proved to be a major disappointment. It is drab with none of the wit and charm of the originals. The introduction of some new characters also doesn't work well.
"Oct 02, 2015",2.5,Cool lightsaber fights can't save Phantom Menace from Jar Jar Binks and boring characters.
"Sep 26, 2015",3.5,"Darth Maul's scenes were amazing, Duel of the Fates was one of the most epic songs of the saga, and the Duel on Naboo was exciting and well choreographed, but Jar Jar Binks was a huge let down."
"Sep 23, 2015",1.5,"In 1999 they had a puppet for yoda which made it bad
32%"
"Sep 21, 2015",2,"This movie has good visuals with the Naboo world, the Shiny, earth-tone Trade Federation armies, pod racing, and three great new characters: Darth Maul, Mace Windu, and Qui-Gon Jinn. Sadly this was not enough to save this movie from the darkside.
 In The Empire strikes Back, it was explicitly stated that Yoda trained Obi-Wan in the Force, but in this movie Qui-Gon Jinn is the trainer, dismissing the original and authoritative trilogy. The introduction of the Midi-Chlorian concept de-mystified the Force, robbing the prequel film of much of its fantasy element: Darth Maul, the best part of the film, (SPOILER) died too young in the franchise. Jake Loyd is more annoying than Dennis the Menace, and Jar Jar Binks is an insult to the plot. The dialogue is flat and unemotive.
This movie is a fail."
"Sep 21, 2015",2,"its really easy to hate this movie, it ruined one of the greatest trilogies in the world, it introduced us to Jar Jar Binks, it ruined Jake Lloyds career, it has some of hollywood's most memorable faces like Samuel L Jackson and Liam neeson, Its CGI is terrible, it can be steriotypical at times and it's plot and focus is terrible! In my opinion though, it is not the worst movie ever made and I will praise it for
NOTHING
I was just kidding about the praise, I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!1"
"Sep 17, 2015",3,"It's not the worst movie ever, but it's not great either"
"Sep 16, 2015",2.5,"The Phantom Menace is deeply flawed and mostly consists of bad acting, political debates, and annoying characters. However, there are plenty of cool action sequences."
"Sep 14, 2015",1,One of the most disappointing movies ever. Darth Maul was the only good thing in it and that's only because he doesn't talk (and a badass).
"Sep 12, 2015",0.5,"The Phantom Menace is a terrible, boring, long (longer than any of the original films) film, and it's strange that George Lucas could come back from such a great film series with such a piece of crap.  They kill off the two decent characters they introduced and left us with Jar Jar."
"Sep 11, 2015",2,"I worshipped several crappy movies when I was a kid, but Star Wars never really got there with me.  I liked watching it, but quickly moved on.  Then as a teen, I went to see the re-release of the 1st one and just couldn't believe how little it did for me.  Being on a scifi kick again now, I decided to gut my way through the newer ones and this one stuck me as  considerably better than the original and about on par with the two following.  A half-decent bad movie."
"Sep 08, 2015",5,"Terrible choreography with the lightsaber scenes, couldn't get worse from a bunch of first grade ballet students. Anakin's driving in the pod racing scene was like a fifteen year old getting his learners. However everything else in this film was brilliant, I particularly praise Jar Jar Binks as he was the most developed and mature character of all six star trek films."
"Sep 07, 2015",2.5,A giant step backwards in the franchise
"Sep 06, 2015",3.5,"This probably wasn’t the beginning that The fans of the Original Movies were expecting, but it is an ok-ish start to the prequel trilogy.Darth Maul is the MVP of this movie! Liam Neeson is superb as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn"
"Sep 05, 2015",4.5,"This, along with the other 2 are some of the most criminally underrated movies ever!"
"Aug 31, 2015",3.5,7/10 Much more entertaining than the original trilogy in my opinion.
"Aug 31, 2015",1.5,"Tax disputes, trade delegations. Yes it was just as bad as I'd remembered from 1999. The first 30 minutes is deadly dull as Lucas clutters the screen with CGI. The pod race and finale do pick up the pace, but mostly it's wading through mud."
"Aug 28, 2015",1,"Aside from Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor giving great performance, the end fight with Darth Maul is the only part that excited and impressed me."
"Aug 27, 2015",3.5,"The Phantom Menace: Flawed, but not a total disaster

   I am completely aware that this is not the most popular of the star wars films, and of course, is not as good as the originals. That all being said, it doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I'm not going to waste my time trying to outline the many unseen positives of the movie, but instead I'll try and show why I think the general public doesn't like it and the rest of the prequels. 

Firstly, Overuse of CGI. By the time the later 90's rolled around, special effects had become more and more seen in films. Go back a couple decades and look at the original Star Wars movie. The amount of effects in it was unprecedented at the time, and it was noticed because of it. For the Phantom Menace, Lucas wanted to do a similar thing, but now that effects had caught up, with effects heavy films like T2 and Jurassic Park being released earlier that decade, so Lucas would have to do something with more impressive effects than ever before. He did this, and did not dissapoint, except for the most vocal fans, who criticized him for this, and while the cgi does admitably get heavy later on in the trilogy, this one contained the least, and heavy cgi is not a problem until the point where it takes away from the plot, which it didn't. 
George Lucas revolutionized the effects industry, just like he did in the original, but  to the dismay of fans, something I still don't quite understand.

Jar Jar
Branching off of the CGI, George Lucas created a revolutionary character, the first CGI creature to interact with human beings. George created this to be a character nebver seen in star wars, a comedic relief character. He wanted to make the saga more acessible to Children, but the older fans criticized him for being to childish, the purpose he was made for. I simply can't understand how they can complain that star wars, a family movie, is too childish. 

Boring plot
To start, take a look back at the originals, the plot can be explained fairly easily. ""A Boy gets thrust into the galactic war and eventually becomes a hero and turns his father away from the dark side"". With the prequels, Lucas decided to change it up and come up with a new plot, a multi layered, thoughtfull plot. Fans criticized the plot of being boring and filled with useless politics. Though partially true, Lucas was only trying to create something that was realistic, people trying to make sense of a corrupt government, an that governments eventual fall. Though he didn't do it perfect, I was far from horrible. Another plot point that angered fans was Anakin being a child. They complaind it made him seem whiny and boring. I believe that it made him seem innocent, making it even more heartbreaking when he falls to the dark side, becoming the twisted sith lord. In the end, I think fans were far too attached to the originals, and didn't want to see anything that was different, or changed their view. But lucas has to be credited for his originality, creating something entirely different and new, something I have yet to see in the new movie, which sees the same armies from the originals instead of something new.

Bad Acting
Unfortunately, this is why my score is only at a 3 1/2, the acting in this movie, and the other prequels, while still not horrible, just isn't great. Most of this can be brought down to poor scripting. The dialogue in the originals was not perfect either, but it has the edge because George used the help of colleagues, something he tried not to do with this. 

In the end, I believe that this movie could never match the feats of the original, especially not in a world where other cinematic experiences like star wars had come into play. Ep 1 had to do something great, and it tried to, but the fans disagreed. The fans wanted to see something that reminded them of the originals, Lucas didn't do that, but he still created an amazing movie. Had ep 1 repeated the plot of the original beat for beat, would it be popular, if the prequels had be made first, would they still be hated. These questions serve less as a question of George Lucas' talents and more of an insight into the narrow minded fans of star wars, something far mor important to take into acount when criticizing this film."
"Aug 26, 2015",3.5,"Slow moving but essential to the rest of the saga
So just watch it"
"Aug 25, 2015",2.5,Only because of the Duel of the Fates
"Aug 25, 2015",1.5,"Let's be honest, this isn't Star Wars."
"Aug 25, 2015",2.5,"Re-watching this makes me realise how poor it is. If it wasn't for the lightsaber fights it would be worse. 
Fingers crossed for the new Star Wars films."
"Aug 23, 2015",4,"This is my personal favorite of the prequels. I know there is a lot of bureaucracy, Senate and Council meetings, but that is the Republic. Sure there is Jar Jar, but we also get Darth Maul, the pod racing scene and the first well choreographed lightsaber fights in a Star Wars film."
"Aug 22, 2015",2,"It sports more elaborate lightsaber fights and effects over the original trilogy, but this is still a shocking far cry in competence as George Lucas' script cuts most of the story's context in favor of those visuals. There is a promising feel for Anakin's personal story, but it's let down with poor scripting, weak direction, and a gungan only a kid at Anakin's age would love."
"Aug 21, 2015",1.5,"I'll be honest; this movie isn't completely awful, but it is disappointing considering the franchise it came from."
"Aug 20, 2015",1,The Phantom Menace turned Star Wars from a sci-fi action adventure into a boring political drama. The acting is atrocious and the writing is worse.
"Aug 20, 2015",2,Star Wars The Phantom Menace was the most disappointing thing since my son.
"Aug 18, 2015",3.5,"The first (and in my opinion best of the New Trilogy) that still captures some of the Star Wars spirit regardless of a over abundance of CGI.

The story of how Anakin is identified by the Jedi &amp; the wonderful backstory that leads up to the Clone Wars.

I feel this is full of adventure &amp; much more enjoyable than the following two installments. I'm biased since I'm a Star Wars fan but I find the film exciting, vibrant &amp; still engaging."
"Aug 15, 2015",3.5,"Wasn't the best movie in the series, but it does not disappoint."
"Aug 14, 2015",1.5,Jar Jar Binks is trash
"Aug 14, 2015",1.5,The first film of the prequel trilogy sucks.The plot was dumb and because the plot was awfull the try to patch it up with special effects.The plot made no sense because midichlorians; SERIOUSLY;Also in compare to the original trilogy which showed us the try of a small team who wants freedom the prequel trilogy shows us a treat disagrement.HOW LOWER. BUT all of that would be forgiven if it wasn't Jar Jar Bigs.That charcter is awfull with nothing good to offer. Also it is implied tha Watto is in fact a Jewish stereotype. The positive things about the movie were the special effects-with the eception of the awfull CGI-and the actings.
"Aug 12, 2015",2,"Its bearable, but it is full of cringe worthy parts and kind of boring."
"Aug 12, 2015",5,My favorite SW film !
"Aug 11, 2015",2.5,"i can see why people hate this movie, the only thing worth watching is the final battle with Darth maul"
"Aug 10, 2015",2,Too boring to be considered a good movie
"Aug 09, 2015",5,Now that's a best way to start a fabulous prequel trilogy!
"Aug 06, 2015",1.5,"Very much a mixed bag, expectations and reality are always going to struggle following the originals.  Corny and cheesy in too many places, maybe you could argue the original was too - but thing is audiences have grown up since those were made and expect better.  At it's worst, feels like made-for-TV.  Some parts of the film are genuinely good on their own part however, and help raise hope the following episodes are better."
"Aug 05, 2015",2,"Okay, so first off... This is not your ordinary Star Wars movie. This one lacks the advantage of being, well, good. George Lucas had done a great job before, (Episode V being my second favorite movie) but now he has failed. I didn't enjoy this movie, and Jar Jar Banks is so annoying, (as are the rest of the Gungans) and the only thing I like in this movie is Darth Maul. And unfortunately I have to say this movie is on the bad side of my reviews."
"Aug 04, 2015",1,"A boring, pitiful disgrace of a movie"
"Aug 03, 2015",3.5,very Good but hate jar jar binks!!!
"Aug 02, 2015",2,"The biggest disappointment in movie history. The only reason I give this two stars is the song ""Duel of The Fates"" and the light saber fight that goes with it."
"Aug 01, 2015",2.5,"Good 15 minutes start up and ending, but between it a snooze fest."
"Jul 31, 2015",3,Fun but goofy/cheesy movie. Young Anakin and Jar Jar were bad missteps. Stilted acting throughout. Needed more Darth Maul but the end was solid. 
"Jul 28, 2015",3,"4th best installment of the 6 Star Wars films.

Grade = 6/10"
"Jul 27, 2015",3.5,Yeah probably my least favorite Star Wars fil....but not that bad and Darth Maul what a badass. Seriously though i did not like Jar Jar and Anakin.
"Jul 27, 2015",5,good movie for its time showing a cool new look to starwars
"Jul 26, 2015",3,"well, it's entertaining but not as good as episode IV and V"
"Jul 25, 2015",4,I'm one of the few who enjoyed the Star Wars prequels or should I say (love to death) the only thing I'd fix about this film is showing anikan grow up not just have him shown for about a week at most.
"Jul 24, 2015",4,the movie is interesting. generally entertaining. good layout and makeup
"Jul 22, 2015",2.5,Kind of useless to the overall storyline and jar jar is offensive- I did like the pod race a lot though
"Jul 21, 2015",2,"One of the weakest movies in the entire saga, or perhaps the weakest, with only a few parts that really stood out."
"Jul 20, 2015",2,Far cry from what we know as Star Wars
"Jul 18, 2015",1,"Shoddily put together. Bored characters, a plodding plot and no real pace to speak of. Frequently plays less like a film and more like a very dull documentary."
"Jul 17, 2015",2,"Due to kind of a slow moving plot, not the best scripting, and the annoying character of Jar-Jar Binks it turns into a cringe fest."
"Jul 17, 2015",0.5,This film ruined the Star Wars franchise. But I still have hope for The Force Awakens.
"Jul 12, 2015",0.5,WHAT....THE.....HELL.....WAS.......THAT?!
"Jul 09, 2015",3,"While the return of Star Wars was totally worth to wait, this follow-up/prequel lacks the improvement on character development and the underdeveloped plot even though the lightsaber duel sequence with Darth Maul is worth to watch!"
"Jul 06, 2015",3,Awesome short lived villain.
"Jul 05, 2015",2,"An undeniable mess. While the visuals are stunning and inventive, the performances and plot are boring and unnecessary to the saga. Some great action in there, but overall not worth your time even if you are a Star Wars geek like me."
"Jul 03, 2015",0.5,Doesn't match up to the REAL trilogy
"Jul 03, 2015",2,"This is one of the worst Star Wars movies. The acting was quite weak and it was pretty uneven. The special effects were actually pretty decent. Not great, but not terrible. 

The action sequences were pretty good. The pod racing scene and the action with Darth Maul were impressive. Darth Maul was an an awesome character! It's a shame they killed him off. He would've been great in the Attack of the Clones instead of Count Dooku. 

JAR JAR BINKS! WHY?? HES A STUPID CHARACTER WHO REALLY WOULD HAVE MADE THE MOVIE BETTER IF HE WAS NOT IN IT!!!!! 

In conclusion, this movie is pretty bad. But some parts are good, but it just does not have the greatness of the originals."
"Jun 30, 2015",2,"A far cry from the OT, with not much to like except for the score, Darth Maul, Jar Jar (Just kidding) and final lightsaber battle. Overall, it's just a really pointless movie."
"Jun 30, 2015",3,"The Phantom Menace is the first of the newest trilogy in George Lucas' Star Wars franchise. When review the newest of these movies I believe it is best to review them based on their own personal merits, not on their relation to the original trilogy. First I will give my overall opinion and then a couple of specific problems with the movie.
First, the movie is good. Let's establish that first. When I say good I mean good. I don't mean great or fantastic. The action is excellent, if too sparse, and the special effects are tremendous, especially given it's time period. While it might not appeal to people who are not already fans of Star Wars, it should please, even if it doesn't thrill, long time fans.
Now to the problems. First, the film is simply too long. Several scenes simply drag on beyond necessity (Tatooine especially). This creates a bloated movie and leads to the second problem, which is a generally disconnected plot. Several of the events in the movie are significant (new chancellor elected, finding Anakin, disobeying the Jedi council) but we do not feel the weight of these events because they aren't highlighted. The plot doesn't develop in such a way so that we understand and feel the gravity of these actions. This is an even bigger problem when you think of the third problem in the movie which is an over reliance on exposition. With so much talking about midichlorians and the senate you would think we would understand more and care more but we don't. Exposition is fine if it leads to greater emotional connection but in this case it just leads to confusion.
All in all, I give the move 3/5 for it's great set pieces and interesting story even if that story isn't told very well."
"Jun 28, 2015",3,Dialogue and Acting is very dull. Jar Jar is annoying. Not enough Darth Maul. Don't get the hate on young Anakin. And the special effects and score save this movie

"Jun 26, 2015",2,The final fight was beautiful but everything else was sloppy and poorly written. There's no main character and no emotion. Everything went to the special effects and that's why this movie is really bad.

"Jun 15, 2015",2.5,"Full of CGI overload, plot holes, and somewhat sloppy direction, Starwars: The Phantom Menace doesn't quit live up to the Starwars name, but it compensates with a few good action sequences and impressively choreographed lightsaber duels."
"Jun 12, 2015",4,No one is disagreeing that it's easily the weakest in the saga but its not a terrible movie. The level of hate for these prequels is because the name star wars is attached to them. Had they been a different sci fi franchise and not compared to the legendary original trilogy they would probably get much more praise for the things that it does right instead of being incredibly overshadowed by its downfalls. Yet as cringeworthy as some things in this movie are its still a unique movie like no other and i find myself not having any problem watching it as part of the saga.
"Jun 12, 2015",2.5,/sigh. I waited so many years.  Midi-chlorian...wtf?  Darth Maul...awesome choreographed fight. Best I have seen in the Star Wars universe. Thank you Ray Park!!
"Jun 12, 2015",2.5,"Two words to sum up the fall of Star Wars, jar jar. In this action thriller you get to see all the things you wanted to see, like talking, more talking, walking and talking,and sitting and talking. In this movie you promised to see young Anakin Skywalker but now as a annoying brat. I like to mention that the cgi is is getting outdated. Don't even let me start on jar jar. I hate him so annoying, why George Lucas. The best part of the movie though is the Darth Maul secuence and has cool moments an awesome Sith which is sad that he dies at the end. Overall not bad but disappointing"
"Jun 11, 2015",3,"I felt a little disappointed with this one. It had a handful of cringe worthy dialogue delivered  by some cringe worthy acting performances. This also didn't much feel like a Star Wars movie at some points. I also thought a few of the characters were kind of forced and just plain annoying. Don't get me wrong, the movie also had its moments, definitely in the last thirty minutes. I also found that the score to the movie was brilliant and memorable. In the end, this is not a good Star Wars movie but also not a bad one."
"Jun 11, 2015",2,snooze.... Is it over?
"Jun 09, 2015",2,"""I'm a person, and my name is Anakin!"""
"Jun 09, 2015",3.5,I am quite aware of the flaws in phantom menace but I will not unecessrly bash the prequel to make the original triology look better but any way the flaws the movie suffered was miss aimed comic relief and boring diolouge but it can still offer and deliver good and fun moments.
"Jun 07, 2015",4,"There is a part of me that still kinda loves it. Despite some serious problems. Yes, Jar Jar Binks is still pretty annoying (Although by this point, Its not really any fun to hate him anymore.), Little Anakin can't act and his dialogue is overly precious, There are just some things that don't quite work. Also, I don't like Midi-chlorians. Don't like the idea of the force being explained to me. But there is plenty to like. Despite some of the effects being kinda dated. Most of them are still impressive. Liam Neeson is of course, fantastic. Darth Maul is awesome. Full disclosure, I love the Podrace. Love Watto. The lightsaber battle is amazing. Just an amazing scene. Despite some flaws, It does bring more to the lore. Some nice additions. Yeah, If you can get past the Jar Jar. I still think its a good film. Not as great as you want it to be. But still. Love it or hate it, You remember it and have probably seen it more than once."
"Jun 03, 2015",3.5,"The ultimate kids movie. One mistake with the Star Wars prequels, at least the first one; the humor and dialogue is aimed at children, the rest of the film works fairly well for a re-imagining of the Star Wars saga.
There must of been no chance of this film being bad when it was released, I am far to young to remember exactly (I would have been 2 years old when this was released), what everyone was thinking, but I bet they thought there was nothing George Lucas could do to make it a bad film- I mean it has it's own, real-life religion based on it's fictional samurai like faith (Jedi). The movie still gets away with a good rating from me and I was never really a huge-fan of the series/saga, it never had a big impact on me when I watched it when I was kid. But I defiantly liked the original films.

I am currently going through visionary Japaneses director Akira Kurosawa's films- he was one of the inspirations for Lucas's original Star Wars films. Homage to him with his transition from scene to scene with that wipe across thing and Akira's impact on the genre Jidaigeki, which is were he got the word Jedi from. As well as many of its cultural significants like the costumes from Japanese culture (the robes) and the lightsabers, replacing the samurai sword. The More You Know.

In a Galaxy far, far away. Two Jedi's, keepers of peace and justice in the galactic empire are on route to the planet Naboo- they find the Trade Federation are hiding something. They are secretly invading the nearby planet of Naboo. The two Jedi's, Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) save and escort the Queen of Naboo and Padme (Natalie Portman) and her servants to a safer planet Tatooine there they meet young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). The boy seems to be strong in the force. Together all of them must find a way to stop the people of Naboo from being destroyed by the Federation.

With pre-Taken Liam Neeson as a Jedi master with an name that can not be spelled nor spoken by human tongue and Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan, you expect a breakdown of pure brilliance. With the help of the two most lovable droids in cinematic history, the film is not a complete waste of time ( R2D2 &amp; C3-P0) and of course the utterly stunning Natalie Portman.
I am not sure if she is of age in this film so take that statement with a grain of salt.

Jar Jar Binks is annoying, needless to say, but he is not the only thing the now grown-up audience got bat-shit crazy about, a few years later when they came to agree it is not all that was great about there childhood film series. But I think it is healthy to blame it all on one character- it keeps those founders of Jedism sane.
""It was good when your were a kid watching a movie, not so good later when it's a grown-up watching a kids movie.""
- Kevin Smith


A cool idea touched in the film then almost completely ignored. Anakin was born without any consummation, aka no sex- like some kinda of Jesus. For me the George Lucas prequels are each film, George Lucas getting it just right, instead of rehearsing it to perfection, he used each million dollar movie, because each one is better then the next. If you hate special effects infested movies, blame or credit it to this film, Titanic and Jurassic Park. The coolest guy in this film is Darth Maul, a spin-off film would have panned out better then this film did.  Honestly if Lucas had pulled back the CGI, by that I mean none at all. All practical effects, the film would have been just as good his original series, of which he only directed the first, New Hope.

A fine film, simply because of the huge film respect everyone and myself have for the original films. It has it's moments, once on Tatooine and the pod racing. The film had it's mojo back for a few minutes, but then Jar Jar opens his mouth to baby the words of a poor joke with no laughs at all."

This is not a bad beginning. I love the cast. The digital blue ray is amazing. The story begins just fine. I know ja ja binx is not the best but he is ok in this one. I'll give it a 6.5 out of 10"
"May 25, 2015",2.5,"This is a fine example how the spectacle over shadowed the story.  It hit even worse when after years of no new Star Wars, George Lucas gave us this boring political adventure.  Even if there wasn't any Jar Jar Binks, there's little to enjoy in this."

"May 23, 2015",2.5,"Has good action sequences but the Jar-Jar people ruined it, I can't believe this is actually Star Wars, these movies are supposed to be good. 50/100."
"May 23, 2015",3,"While it is definitely the weakest entry in the series, Episode 1 is not as bad as people make it out to be, it effectively introduces important characters to the series whilst slowly bringing in plot elements that are important later in the story and in later episodes.

"May 14, 2015",2.5,"The Phantom Menace has a unfilled plot, the film did not balance how it was supposed to, the film had horrible CGI, and the acting was not very good, and neither was the character development. 

      The Phantom Menace had a lot of unnecessary moments, the Pod Race was a way to get a video game, as said by Jeremy Jahns. Also, a lot of things were most likely put their  to make the run time an hour more than it should have been, if I made the film, I could have made it an hour and a half, heck I even fell asleep during the battle in the end.

       In conclusion, The Phantom Menace has a unfilled plot, with no good character development, or acting, but The Phantom Menace still brings an exiting taste for the franchise, even with it's flaws, it's a good film.

GRADE: 5.7/10"
"May 13, 2015",2.5,50% on my Tomatometer.
"May 13, 2015",1,Rushes when it shouldn't and drags when it needn't. Wooden acting and painful writing make The Phantom Menace the absolute worst entry in the Star Wars saga.
"May 10, 2015",2.5,"Extremely disappointing with very small character development and story and lots of CGI (which haven't aged very well, by the way). No way did it live up to the hype."
"May 10, 2015",2,"Very awful prequel. The only things I liked about the film was the Pod racing, space battle with Anakin, but I enjoyed the fight with Darth Maul. Even though at first Maul and the Jedis didn't have any grudge on each other, till the end.
The dialogue was off. Casting Anakin was mishandled, you don't care about Anakin. I have so many questions about the fight with Darth Maul, it's laughable.
Overall, this movie will be your least favorite Star Wars movie."
"May 08, 2015",4,"Great = 4/5

Perhaps the first Star Wars I ever saw. Despite how popular and ""cool"" it is to hate on the prequels, ""The Phantom Menace"" is still a Star Wars film that I love and enjoy to this day, regardless of its flaws."

"May 05, 2015",1.5,"It's hard to believe that a movie that looks so beautiful can truly be this boring. I don't think I've ever tried harder to care about characters who did nothing to return my attempts at affection.

"May 04, 2015",2.5,"Unfortunately too kitschy for one's tolerance, as well as suffering from some rather laughable acting and dialogue. The Phantom Menace's solid story is unfortunately taken a backseat to the overused (though very well executed) effects and mostly importantly, JAR JAR."
"May 04, 2015",3.5,"First of the prequel movies, bits of this movie are awesome while others tend to drag on somewhat.
The Pod Racing and end Lightsaber duel with Darth Maul are standout pieces.
Jar Jar Binks leading an army assult not so much."

"Apr 08, 2015",1.5,"The first entry to the Star Wars prequel is visually entertaining thanks to its action sequences but doesn't make it a major hit due to its characters being undeveloped, a plot that should have been better written and unrelentless unsychronized voices that takes all the fun out from the CGI scenes."
"Apr 07, 2015",1,"this is one of the worst movies of all time!!! the characters suck! the effects look sloppy! and its so boring and slow! there are so many plot holes, but I found two things I like about it the battles are good (but there are barley any) and the john Williams score is great! and that's it so don't check it out!!!!!!!!"

"Mar 30, 2015",3.5,"Llega a ser algo medio aburrido por el enfoque que le dieron a tantos temas politicos que a muchos no les importa, poseer momentos estupidos (Jar Jar Binks) y otros personajes que pueden llegar a ser molestos. Aun asi con sus defectos, tiene sus puntos rescatables como las escenas de accion, el elenco protagonico, los efectos especiales y la magistral banda sonora de John  Willians. La mas floja de la saga."
"Mar 28, 2015",3,"There was so much hype before this movie came out. People set their expectations so high that they were very disappointed after watching this movie. Some people even claim that this is one of the worst movies of all time. While it's not as good as the original trilogy this movie does have some good parts. A cool villain that was killed off very stupidly, the pod racing sequence and in my opinion the best choreographed fight in the entire series with duels of the faith playing in the background, it was epic. Yes this movie has a lot of flaws but this movie is not as bad as people make it out to be."
"Mar 23, 2015",3,"""MORE STAR WARS! MORE STAR...oh, was that it?""

Easily the worst film in the 'Star Wars Saga', 'The Phantom Menace' just falls flat and feels like a waste of time. There is too much reliance on CGI, the acting from Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker) is the cringiest thing the world has ever seen, and Jar Jar Binks will make you want to punch the screen. However, it is still watchable and does hold up as a good film, but it won't make you say anything more than 'meh' when the credits roll."
"Mar 21, 2015",2,"It's not horrible. But, it is flawed. Especially the droids vs the JAR JAR BINKSES battle sequence. Man! It was horrible. But there are moments of brilliance in this movie. Especially the scene where Terrence Stamp was debating about Palpatine. That was actually cool. That being said, don't expect this movie to be some kind of a cinematic tour de force. Just accept it as it is. I always considered the prequels as a bad first season of a TV series and the original the opposite. Perhaps it is time for people to see it as I see it."
"Mar 15, 2015",2,The ruining of a icon. Jar jar is the worst character ever designed.
"Mar 13, 2015",2.5,"Long, boring, too much exposition and CGI make this Star Wars film turn the series surprisingly backwards."
"Mar 13, 2015",3,the sword fight at the end was good.
"Mar 01, 2015",3,"Obviously the weakest link in all of the Star Wars films, ""The Phantom Menace"" suffers from a poorly written script and mediocre child acting. Although the story keeps us somewhat interested throughout the course of the plot, character development is weak and I didn't feel attached to the characters or feel anything when something happened to them. Visually the film is well off especially for its time, with a considerable improvement in CGI over the original trilogy. Visuals mean a lot but screenplay is equally as important and ""The Phantom Menace"" clearly falls behind in this category.

Also, Jar Jar Binks is the worst character ever. Not just in Star Wars, but the worst character in cinematic history. Such an awful attempt at comic relief. Sigh."
"Feb 23, 2015",4,"I believe this is an underrated movie. It's acting was decent at best, however there are many things to like about this movie.  The effects were outstanding, the action was great, especially the Darth Maul vs. Ob Wan/Qui Gonn lightsaber battle, and the music was very good."
"Feb 21, 2015",3,"A letdown from the original trilogy, because of the movie's obvious stereotypes, cheesy dialogue, lack of character development with some poor characters; despite the good visuals and decent story, is sadly a only average prequel."
"Feb 16, 2015",4.5,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is a tricky start to the new prequel trilogy. Director George Lucas comes back in great form once again and delivers great effects and great sound design.
"Feb 09, 2015",3,"Very boring, not nearly as good as the previous trilogy"
"Feb 08, 2015",2.5,"Starts out boring, continues to be boring throughout, and by the time we get to the massive battle at the end, I’m just wanting it to be over. Without the name Star Wars attached to it, this movie would’ve been forgotten long ago."
"Feb 08, 2015",3.5,"when Star Wars came out in 1977 it was already called episode IV, which lead to many questions and theories for years. at the time George Lucas says that technology didn't exist to allow him to make it the way he wanted to. However, I doubt that this was what he had wanted to do in the 70s either, unless the real reason he did New Hope first because there likely wouldn't have been more than one movie wise. however, for what it was it was pretty good. JarJar was pretty funny even if inappropriate, as an adventure film it was good and made me smile. This VHS tape makes its way out almost once a year."
"Feb 07, 2015",2.5,"Far and away the worst film in the Star Wars lineup.  As a lifetime fan, I remember the anticipation leading up to this movie.  I remember, too, the profound disappointment that followed the credits as I sat in the theater.  I wanted to like it, but, if I'm being honest, it's a completely unnecessary movie.  The politics of Naboo (and beyond) aren't enough to sustain the 2+ hour runtime, and then there's Jar Jar.  A more insufferable alien there is not."
"Feb 07, 2015",4.5,"As a child of the 90's I grew up watching the original Star Wars trilogy on the 1997 Special Edition VHS box set which fans of the saga who saw the originals in theaters dislike. However, they were the only way I knew Star Wars and it was a love of a franchise my father and I have shared ever since. I am extremely bias and love this movie with all my heart. Watching this movie in theaters as a child was surreal because I finally was able to experience the amazement of seeing a Star Wars film on the big screen. That being said this movie is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. In my non bias opinion the Pod Racing sequence is one of the best moments of the Star Wars saga and is directed great by Lucas. This film also had a lightsaber battle that was unlike anything any fan of the franchise has seen before or even imagined."
"Feb 06, 2015",2.5,Not a fan. Reminded me of a children's show even more than the older Star Wars movies and just didn't at all fit in.

"Jan 23, 2015",4,Doesn't live up to the original. It's great to be back in the Star Wars world but it ends up killing off the two best parts of this new trilogy.

"Jan 08, 2015",3,"Star Wars Episode 1- The Phantom Menace is universally known from fans of Star Wars and movie buffs as the most disappointing film since Mr. Plinkett's son (whoever got that reference, you are a wonderful person.) But after 16 years of bashing with this film by fans and critics, is it still as bad? .......Well, yes and no. Now this review is OBVIOUSLY from a movie buff and HUGE Star Wars fan, and also this review should be taken as just an OPINION (meaning i'm not acting like i have a factual and therefore amazing opinion on these PT films,) so take it with a grain of salt. With that said, after a rewatch of the film, my opinion is sadly what others say that where people who hated the PT and critics who reviewed it have said: the acting is wooden, the story is useless and unneeded to fill in any gaps into newer films, lacks charisma and a sense of wonder, exposition and special effects take up the norm, and Jar-Jar binks is still annoying (even if he is the only one with any form of emotion.) However, compared to AOTC this looks like the Citizen Kane of the series and also, to my surprise,  it did have some decent moments that don't make it the WORST film ever. The action, while tensionless and CGI orientating, had some moments of well done spectacle, when it didn't date of course, Darth Maul was a menacing part just like Boba Fett, and the last sequence with Maul, Jinn, and Kenobi is visually, though tensionless and not gritty like the fight with Vader and Luke, is enjoyable. In the end, i find this film just 'Average', and for a SW fan such as myself, this film had Lucas exploit his ownership of the series and basically giving a finger to his producer that helped him since the start, Gary Kurtz."
"Jan 02, 2015",3,Sebulba really is the Coach Cal of podracing
"Jan 02, 2015",3,"Perhaps THE most monumentally disappointing film based upon its expectations, Star Wars episode I may lack characterisation, quality dialogue, or any elements which excuse its lackluster premise, but moments such as the podrace mean this wasn't a complete disaster."

"Dec 31, 2014",2,"The less said about Jar Jar Binks, the more you could try to enjoy this film! Wait! Did I just say that? I mean to say, if you are looking for a film that is top notch in the acting and storyline, then this isn't the movie for you! Dead behind the eyes characters, and a story with enough holes in it to make Swiss cheese blush! What a wonderful opportunity here wasted!"
"Dec 30, 2014",4,this movie is amazing
"Dec 29, 2014",1.5,"Review In A Nutshell:

Why does George Lucas intend to complicate his universe? Does it really need this political concept to make its universe feel more plausible, if so why do we need to deeply explore it? Why couldn't he just create a great film, with a great story, and with a great set of characters?

It was so difficult to care for anything the larger story it is trying to tell, and the intimate human story that linger beneath it is not great either. The film spends a hefty amount of time exploring the world, the religion, and the rules that it forgets to become what the previous trilogy was able to deliver, accessibility. I came into this immediately confused and disinterested about the conflict between the Federation and the Republic; ergo making their journey enjoyable only superficially through the action set-pieces that Lucas has crafted. Funnily enough this film acts as an origin story for Anakin Skywalker, yet character development in scarce, learning nothing significant about the character that isn't already obvious; clearly he is a special child, but why does the film keep coming back to that? Why doesn't the film focus more on the child's experience with his separated mother, or the effects of slavery it has had on him? Lucas has always envisioned the franchise as a story that is appropriate for all ages but it seems here that he is only concerned with pleasing the younger audiences, excite their shallow and superficial nerves rather than create content that would leave the audience in deep thought or to be emotionally moved.

The only element that saved me from completely trashing this was the beauty of Lucas' world and delightful sequences he conjures up throughout. The battle scenes have the potential to give one chills; I mean how could you not, when you are given one of the best villains of the entire franchise. Another highlight was the pod-racing scene, with sheer intensity and tension, leaving me in awe in almost every moment.

It is really too bad that the film only succeeds in small pieces throughout the film; failing to grasp me with its story and characters. I also cannot believe that Jar Jar Binks became the film's primary supporting character, when C3PO and R2-D2 are already brilliant, possessing natural and hilarious chemistry. This film is so damn straining."
"Dec 29, 2014",3,"The phantom menace is a film with things to like but simultaneously has so much to loathe. let's start with the positives, For one the locations is the phantom menace are vey beautiful to look at with such colour and vibrancy, the action sequences are bombastic but fun to watch with CGI that is mostly good, Liam Neeson while not given much depth as a character still remains has a likeable presence, the film also has great cinematography.
But of course the phantom menace is littered with flaws For one the characters are given very little development for me as an audience member to invest in or care about, the story is filled to the brim with boring politics that is often way to incoherent and over complex to keep my interest, the dialogue is mostly cheesy and cringe worthy, the acting from  Ewan McGregor,Jake Lloyd, Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley and Samuel Jackson is just utterly lifeless and monotone and the film has an over reliance on CGI effects resulting in some scenes to feel inorganic and sanitised.
4/10

"Dec 25, 2014",2.5,"As a child who doesn't know better, I loved this movie. But as a 20 year old man, I can see through the rubbish plot and oh so wooden acting. I can still feel nostalgic over the final Darth Maul battle, but this episode in the Star Wars saga Is very forgettable."
"Dec 24, 2014",3.5,"After being a fan of the originals for so long. The announcement of new Star Wars films was huge for me. This film delivers what I thought I wanted from the film as a kid. Looking back on it years later, I enjoy it for other reasons now. Liam Neeson is great as Qui-Gon Jinn and the rest of the cast do their best with what they are given. I don't think this film deserves as much hate as it has garnered as of late, but it is enjoyable enough to be a prequel to a world we already know about."
"Dec 24, 2014",1,Terrible. Only saving grace is the special affects
"Dec 23, 2014",4,"While its narrative isn't as complex as The Empire Strikes Back (honestly, none of the other five films are), and building on a world already established long before it, lacks the freshness of A New Hope, The Phantom Menace is still an improvement over Return of the Jedi. For all the criticism George Lucas unjustly and justly deserves, what he's accomplished here can't be taken away. With the advancements in CGI technology that he didn't quite have during the '70s and early '80s, Lucas has expanded upon the worlds he created in the first film, pushing the boundaries of special effects into the 21st century, while also expanding on the Jedi mythos that became a worldwide phenomenon ever since the words ""May the force be with you."" were first uttered.

"Dec 22, 2014",4,"Idgaf how much worse it is than the original. I love Star Wars, and this has friggin duel of the fates."
"Dec 22, 2014",2,"It is not blinded by excessive gleaming CGI, which is more than can be said for the other two prequels. However, too many aspects of it just don't work: Darth Maul could have been developed into a memorable character; Anakin is almost as annoying as Jar Jar; the acting is transgressively wooden; and its attempt at comedy through the Gungans falls hopelessly short."
"Dec 18, 2014",3,"My disappointment with this film is akin to discovering the man behind the curtain, finding out Santa and the Easter Bunny don't exist all at the same time!"
"Dec 17, 2014",3,Better than people think
"Dec 14, 2014",3,"After fifthteen  years, this movie still gets bashed by many. If you can accept the flaws, it's actually good cinema. The plot wasn't terrible, it was just poorly execution, mainly due to George Lucas' long vacation. Now while the dialogue is stiff and monotone, the film makes up with it's dazzling visuals and octane action scenes. Phantom Menace will never kick the original, but its a good popcorn flick for fans and un-fans."
"Dec 09, 2014",5,"I gave this a 5 Star Mainly because of my love for Star Wars and I thought the Villain Darth Maul was the saving Grace of the film.  The Choreographing of the Final Lightsaber duel was Amazing.  Overall the Prequels have their shortcomings but, are still entertaining in a fun popcorn movie way."
"Dec 09, 2014",3,"The Star Wars movie that has shown that George Lucas has added even more imagination and an even crazier visual flare then the original trilogy. But all that seems to be the main replacement for the originals humor, simple and whimsical story, and memorable characters. The Phantom Menace is the first in two blows to the loyal Star Wars fandoms faith in the saga."

"Dec 09, 2014",0.5,Honestly have no clue how anyone could rate this movie positively.
"Dec 08, 2014",1,Stars simply because space is cool. That is all.
"Dec 06, 2014",2.5,"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is the perfect guide for how not to make a movie. The acting is mediocre. Jack Lloyd is awful as a young Anakin Skywalker. The script makes his performance even worse. The spirit of the original trilogy is missing. The impressive lightsaber fight at the movie's climax, and John William's score are the only parts of this film which are enjoyable. I will not mention Jar Jar Binks, because my comments would only be unkind. The Phantom Menace fails to measure up to its predecessors in nearly every way imaginable."
"Dec 06, 2014",3,"It has some extremely awesome elements, but some uncannily horrible elements (Jar-Jar, Dialogue). It's Star Wars, though."
"Dec 04, 2014",1.5,For the most part a boring movie with it's only redeeming quality being an extremely entertaining final fight.
"Dec 04, 2014",2,"This is not the disaster many people claim to be but yeah, it's not very good either. The problem mostly relies on the plot which... come on, are you really going to the theatre to watch Star Wars and get very thin political intrigue? Incredibly thin characters? Superfluous racing scenes (which is awesome but adds 0 to the story)? One lame villain that looks awesome, completely wasting its potential by killing it too soon? Having pretty much the future movies spoiled for you? Jar Jar?

Sound design wise, this is as incredible as it gets. Just check all the detail put onto the Pod racer, it's fantastic, showcasing how much of a genius Ben Burt is. There's also some interesting connections to future movies and some nice inventiveness on a visual level, but other than that, it's a complete miss for the franchise."
"Dec 01, 2014",1,The disappointment I felt after walking out of the cinema will always be in my memory.
"Nov 30, 2014",0.5,"Dull, illogical, underwhelming. Don't even bother. "
"Nov 30, 2014",2.5,"Three big issues with this film... The acting, Jar Jar Binks, and young Anakin."
"Nov 29, 2014",2,This movie is not good. But you have pod racing and the duel of fates to help make it only somewhat awful.
"Nov 28, 2014",1,Unwatchable. Why did this have to get made? Stale acting and and a horrible script are what makes this movie bad. Special effects can't save this film.
"Nov 17, 2014",2,"A big mashup of awkward CGI, bad acting, and cheesy plot. 39/100"
"Nov 11, 2014",0.5,The people who say An Unexpected Journey was a bad first installment of a prequel trilogy have obviously never seen The Phantom Menace. This film makes An Unexpected Journey look like freaking Citizen Kane!
"Nov 11, 2014",2,Misa not happy wit dis movie :(
"Nov 06, 2014",1,"The first and only time I sat through The Phantom Menace, my reaction was ""Well, there's 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back.""  Let the fanboys make all the excuses they want, but this film was just terrible.  And I don't just mean that in reference to its disappointment as a Star Wars film; it's a terrible movie in its own right.  If it didn't have ""George Lucas"" and ""Star Wars"" tacked on to it, it would have bombed at the box office and been long-forgotten."
"Nov 06, 2014",3.5,"Yes, as a 90's baby, this movie's ad campaign was the first exposition I had to the Star Wars universe, and no, I have not jumped on the prequel-hating bandwagon since. Considerably flawed compared to the more modest originals, and blighted with some clunky dialogue, questionable character development, and a clumsy plot, but it delivers in the area of action, and serves to entertain, as Star Wars always has. Still including this in my semi-annual marathon, no matter what haters say."
"Nov 03, 2014",4,"I liked it, it was action packed"
"Oct 30, 2014",3,"The first installment of the prequel trilogy gets a lot of flak due to some obvious and some misplaced hatred. The movie wasn't extremely disappointing but bad in Star Wars standards, even a die hard fan would agree. An okay watch for the continuity of saga and introduction to the back-story."
"Oct 29, 2014",4.5,"While it's not the best in the prequel trilogy, Star Wars Episode I lives up to the original trilogy and provides a fantastic lightsaber battle at the end. There are a few grimacing moments at the dialogue but they pale in comparison to other parts of the movie."
"Oct 28, 2014",3,This movie would have been way better if it wasn't for stupid Jar Jar Binks and young Anakin Skywalker but other than that this film is pretty decent
"Oct 27, 2014",3,"Good movie not like the other Star Wars but compared to an
Average movie it's great"
"Oct 25, 2014",2,As an impressive sequel/prequel it turned out to be it's presented as a beginning-like story for the original trilogy and it's heavily laid back by a terrible comic-relief character called Jar Jar Binks and it's indecency to tell a good story.
"Oct 19, 2014",2,"Despite its complete lack of true Star Wars essence,and lots and lots of bad acting,horrible script writing and ""midichlorians"",The Phantom Menace is just a big disappointment for everyone not just fans.The action is always too choreographed therefor emotionless and the dull boring dialogue is painfully enough for the audience.But despite all that and the character of Jar Jar Binks, there are enjoyable moments in this movie."
"Oct 16, 2014",1,Not the worst thing I've ever seen....but I will certainly never be watching it again
"Oct 14, 2014",2.5,"Easily the worst of the Star Wars movies, but hey, it's still Star Wars, bad dialogue and uninteresting characters, bar Darth Maul, make this sometimes uncomfortable to watch, but to me, it does have a nostalgic factor of back in the day that I can't shake off"
"Oct 10, 2014",3,Cool story. It's a fun world to get lost in. Looking forward to seeing the rest of the series.
"Oct 09, 2014",2,"All unmet 1999 fanboy expectations aside, I can now watch The Phantom Menace with different eyes now that I know where Luas and the broader Star Wars Universe was going.  I can appreciate the whole midichlorians, Chosen One, etc components that in 1999, pissed me off.  However, the first 20 minutes of Episode I are still the worst 20 minutes of the 6 film stretch.  Getting past them is hard, but once I do, I'm sucked in and, despite the subpar acting and even less impressive dialogue, I'm too in love with the whole Star Wars thing that I'm immediately in line for this 3D version.  Seeing Episode I, not filmed in 3D, rotoscoped to appear 3D is absolutely elementary.  We are talking ILM, here.  And even they couldn't get it right.  Unless you want to experience Episode I in the theater again, don't waste your money on the 3D."
"Oct 08, 2014",3,"Besides the annoyances and blandness, Phantom is still a pretty decent and enjoyable film, but it's also unfocused and cheesy."
"Oct 06, 2014",4,"Mostly of Star Wars fans hate the prequels, but The Phantom Menace offers a good story about the origins of Darth Vader, one of the most recognized villains of history. The movie is very exciting, full of well played action, moderated comedy and drama. It has good music by the master of scoring John Williams, and a good script, well directed by the maker of the Star Wars universe: George Lucas."
"Oct 05, 2014",3,"Not always the best, but its still good"
"Oct 04, 2014",4,"By no means the worst but by no means the best. It's got Liam neeson in it, so it deserves some credit"
"Oct 04, 2014",3,"Though it features millions of problems, I always seem to see past them as this was a film I used to enjoy as a child. When on a rewatch, I couldn't help but feel people's hatred, as I got incredibly bored with the dull politics and, of course, the stiff acting. Not to mention Jar Jar Binks. However, once you TRY and see past them, it can make for a (kind of) fun ride, with good action, and Neeson and McGregor dazzling in the spotlight. Also, it features Darth Maul, a character who needed more screen time, but when he did he stole the entire show."
"Oct 01, 2014",0.5,Literally the worst movie I've ever seen
"Sep 29, 2014",3.5,That Jar Jar Binks really annoyed me.
"Sep 28, 2014",5,"Love it! Own it on DVD and on Blue Ray. I always love to watch it. Love all the characters, love the well told storyline, I enjoy every scenery, and I love the sound effects. Amazing, thrilling, fresh movie."
"Sep 27, 2014",0.5,"Pretty visuals do not make up for the lack of actual character personality, and the idea of any plot. Though Darth Maul, and the final fight, are what makes this movie tolerable. Honestly, why not just make Darth Maul the primary antagonist of the prequels, he would have been great!"

"Sep 10, 2014",1.5,"The Phantom Menace is the worst Star Wars movie ever made, and though it wants to give answers,it fails and all there is for this movie to offer are fight sequences choreographed poorly."
"Sep 08, 2014",2.5,"The light saver fight at the end was well pieced and very enjoyable. Unfortunately, the whole movie is more than that. While Liam Neeson acts well, one character makes sure to get the spotlight and not act at all. Jar Jar Binks annoys through a movie that flows well and then does not."
"Sep 03, 2014",1,"During the penultimate battle scene ramp up you think for just one freaking second that this has finally become a Star Wars movie. Then the main general turns to Jar Jar and says ""Ouch Time!"" and your hopes of this movie ever not sucking turn to ash in your mouth. Thankfully I've separated ""Anakin"" from the majesty of vader because holy crap does the kid playing him suck in literally every scene he is in, he looks like he had to leave the set to pee in almost every scene. Phantom Menace is also the most racist one, Jar Jar is on par with some of the worst crimes white people have committed. The Darth Maul fight is pretty badass and merits a star though."
"Sep 02, 2014",3,"65
Some bold new ideas and visuals might be aesthetically pleasing for fans of the original trilogy, and the John Williams score is terrific, but the script, actors, and director don't inject the fun of the original trilogy to balance it all out."

"Aug 29, 2014",3,"What the fudge??? Terrible movie, for the 1970s awesome but this was made in the 2000s. George Lucas, you have made the worst Star Wars out of all of them. Terrible costumes, special effects are great but the costumes are terrible. Liam nesson, great Qin gon jinn. Also the droids are terrible. Ok movie but overall 3 stars out of 5."
"Aug 29, 2014",1,So good it will make you want to gouge your eyes out.
"Aug 27, 2014",2.5,"Great lightsaber duoal and awesome dual of the fates theme, but Jar Jar ruins some scenes. Second to first least favorite star wars film."
"Aug 26, 2014",2.5,Bad way to start a trilogy.
"Aug 26, 2014",2,the worst star wars film
"Aug 25, 2014",2,"Beautiful performance of Liam Neeson and, of course, one of the greatest actors of his generation, Ewan McGregor. They are both more convincing than the movie - rather strange phenomenon. I never could really understand why George Lucas left some strong contradictions between the first and the second trilogies - he had 20 years of preparation!"
"Aug 24, 2014",2,"Its visuals are fantastic and the fight scenes are still top-notch in sci-fi. However, The Phantom Menace lacks emotions, plot details, and character development, even in the mysterious device that is Anakin Skywalker."
"Aug 24, 2014",1.5,I think it was fine till jar jar benks but the worst thing is the ending
"Aug 17, 2014",4,LOOOOOOOOOOOVED IT!!!!!!!
"Aug 16, 2014",1.5,podracing and Darth maul!
"Aug 15, 2014",0.5,A whole sci fi flick that revolves around trade or something? And Jar Jar Binks
"Aug 15, 2014",3.5,"I haven't seen this since I was a child, but some scenes stayed in my mind pretty well, like the Podrace or the final fight of Qui-Gon Jinn. In comparison to the 70's films it is indeed a disappointment, but viewed as its own movie, it doesn't deserve all the crushing criticism."
"Aug 14, 2014",3.5,"The one that basically started it all. Young Anakin Skywalker, younger Obi-Wan, and many of the other characters that exist in this movie and continue to appear in the others. The first time I saw this, I was surprised to see Darth Maul die, thus him only appearing in the first prequel. Just knowing how popular of a character he was, it was interesting to see him go pretty much just like *that*. The Naboo queen decoy was a bit questionable too. Who's queen exactly, Padme or Amidala (or are those names the same person in some way)!? Than again, the decoy idea seemed to have help during one of the fights. But other than that, this film as a whole is a neat start to the Star Wars series. One of my favorite parts of the movie is the pod race. In retrospect, I can pretty much tell why most people didn't care about this movie. It's probably not my favorite plot compared to the other two prequels, but it was still a pretty good movie."
"Aug 12, 2014",1.5,worst of the star wars movie they only thing that saved it from 1 star was the way fight with Darth Maul.
"Aug 11, 2014",3.5,"The strongest of the prequel trilogy, even with Jar Jar Binks in the majority of the movie. Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker is laughable, but not nearly as much as Hayden Christensen in Episodes II and III. The podrace scene is a highlight of the film. As is the final lightsabre battle featuring (spoiler alert) one of the most shocking movie deaths of my childhood."
"Aug 11, 2014",2.5,Interesting as it can be--and as awesome as the duel with Darth Maul at the end is--this movie is essentially ruined by Jar Jar Binks.
"Aug 10, 2014",3.5,"Amongst the weakest in the series. I say weakest because it is still a good movie. It just isn't on the level of the others. It's still a fun watch though. There is some wooden acting in this, and there are very little if any practical effects; it's CGI heavy. Also Jar jar binks is always gonna be annoying. However I thought Darth Maul was a cool little villain and Liam Neeson is great as always. Worth a watch and overall I'm glad the prequels were made. They're not nearly as bad as people and diehard fans say they are."
"Aug 10, 2014",1,Yaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwnnnnnnn

"Aug 05, 2014",3,"A decent movie, not bad.  Bad got very boring at times but I liked how they showed us young Anakin and his beginnings.  The pod racing scene was probably my favorite scenes of the entire movie."
"Aug 04, 2014",3,insults Star Wars franchise
"Aug 04, 2014",3,"since a new trilogy is about to emerge i decided to review this one. most regard this as the down fall of star wars due to its lame lines not much character, and jar jar. in my opinion its not bad  kind of like with man of steel where there is an equal amount of bad and good  but here seems little better just maybe less jar jar, give better dialogue better for the good side more planets, speacies i like Qui-Gon and obi wan, the musics is always awesome especially when you have kick butt lightsaber duels with darth maul."
"Jul 31, 2014",2,The thing that really makes me not like this movie is that there is no sense of fun or enjoyment. The characters are so wooden and you just don't care for them at all.
"Jul 30, 2014",0.5,"good job george lucas. you took all of the thoughtful characters, great screenwriting, and details of an amazing original world, and replaced them all with Jar-Jar Binks"
"Jul 28, 2014",2,"This film arrived to unbearable hype. Of course it doesn't live up to the hype, but even without the disappointment of not living up to the hype this is a very poor film. I was not expecting very much from this film but I was almost sickened by just how bad this film was. I am a Star Wars fan and this film made my childhood die a partial death.
The plot manages to be both thin and incomprehensible at the same time. Most acting in Star Wars films isn't the best but most of the time the characters just seem plain bored. Portman's Padme has a 'high speak' - her character has a droll monotone that kills the performance. Ewan McGregor plays Obi Wan like he's sedated throughout. No passion, no enjoyment, no fun. Darth Maul is completely pointless. He says about 5 lines in the whole film and so his character is very poorly developed. When Darth Vader said ""I find your lack of faith distirbing"" we COWERED. When Darth Maul appears he actually looks funny! He seems to be a token bad guy thown in just for the sake of having an evil chracter. Jake Loyd is an annoying brat who delivers his lines very poorly. And it has been will documented that Jar Jar Binks is very irritating indeed. Trouble is he's in nearly every scene. Anything meaningful or important is instantly ruined by Jar Jar belching lines like ""Yousa thinken yousa people gonna die?"". I felt no empathly or interest for any of the characters in this film. Even Samual L Jackson - a great great actor, falls flat when he arrives in this film.
A lot of the appeal of Star Wars is that there is hidden depths to the films. You can get into them more and more on mulitiple viewings. Trouble is in this film everything is so obvious and is rammed into our faces. Here are the droids C3P0 and R2D2 just meeting! Here's Jabba the Hutt! Here's some Jawas! It's all very unsubtle and obvious. There's nothing to notice on multiple viewings. Add to this some blatent mistakes and you have some very annoyed Star Wars fans. Why doesn't Obi Wan remember all these adventures he had with the droids when he meets R2D2 in eposide 4? Where are all these new digitally created aliens in episode 4? Do they become extinct? I will not accept that Anakin built C3P0. It's too perfect. I also thought that the Virgin birth idea of Anakin was very very dodgy indeed. Add some very unfunny toilet jokes like Jar Jar stepping in Bantha Dung and you begin to have an idea of how bad this film is.
Could the pod race be any longer? People kept saying how awesome the pod race was going to be and how much it ""kicked ***"". I found it rather boring. During the entire pod race sequence I am never fully convinced that Anakin is in a pod, rather I am reminded of the poorly done car sequences from the movies of the thirties and forties. It goes on for far too long. It sums up the film very well. It looks great but is poorly planned, and badly acted and turns out to be quite dull overall.
Yes this film looks amazing. We all know that. However this film has none of that magic of the other Star Wars movies. We get a feeling of lurching from one well-designed and great-looking set to another with no real purpose or direction. It should be an epic Space opera. It is actually very BORING.
The extras on the DVD are very good. We get very well presented documantaries, outlakes and bonus features. It's a feast for any Star Wars fan. This DVD is worth getting just for the extras alone. It's just a shame about the film. It's very fortunate that episode 2 was a vast improvement on this. Such a shame."

Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace is a come back to a franchise
that although is very disliked by some, I personally didn't mind as
much as I thought I might. It isn't the best film of all time and to be
fair Is far from good as it lags in certain areas, although it really
does boast some very good aspects and I will explain them as this
review goes along. I thought it was firmly OK-ish, and here below is
why I felt that about it all.

The story is one that starts well, but gets slower and slower and very
luckily never quite falls off the rails. It's pretty dramatic and what
do we all expect otherwise, big fights, space flights and Jedi
philosophy make it one massive soap drama of a film in a weird sense. I
very much liked the first half of the movie as it contains most of the
well made scenes, fights etc and George Lucas seemed to have written a
script and then given it to someone else to finish off.

Liam Neeson is the star acting wise in this film and his portrayal of
Qui-Gon Jinn is one that eclipses many others acting displays in the
Star Wars franchise as a whole. Ewan McGregor as his padawan legendary
Obi-Wan Kenobi is pretty good too and is the true definition of a
supporting actor doing his job well too. Young Jake Lloyd, well I could
say he is a kid and so he can't act so well, but he is just not good
even as a child actor, he has really no emotion and never truly
connects with any other characters, and also the audience.

George Lucas directs and writes this and his come back attempt to the
series from his point of view is not the best, the writing is only good
when philosophical issues are in and Lucas seems to excel in that area,
although when dialogue with action comes along, it fails quite a bit.
One of the biggest positives for this movie is the eye candy we see
with the special effects and maybe even the set productions, they are
great for 1999 and would pass for great effects way past that with
massive creatures and amazing spaceships among others, Any Star Wars
fan may be hard pressed to hate the effects side.

The main criticism for me was definitely in the story and it's fall mid
way through, the plot seems to dry up and very little good scenes
happen until maybe the very last few and the credits. Many people hate
the infamous Jar Jar Binks and his insanely annoying voice, I'll sit on
the fence with that one but it is true that he gets on your nerves and
so watch out if one character is going to make you absolutely hate a
film. You may also find Natalie Portman stale and poor, up to you but
it seems that way a lot in this film.

I could easily say, go watch this if you like Star Wars but it seems
many fans don't like it and so if you are new to the franchise or young
then just, don't listen to people who hate it and work out if you like
it yourself. This one is a bit like the other two prequels and is very
kid like at times, it's more like family fun but I think it could be
said that all the films in the series are pretty light hearted to a
certain degree.

Overall I give it a low 6/10, it is a Firmly Kind of OK movie in my opinion,
many people will disagree with that but some may think I underrated,
this has to be on the most split decision films of all times. As I said
before, don't listen to what others say and just watch it and have fun
also, after all it is still Star Wars and actually kind of key to
understanding a lot of things in the series so in a sense you need to
see this one anyway, to understand a lot of what is going on elsewhere."
"Jul 20, 2014",1.5,So ashamed to say I watched this garbage....
"Jul 19, 2014",1.5,A truly terrible movie.
"Jul 18, 2014",2,Worst entry in the Star Wars series by a long shot. Most of the movie is just plain boring.
"Jul 18, 2014",3,"Probably the worst of the series with a new cast containing Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman. This one is filled was a lot of comedy scenes all thanks to the character Jaja Binks. The only actor that did an amazing job was no other than Liam Neeson."
"Jul 17, 2014",2,"What I got to say about ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is a okay of a movie. But it's extremely to long, and I found it boring as well. The performances in this are okay. The directing and screenplay by George Lucas is creative. And the score is really good. And the effect are great."
"Jul 15, 2014",2,I love Star Wars but this wasn't what I remember I loved so much about it...dissapointing piece of shit except the final battle between Qui-Guon Jin(Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan(Ewan McGregor) vs The mysterious and under used Darth Maul.
"Jul 15, 2014",2.5,Is not as bad as they told me.
"Jul 15, 2014",4,"The 2nd trilogy of star wars movies is definitely not as appealing as the original trilogy, however Lucas still manages to present his clever and creative traits in the new installments very adequately."
"Jul 14, 2014",3.5,"Episode I has many flaws, but the premise never tires, and some brilliant action scenes more than make up for its faults."
"Jul 14, 2014",5,The 3D version was much better
"Jul 13, 2014",2.5,"I wanted to try to keep my thoughts and appreciations for the original trilogy out of my opinions for this film...but I couldn't help it. ""The Phantom Menace"" is wooden. Lifeless. Humorless. No romanticism in sight. No entertaining gags. The best performances come from Jake Lloyd and R2-D2. Neeson adds a controlled stoicism to his uninteresting character, which is the best he could do. As Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ewan McGregor is uncharacteristically bad. Just plain and emotionless; but, the thing is, it's not his fault. The writing is awful. The characters aren't interesting, we don't care if they're blown up or not. Only Anakin, Queen Amidala, and (of course) R2-D2, grab our concerns and cares. While the visuals are excellent...they get old quickly. After the first 30 minutes of seeing groundbreaking effects, we want a story and characters to get lost in and invested into. Unfortunately, ""The Phantom Menace"" never offers us anything of substance to hold on to and care for."
"Jul 13, 2014",2.5,"Let's be real. We loved it as kids (only for the lightsaber fights). But once you watch it as an adult, you start to understand why it was so bad. Overall, very disappointing film."
"Jul 09, 2014",0.5,"A pop-culture calamity, a soulless, emotionless film whose only real effect is to flash off it's big budget special effects, advertise new toys and grant a sequel."
"Jul 09, 2014",2.5,"It's not the worst of the prequel trilogy, but it still is a bad movie!"
"Jul 08, 2014",5,"Brilliant movie, effects and plot work for me... Love it."
"Jul 07, 2014",3.5,This movie may have it's problems but it still had the same spirit from Gorge Lucas that does show in the many great parts of the movie.
"Jul 06, 2014",2,"Though it wasn't terrible, it was horribly flawed and lacked the action we got got with the other Star Wars movies. Not even Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson could save it. Major let down. Only good thing, it didn't have Hayden Christensen."
"Jul 05, 2014",0.5,What it lacked in script and dialogue was totally overshadowed by some of the worst acting I've seen.
"Jul 05, 2014",3,"Some good sequences, but overall, too kid friendly to be taken seriously. Example:  Jar Jar Binks."
"Jul 04, 2014",4,"As prequel movies go, this is by far not bad. It Is the first in one of the most controversial prequel movie series of all time. In my mind, this movie was pretty decent. It could have included more details about Anakin's past and could have added more dialogue for Darth Maul( as he doesn't speak that much). Overall  it demonstrated a good idea of how it all started, but it didn't go into specific detail that much. The visual imagery in the film is outstanding and actors are all 100% believeable as their characters. Although this movie differs greatly from the original trilogy of movies, it still is sturdy enough that it spawned two sequels."
"Jul 02, 2014",0.5,"What a baffling movie. There isn't a main character and the story is nearly nonsense. Dialog is boring, Characters are boring, and the Villain (If there is one) has confusing and convoluted motives. The most important thing is that it lacks a message or a meaning. If you compare this film to the originals you'll notice the lack of humanity and a lack of a personal and emotional message. Even without comparing it to the original movies it is still complete ass germs. If you like this movie you are clearly lacking knowledge in the most basic forms of story telling and you should never try to make anything that has to do with with story telling. Try to stay as far away from the medium as you can. Maybe you should try out a physical sport or something similar that lacks above average brain power to achieve in. Boxing is cool. Maybe you should try boxing. I like Mike Tyson okay. If you're without the body type for that type of thing maybe you should work somewhere that keeps you far away from most normal people. Maybe you could work in the fish section at Pet Smart."
"Jun 29, 2014",2,This movie is probably one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen and it is so boring even though it does have a sweet lightsaber duel at the end
"Jun 29, 2014",2,"It is hard to review a movie as boring as this when there are so many superior edits of the movie. The Phantom Edit is easily a four star movie fan-edit, The Fall of the Jedi is four and a half, but the actual Phantom Menace movie itself gets a meagre two stars out of five.

The Phantom Menace is still the most disappointing movie out of the whole Star Wars saga so far, but it's still better than the whole of The 'Transformers' film series and certainly more entertaining than emo-vampires and werewolves who can't act to save their life.

There IS good in The Phantom Menace but throughout its two hour and ten minute runtime, it tries to evade Jar Jar's moronic actions and tries to forget about the struggling Jake Lloyd. A good movie is fighting to get out of this overstuffed clutter fest.

Thank you again, J.J. Abrams, for saving The Star Wars Saga with The Force Awakens. And thank you for not bringing up *shudders* the 'midichlorians'. The Force is a power and philosophy than cannot be explained via bacteria; it never should have been in the first place."
"Jun 27, 2014",3.5,"Some nice bits, the start, the pod race and the end fight,  I remember being dissapointed I had waited since seeing the originals as a kid for a kids movie.   My 8 year old loves this one though.   So that was the target market.  All about the Merch George."
"Jun 24, 2014",2.5,"This film has ten less percentage points than ""Attack of the Clones"" from critics, and I find that off.  Yes, Anakin is whiny.  Jar Jar is obnoxious.  Plot holes abound.  

But this is the first entry of the prequels.  Isn't it reasonable to say that this one should be the most lighthearted, and they should progressively get darker?  It's like life actually.  You start out laughing and silly, but eventually go through maturity and learn the dark truths of adulthood.

This movie is dumb, but as a child (which, admit it, was pretty much the target demographic) I enjoyed it.  I didn't care about taxation or nebulous politics, but I sat through them because I knew they'd catalyze a cool finale, which turned out to be a fun and inventive battle between Gungans and droids.  This battle is superior to the Geonosis battle in Episode II because the Gungans were distinct individuals (unlike the clones) and it mattered if they died, and the battle droids actually appeared menacing.  

As an adult I realize much of the dialogue is poor (like the midi-chlorian chat), the pod race was unnecessary, and Anakin's space victory was mind-numbingly idiotic.  But I also realize that Liam Neeson made an excellent Qui-Gon, Ray Park was stellar as Maul, and Jake Lloyd was not as horrible as he's been made out to be.  He was just a kid playing a kid.

So this isn't the worst of the prequels.  As Lucas himself said, the movie was made for children, so it can be forgiven for Jar Jar and Anakin to a degree.  But it's still bad, don't get me wrong."
"Jun 17, 2014",3,Sometimes boring but does a great job building the Star Wars universe
"Jun 16, 2014",2,"Jar Jar, Jake Lloyd, midi-chlorians, George Lucas' directing.  Need I say more?"
"Jun 16, 2014",4,It's the light saber scene between Qui Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi against Darth Maul that makes this movie worth wild to watch. It also reminds you why you love George Lucas and Star Wars
"Jun 16, 2014",3,"There are a lot of really bad parts in this movie, the classy Jewish stereotype for one, but it's still one of the best Star Wars movie (heads exploding everywhere)."
"Jun 14, 2014",4,"It truly is a good movie that really doesn't deserve the hate that it got. Jar Jar may be a little over the top, but people need to get over it, he didn't kill your mother  so enough w/ the hate. To me this movie was a success &amp; not a mistake because it turned Star Wars on to a whole new generation &amp; if not for this movie I probably wouldn't be as big of a Star Wars fan as I am today. So it is truly a good movie!"
"Jun 14, 2014",2.5,"This movie is a disgrace to ""Star Wars"" fans, almost everything about this is wrong, I mean what happened? I can't explain it, it's unexplainable. ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" has some cool moments, but that doesn't excuse the fact that this is a bad, uninspired movie."
"Jun 13, 2014",2.5,remember when people thought this was going to be good?
"Jun 12, 2014",3.5,"Compared to Hollywood's usual cynical garbage, this is actually a solid film. Don't believe the hater fanboys. Give it a chance."
"Jun 11, 2014",2.5,"The disgrace of Jar Jar Binks aside, Phantom Menace is just okay. Not as good as it might have been, but not as bad as many Star Wars fans have made it out to be. The dialogue is stiff, the characters wooden (and sometimes racist), and the acting is bizarrely monotone, but Lucas presents us with a world that is elaborate and visually pleasing, which keeps the movie moderately enjoyable."
"Jun 10, 2014",2.5,little anakin.....worst....acting....ever
"Jun 08, 2014",5,A movie with more pressure or expectations there has never been; this film exceeded expectations financially and gave a new generation a glimpse into the space opera their parents enjoyed a quarter century ago
"Jun 08, 2014",2.5,"Hooray! Star Wars returns to the big screen... and along comes Jar-Jar Binks to assist in spin-offs aimed at kids (that never happened).  Otherwise a decent watch, not a patch on the original trilogy though, (but there was worse to come in ep2.)"
"Jun 07, 2014",2.5,solo por la musica y la pelea final . . .
"Jun 06, 2014",2,Definitely the weaker of the 6 films just felt different  I understand Lucas was going in a whole other direction   great cast though .
"Jun 06, 2014",0.5,The film that killed Star Wars! Episode 7 can no way be wrose then this crap!
"Jun 06, 2014",2,"This is one of those films I couldn't get enough of when I was 5 year old, but when I got older realized how half-assed it was. Don't get me wrong, it has its moments. Darth Maul is an intimidating villain, and the twin bladed lightsaber is still one of my favorite types. Ewan McGregor was born to play a younger Obi-Wan, and should have had a larger focus. Qui-Gon was also a nice addition, but his motives seemed a little to difficult to predict and it seemed obvious he wasn't going to survive by the time the credits were rolling. The music, and some of the special effects, are fantastic, but practical effects would have been more welcome. But what suffers the most is its story, and that it doesn't meet the standards of the original trilogy."
"Jun 06, 2014",4.5,"It's surprising that the critical opinions were polarised. To me, it's a sci-fi classic"
"Jun 06, 2014",3,"Extra CGI makes Phantom Menace more convincing to look at but less convincing by the performers, and whilst some ill-advised decisions in the character department threaten to wreck it, there's enough beautiful choreography and visuals to enjoy the ride. Its no original, but there's enough great stuff in here to make it feel like a Star Wars film."
"Jun 05, 2014",3.5,"Neeson and McGregor are a delight to watch, as well as the beautiful effects and well directed fight scenes. The overarching ideas are good, but the dialogue is clunky and some scenes and additions are simply unnecessary."
"May 31, 2014",3,Rather disappointing but still worth watching
"May 29, 2014",4.5,Hey with the exception of Jar Jar this is great.
"May 28, 2014",2,"Is this a good movie? NOOO! You got ""Jar Jar Bunks"", the terrible kid actor who played ""Anakin Skywalker"", and the horribly not funny ""comedy"" that ruined the movie! The only things that save this movie from being awful, is the soundtrack, and the ""Darth Maul"" lightsaber fight."
"May 27, 2014",2,"Although the universe that this movie establishes is extremely important and well thought out, every little thing about this movie from start to finish will just make you die a little more inside.

- Details Breakdown -

The Good: Okay, so most Star Wars fans really are not terribly fond of this movie, let's get that out in the open right now, and they are justified for the most part. That being said, there are definitely aspects of this movie that are extremely important and should not be passed by.

The Republic and Coruscant:

Before this movie, nobody had any idea what Coruscant was or what it looked like or how important it was. There was also no such thing as The Republic really and nobody had a chance to see what it was like before The Empire was founded. This is a huge geopolitical point of interest in the Star Wars timeline and changes the way that the entire Star Wars universe is put into perspective. The universe gets a whole lot bigger and complicated with Episode I and isn't just one bad guy ruling a universe like it is in the original series. Sure, they reference the Imperial Senate in the original trilogy, but we get to see the Republic Senate in action, how the entire universe functions and Lucas did an exceptional job with that, not to mention using the entirety of Episode 1 to set up a massive political move on Palpatine's part.

The Jedi Order:

This movie also explains a lot of things, such as what did the Jedi Order look like before it was all wiped out. It also helps explain where they all went. Yes, the other prequels do that much better, but this movie sets up the fact that they genuinely think that The Force is out of balance NOT in their favor. The Jedi have grown complacent in peace time and think that they are still the victims, from a war that was fought probably thousands of years beforehand and they WON. There are hundreds of them and they are so freaked out about two Sith that they agree to train Anakin, who is supposed to bring balance to the force. Oh, he will bring balance to the force alright guys, and you will all be dead because of it.

The Bigger Picture:

A lot of the plot to this movie gets glossed over due to the horrendous script and acting, but a lot of what is happening is actually extremely important. The Trade Federation is a huge deal in the movie because it shows other cultures and trade routes and other such things that would in fact be part of a galaxy full of different people groups. Factions are trying to constantly gain more control through taxation and controlling travel routes. There are also the Hutts, which gain much more notoriety in this movie as basically the Mafia and they control entire star systems, which shows the number of political forces out there in the galaxy. The Star Wars universe expanded from this tiny little story about a moister farmer on a dinky planet saving everyone, to this massively scaled free for all in the universe for power. It makes a lot more sense and finally gives Star Wars the scale that the title assumes.

The Bad: Basically everything about this movie from start to finish is an embarrassment unfortunately. From a technical standpoint, the movie is literally trash, and here is why:

Audio:

Audio is out of sync, unbalanced, and all of it is voiced over and recorded separately. Nothing feels right when characters open their mouths to talk, because they did a piss poor job of dubbing over themselves for the entire movie. You can tell it is all dubbed because all emotion is removed from the lines and they all sound the same, like they were read off a script in a voice over studio and the actors weren't told how to act for the scene.

Acting:

Good lord George, have you ever heard of taking more than one take? I feel like George just gave his actors the scripts and let them free and recorded the first take he got of them and moved on. The correct actions and lines (well, that's debatable) are there, they just all feel so robotic, like the actors are just warming up to the scene and are just focusing on hitting their marks rather than getting a quality scene. I would have said the actors suck horribly, but many of them are phenomenal actors, so clearly the only one to blame is George. Also, I didn't check who the AD was on this movie, but they should have been fired. The extras in this movie didn't seem to know what the hell was happening and constantly had weird expressions frozen on their faces or were stuck on a loop. Also, not everyone in the galaxy should stare at the main characters or raise them on their shoulders. It's a big universe, nobody should even know who these people are really, much less care enough to look at them.

Editing:

A lot of the awkwardness in this movie comes from the editing bay actually. A lot of horrible moments could have been saved if the editor had just trimmed the fat more. Too much space is given between actor dialogue to make it feel like a real conversation and too many shots linger on especially awkward lines. If an actor gives an awkward performance, cut away to something else, don't linger there and watch them give the same nauseating expression.

CGI:

The bane of this movie really was the CGI. If they had used Andy Serkis, they would have been fine, but having dozens and dozens of characters that 100% do not exist for the real actors to constantly interact with creates a huge problem. Eye lines are in the wrong place, actors don't know what to do with themselves while their invisible counterpart is ""speaking"" and the CGI characters all look different and clearly stand out against the living actors. They're even a different tint than the rest of the movie and a bit washed out and brighter, which is even stranger.

Shoe Horning:

One of the big things about this movie that annoy me is how Lucas felt the need to shoehorn elements from the original series into this movie every ten seconds. Whether it be a super weird and completely unnecessary scene where R2-D2 is introduced and given a commendation, or it be a super obvious reference back to the events that will happen in the future of the original series. It makes it so the movie is literally screaming at me the whole movie saying, ""LOVE ME LIKE YOU LOVED THE ORIGINALS!!!! PLEASE!!!"" and it gets old really fast."

"May 26, 2014",2.5,"1999's first chapter of George Lucas's space opera (Building quite the fan-base from the first released film in the series-1977's A New Hope), Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is a clumsily told, poorly paced, quantity over quality opening act but still has enough of the force in it to not be dismissed entirely. Opening with talks of taxation and trade embargoes, it seems that Episode I's focus is more on the political side of things and although this isn't new to the series (A New Hope's dialogue comprises of similar topics), it was never the main emphasis of the plot and the execution is woefully misdirected and comes off as dull and boring. To counter this, Lucas attempts to sprinkle comic relief throughout the picture (again, a similar trope that worked with the previous installments) but the material doesn't fit and the humor is too childish (fart jokes don't belong in a Galaxy Far, Far Away) to resonate and fit with the established tone. This lack of tone and focus ultimately cripples the viewing experience of Episode I, but even then the film still has redeeming qualities (it is a Star Wars picture after all). Liam Neeson spearheads a good cast to fill any humanity that the film attempts to offer, while giving a decent amount of mystic, intelligence and intrigue in his performance, but again, the lack of clarity on Lucas's direction leaves everyone else giving stiff, monotone, performances (which Natalie Portman perfected). The performances could be better and with a script with little to no fluidity or urgency, Lucas places a majority of Episode I's stock into the visual effects of the film, leaving it looking great but as a whole, feeling hollow. As John Williams' iconic score closes out Episode I, George Lucas's return to the franchise will be remembered as a visually striking film, but a massively disappointing entry to the Star Wars saga."
"May 24, 2014",2,"The only thing slightly good about this flick are the CGI effects. Everything else is a total misfire. I'm giving this a 4 outta 10, but even that feels too generous."
"May 24, 2014",2,"Episode I has a few scenes that are brilliantly shot and bring back the grandeur of the original trilogy, but overall its pacing is far too slow, and Jar Jar Binks is a very bad attempt at comic relief."
"May 23, 2014",3,"For all the crap Star Wars fans give it, I really didn't think it was that bad.  My one big problem was it felt longer then it probably was"

     Los of talking and bad direction/acting, but when the battle sequences start, the result is nothing short of thrilling. 
     An innovator of graphic effects and visuals, Phantom Menace, while not without flaw, earns its place in the epic Star Wars franchise."
"May 17, 2014",2,I sometimes question why this movie exists
"May 16, 2014",2,"Action alone does not a good movie make.
That is not a Yoda reference BTW.

What to say about TPM, I don't really want to retread ground that too many people already have gone over, because there's really no point in it.
A lot of people have said that George Lucas went wild with the Prequels and lost the plot fairly quickly in terms of what he wanted to get and what we actually got and I don't agree...somewhat. The tone of these movies is a corruption of paradise, to see a once great and benevolent democracy fall to infighting, mistrust and manipulation, everything is there to show that, we don't need to see Joe everybody's reaction to learning that part of his society is ready to go to war over something his government put into law, the main characters are for that and that's part of where this movie falls downs.
The cast of this movie was very uninspired.
I see tropes everywhere for each of the main leads, from Qui-Gon to Shmi, they fit a nice and well known cookie cutter mould that would work in a stand alone movie, but this is set to be a trilogy of movies that is supposed to be an epic story.
Having every single box for a character you can instantly say fits a protagonist ticked just doesn't cut it in these movies.
I'll say this for the CG, it was used well for what they did, but in each of this trilogy, I feel like the effects guys and Lucas wanted to go so far overboard with design and sound that they simply made some scenes unwatchable, for this one lets take the Pod race, as far as I know most reviews have taken it apart for its lacklustre action and hammy acting and while I agree with that, I cannot stand ther overuse of the Thrumming of the engines, especially Sebulba's, bothered me in the cinema for the extent it was being used, and I know that was the reason behind it, that they wanted to show just how powerful and fast these things were, it still doesn't make it a good thing.
And y'know, I'll say it right here. The biggest screw-up of this movie wasn't Jake Lloyd being Anakin.
It was the terrible lines given to Jar-Jar.
I may be way off base here, but I think in Lucas' mind, from the stuff that he's said in interviews and during behind the scenes stuff, that Jar-Jar was going to be a big deal in these movies.
What if it were something along the lines of having Jar-Jar be the push for further and further removals of liberty by way of manipulation of Palpatine and have his innocent behaviour and clumsy manner be seen as a front by the Jedi who were also manipulated by Palpatine, which would have caused Jar-Jar to call for the removal of the Jedi, to be the voice of hate against the people he's come to loath?

Focusing too much of effect over substance and blindly choosing actors more on their looks than their acting talent made this a bad movie and not one I will watch unless there is nothing on or I am marathoning Star Wars."
"May 15, 2014",4.5,Qui-gon gets all the stars.
"May 13, 2014",4.5,A Good Start to a Great Saga........
"May 12, 2014",3,"Dear lord.  This is just a step down from the original trilogy.  Some acting performances are good, such as Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan and Liam Neeson as his master Qui-Gon Jinn, but the rest are simply wooden.  There is so much exposition, like Anakin having built C-3PO, most of which is just unnecessary.  The action is great, and the effects are good.  But that cannot save the movie from going to where star wars should never go: mediocrity."
"May 11, 2014",2,"I was so excited seeing this in the cinema. I would have been around 13 at the time and couldn't wait to see it. I sat in the seat eager to witness a new chapter in the Star Wars saga. As the film went on I grew less and less enthusiastic the whole feel of the film isn't Star Wars. 
    The ships don't have the same look and appeal as the X Wings Tie Fighters and Super Star Destroyers. The introduction of Jar Jar Binks is quite possibly the biggest mistake in movie history. He's supposed to be funny, he's not in the slightest. He is in fact incredibly annoying and every moment he's on screen you're hoping Qui Gon is just going to get annoyed and behead him with his light sabre!
    The film seriously lacks the presence of a Han Solo type character. The majority of people in the film are either Jedi, politicians or soldiers. There aren't many smart one liners in this as a result. I do however like the light sabre sequences they are very well put together. I don't know why Lucas decided to kill off Darth Maul as early as he did. I believe he would have made a much more interesting adversary than Count Dukoo. 
    It's a shame because with a rewrite and a return to more practical effects the prequels could've been as good as the original trilogy. The story Anakins demise should've been a compelling one. Unfortunately with the exception of the last half of revenge of the sixth it really isn't worth watching."
"May 10, 2014",2,"It's interesting that George Lucas is both the creator, and the worse thing that has happened to this franchise.  The writing and directing are both the weakest parts of this movie.  With the exception of the visual effects, there is nothing special about this movie."
"May 10, 2014",1.5,"Best of these movies--not good. The battle of Jedi and Sith is cool, and every once in a while I can spot out a real set, and the acting is mostly good. But who's the main character? And why is this so political, boring, and racist??"
"May 10, 2014",4,The mere presence of Liam Neeson as a Jedi makes this a good starter.
"May 07, 2014",2.5,"The Prequel Which The Star Wars Community Was Waiting For And Was Disappointed With. This Film Is Drawn Out In Some Places And Features Heavy Dialougue That Has To Be Understood That Tells Political Side Of The Rise Of The Empire. This Sadly Has To Be Done Or No Good Can Come From The Prequel Trilogy. Although Episodes 2 &amp; 3 Feature Political Dialouge It Doesn't Overpower They Films Respectively. This Is An Entertaining Film, Which Has Such A Bad Reputation. This Film Shows The Start Of Palpatine's Rise To Power Which Is Famous In The Original Trilogy, You Can't Just Jump In From When He's Been Building It For 10 Or 15 Years That Would Be Idiotic. The Film Is Made Up Of Family Friendly Action Scenes Which Keeps This A Suitable Family Film. The Cast Give Wonderful Performances With The Decent Script Provided. Sad That The Plot Did Drag A Bit Though But It Never Stopped The Massive Fan Base From Seeing The Sequel's Which Wouldn't Have Been As Good As They Are If Most Of The Political Plot Was Not Explained Here."
"May 06, 2014",5,Neeson's finest hour!
"May 05, 2014",1.5,"Arguably the biggest letdown in movie history. People went in expecting to see a film as good as the original but instead they got a boring, tasteless plot and the only thing you remember from it is the darth maul fight. Plus, jar jar binks, ugh."
"May 04, 2014",0.5,"I really looked forward to this movie. I really did. I even tried to tell myself that it was good, despite  being annoyed by Jar Jar or the Trade Federation guys. I didn't find it plausible that a 14 year old can be the head of state on Naboo. There were cool things like the Qui-Gon character &amp; the special effects. The final lightsaber battle with Darth Maul &amp; John Williams's brilliant score didn't help my internal struggle. But logic &amp; truth prevailed &amp; I finally accepted that I didn't like this film. The one thing I learned from this experience - it's OK to hate bad dialogue, bad acting &amp; that life will bring you cinematic disappointments (as long you deal with them). 

P.S. - I hope ""The Force"" is on J.J, Abrams's side for Epsiode VII."
"May 04, 2014",3.5,"Not bad at all, but absolutely did not need thirty minutes of podracing."
"May 04, 2014",3,Not worth all the harsh criticism. It was a PG movie made for kids. I think a lot of fan boys forget that. My nephews loved it and didn't find the story hard to follow. Liam Neeson was great.
"May 04, 2014",4,Take out Jar Jar and a few of the goofy droid scenes and it isn't 100% bad.
"May 04, 2014",2,"Pretty much the only thing about this one worthwhile is the visuals. Horrific dialogue and wooden acting across the board. Oh yeah, Jar Jar Binks."
"May 03, 2014",2,Being generous for Darth Maul and Liam Neeson
"May 03, 2014",0.5,Who wants to watch a film about taxes? apparently George Lucas does but no fans do.
"May 03, 2014",3,Good prequel not as good as others. Ages 8+
"May 02, 2014",4,i think this is the best film in the series it revives star wars with all its glory and gives you more insight into the star wars universe plus revamped it with awesome special effects. i know most star wars fans hate it but i still say watch it if you can tolerate jar jar binks.
"May 01, 2014",3,"I enjoyed this film much more when it was first released. After watching the Bluray I felt bored throughout the film. 

I still enjoyed the Darth Maul scene very much and the other battle scenes were also well made. 3/5"
"May 01, 2014",1.5,"Jar-Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd are only two of the massive missteps made by this now-famously-hated first prequel to the original Star Wars trilogy. At least Darth Maul was cool (and Ewan McGregor, who gives it his all through a so-bad-it's-amazing screenplay)."
"Apr 30, 2014",1.5,"For a fan of the original 70s and 80s movies, this was a massive disappointment"
"Apr 29, 2014",1.5,"Possible the worst prequel in my opinion. It's so bad that I didn't even have the patience to watch it all the way through. The only part of the movie that is worth watching is the fight with Darth Maul at the end. You literally do not need watch anything else in the movie, just the fight with Darth Maul. Too much CGI. I loved it when everything was made using practical effects like puppets and props. Thr whole movie doesn't feel like a real world, you just feel like you're watching some really bad green screen at times and blaster fights between CGI is no fun at all. Thr original Star wars was made in '77 and the special FX still look great, if not better looking than the prequels. Another thing i didnt like about this movie was Jar Jar. Enough said. Anyways, ever since The Force Awakens came out, I decided to watch all the Star Wars movies in order by release date. I personally like 5 and 4 the best from the original trilogy and only 3 from the prequels. The order from best to worst is (before the The Force Awakens of course) is 5, 4, 6, 3, and 2/1"
"Apr 29, 2014",2,"While the story concept is ok the film is full of stiff acting, poorly developed characters and a few racial stereotypes. While the choreographed fighting and visual effects are excellent, many wonder why this film even should of happened"
"Apr 28, 2014",2.5,"Even though I did not find the film to be as bad as most prequel haters found it to be, this movie had handfuls of flaws and little elements that could have made this such a better film. The biggest flaw this film had was that way too big of a portion of this film focused on politics. Jar Jar Binks was not the biggest flaw of this film like most would say, but he was very unneeded as he failed to be a funny character. Not going to criticize a kid for a terribly written character but it was painful to watch Darth Vader from that point of view. It's hard to visualize Darth Vader being a happy little kid saying ""Yipee"" who would then turn into that bratty kid in Episode II and then would turn to the darkside. Maybe if Anakin would have been the same age as Luke was in A New Hope, that alone would have made it a much better film. The lightsaber fight between Obi Wan and Qui Gon against Darth Maul towards the end was pretty entertaining and Liam Neeson portraying Qui Gon may have been no Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope but he did a great job. Ewan McGregor who had such an outstanding performance in Episode III was barely even used in this film. If Darth Maul later on turned out to have survived in the Clone Wars series, then they should have kept him alive and made him the antagonist in Episode II instead of boring old Count Dooku. Was this movie a disappointment for a film that was meant to be considered a Star Wars film? Yes it was, but was this overall a terrible movie? No, the Phantom Menace may did have an extremely large amount of flaws but it was not as bad of a movie as most Star Wars fans would consider it."
"Apr 27, 2014",1,"This movie was so bad it actually lowered my opinion of the originals, which were my favorite movies of all time. I just pretend these movies don't exist, otherwise some of my fondest childhood memories are ruined. Simply dreadful on all levels."
"Apr 27, 2014",3,Not as bad as people say. Although that floppy-eared thing was very annoying.
"Apr 25, 2014",4,"One of the best Star Wars movies!  Menace has the same feel as the prequels, but this one feels more real and yet still has a fantasy feeling.  It also has Liam Neeson."
"Apr 24, 2014",2,The only entertaining thing in the film is Darth Maul.
"Apr 24, 2014",0.5,damn you George Lucas
"Apr 22, 2014",3,"Episode I is a decent effort in the series. It's not the best, but it's not the worst. This is more of a ""connecting movie"" then an independent story."
"Apr 21, 2014",0.5,Boring. Ruins the Star Wars series. Should be taken out of the Star Wars canon. Enough said.
"Apr 16, 2014",3,"If only they had kept Darth Maul alive! Oh, and deleted that PITA Jar Jar!"
"Apr 15, 2014",4,"This is the movie that made me fall in love with the amazing Star Wars saga. I don't know how anybody could not like this movie when it has amazing characters like Qui-Gon , and everybody's favorite Obi-wan. And who could forget the amazing first sith apprentice there is in the series, Darth Maul. I loved this movie through and through, and I think that George Lucas did a truly great job making this film among all of the other ones as well."
"Apr 15, 2014",4,"Great film, but big disappointment in some of the acting from some big names"
"Apr 15, 2014",1.5,"An under-rated blockbuster epic. The Phantom Menace is visually stunning and a respectable start to a new trilogy. Although not as gripping as the originals, the acting is brilliant and the battle sequences are well thought out and intense. Letting it down is the poor scientific explanation for the Force, it wasn't needed."
"Apr 14, 2014",3,"Disappointing, but Darth Maul saves the movie"
"Apr 13, 2014",3.5,"Star Wars fans had waited a very long time for the prequels to be made, in 1999 their wait was finally over. However, after watching Star Wars- The Phantom Menace, many fans were left angry and disappointed. Their main qualms with the film was the introduction of a CGI character going by the name of Jar-Jar Binks. The combination of an irritating voice, stupid appearance and adding nothing to the story made him a very unlikable character. He was just an unwanted burden thrust onto the other characters and fans alike, he is easily George Lucas' worst creation to date. However, there is some positive points to take from this film. Such names as Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor come to mind, their acting performances helped towards saving the first of the three prequels. Plus, director George Lucas must be praised for the very good fight scenes and the exhilarating pod race. In conclusion, for me it didn't live up to the very high expectations set by the original films, but overall it is a quite enjoyable watch."
"Apr 12, 2014",2.5,"If any franchise needs a reboot, Episode 1 would be an excellent place to start. (Just leave the original trilogy alone). This was going to be the movie ""where it all began,"" introducing us to one of pop culture's most iconic villains. Instead, we get a poorly edited patchwork of scenes, stilted dialogue and cringeworthy racial stereotypes. Also, there's either a dearth of child actors or the casting director was drinking on the job - Jake Lloyd, the poor kid, should never have been made to live down his terrible performance as Anakin Skywalker. Meanwhile, Natalie Portman shows us that poor acting from a talented actress is possible with the right (or wrong) director. Oh, there are plenty of pretty visuals, pew pew spaceships, battles etc but you knew that already."
"Apr 12, 2014",1,Unwatchable... The hyperbole about this movie is all true... Now this is pod racing :(
"Apr 12, 2014",2,"Extremely joyless. I only experienced all the Star Wars now in my 20s. Not as miserable as everyone thinks, but nothing I would ever put myself through again. If racism and extensive Congress-esque scenes are your things, then you'll really like this one."
"Apr 11, 2014",2.5,"Bad guy is so cool, but this script ruins the franchise."
"Apr 09, 2014",1.5,"This movie is known for being the most disappointing film in the series. In my mind, the general IDEA of the plot was actually good: the 2 Jedi save a Queen on Naboo, get stranded on Tatooine while trying to fly her to the Jedi Temple, meet Anakin, bring him to be trained, then go back to Naboo to reclaim it and fight Darth Maul. That's pretty cool. Unfortunately, the way all this happens is extremely lame. The film lacks focus. There is too much emphasis on politics and CGI and not enough on the characters or what they're thinking. Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul all seemed like they should be really cool, but there wasn't many, if any, scenes where we really get to see them as characters, and by the end of the film we really don't know much more about them than we did at the beginning. Of course, there was also ""little Ani"", Watto, and especially the reviled Jar Jar Binks, who all annoyed me as much as they did anyone. But when you think about it, without them annoying you, there would be nothing to distract you from how bland this movie is."
"Apr 07, 2014",3.5,I didn't think it was that bad of a film.
"Apr 03, 2014",1.5,The Lego Star Wars game was the only thing that made this movie good
"Apr 02, 2014",2.5,"There's a great movie in this, but it's lost due to silly and crude humor and bland performances."
"Apr 01, 2014",4,"This movie is not bad, in fact this movie is a BILLION times better than those god awful Star Trek movies because at least Star Wars is entertaining and WATCHABLE!!!! The bad guy, Darth maul was awesome. The special effects was awesome too and good acting too."
"Mar 28, 2014",3,"It doesn't have that brilliant Star Wars level or feel to it, but it's still decent."
"Mar 27, 2014",2,"All the magic has been lost and replaced with dazzling but unnecessary CGI effects. The music's still superb, but everything else is a major step down. To add insult to injury, the film contains quite possibly the most annoying character in blockbuster history. And no, it's not Jar Jar."
"Mar 24, 2014",2,"This movie was the worst movie of the saga and was one of Lucas' worst. With racial characters, crappy script, podracing that was only in this to make a bunch of knockoff video games,  ok cast (that was ruined by the script) and a decent plot. This movie did not meet up to Star Wars' potential. This also lowered the expectations for the rest of the Star Wars movies. Hopefully Star Wars 7 will refresh the saga and the rest of the Star Wars movies and bring them closer together."
"Mar 22, 2014",3,A fun addition to the series.
"Mar 18, 2014",3,"When I saw this film in theaters as an eight year old, I'm not gonna lie - I loved it. Absolutely loved it. In fact around that age it was my favorite Star Wars film for a while.
Now that I'm older, I've wised up, and this film has certainly gone down several pegs. The plot has little to no focus, the dialogue is pretty weak, and some of the acting is sub-par.
But I still defend this film on the basis that it is strangely ideal as a kid's Star Wars film. When I was that age, I didn't care that the plot was all over the place. What I cared about was how constantly exciting and dazzling it was. I was willing to take a break from the main plot to watch a completely unrelated pod-race, because I found it entertaining. And Darth Maul had a double lightsaber. Need I go on?
As a follow-up to the original Trilogy, which not only was exciting and thrilling but also had characters and moments of tension and buildup to make it compelling for multiple viewings, this film failed. It didn't maintain the broad appeal of the original. But on its own merits, for a young audience, it's exciting, creative and enjoyable - and as an adult, I still regard it as a nostalgic guilty pleasure. Just don't expect reruns on Turner Classic Movies anytime soon."
"Mar 15, 2014",5,"4.5 stars.


The movie is good.  But the acting isn't the best.  I don't know why most of the reviews are very bad.  Well, it is their opinion, so I don't care.  But I didn't hate it.  Still, it was pretty good.  But the part with Darth Maul duel was very sad and may scare toddlers and babies."
"Mar 14, 2014",2.5,"By all means this film isn't horrendous or boring in any way, in fact it looks incredible. It's just an unnecessary movie with a dumb, mindless storyline."
"Mar 13, 2014",5,My favourite Star Wars of all time!!!
"Mar 13, 2014",4,"This was the first Star Wars film I saw, so obviously I was much more prone to liking it than a fan of the original Trilogy, and I did!"
"Mar 13, 2014",1.5,"This movie is just an incoherent mess! There's no clear main character, the story made no sense whatsoever, the characters were idiots and have no depth to them, the acting was terrible, the effects were lazy, I couldn't get invested into these 'action scenes, and (UGH!) don't even get me started on Jar Jar Binks! If I could say anything positive about The Phantom Menace, it would be that I thought the pod racing scene was pretty cool and so was Darth Maul, and John Williams' music score was really good. Other than that, I didn't like ANYTHING out of this sci-fi snoozefest! My overall rating is a 3/10."
"Mar 12, 2014",4.5,"The one criticism that I somewhat feel mixed about is the midhi-clorians. People feel like it takes away The Force from everyone, and only people with more-pure blood can be special. I like that there is some attempt at a scientifical explanation, but at the same time they state every life-form has midhi-clorians and is more about clarity of mind and soul. Which paradoxical makes the point and also defies the point at the same time.

The pod racing scene is good, is good that the movie walks away from the war and shoes us some Star Wars alien culture. That's what made Lucas universe believable in the first place.

I liked the planet Naboo, and particularly how even the characters in the movie are annoyed by Jar Jar's lack of self-control antics, I feel Jar Jar succeeded as a character because you were supposed to be annoyed by him. I do believe there is some truth to the theories  of a dropped antagonistic Jar Jar storyline (because people hated Jar Jar).

I liked the silent hitman like Sith that Darth Maul is. Even if I wish he had been the developed character that the cartoons made him; but without considering that Maul is more a plot device than a character. However along the cool design; Ray Park really elevates it to a character on well done, body language and stunts.

Qui-jon is the most interesting character and I wish his conflict with Yoda and the Jedi, as well as his friendship with sequel Count Dokuu had been explored more.

The Palpatine and laws and politics scenes are criticized, but I feel that showing how the Republic doesn't care for third world planets like Tatooine slavery is good at showing the hipocrisy of the world we live in. And creates the unseen Anakin grudge into something really believable."
"Mar 08, 2014",2.5,Not a very good one. This movie does not fit in the saga.
"Mar 07, 2014",3.5,"Good start to the prequel trilogy. I saw this in 3-D, and was a little disappointed by the fact that a lot of scenes were in 2-D."
"Mar 07, 2014",2,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is the first film in the space opera's chronology, but the fourth film to be released.  The hype leading up to its arrival was unparalleled: the very thought of a new Star Wars movie blew everyone's minds.  The trailers looked good, too: the special effects were amazing, the action was outstanding, and John Williams's score was simply beautiful.
   Then the movie came out, and it was bad.  And it wasn't because people had built up their expectations too much.  No, the movie was actually boring, stilted, boring, annoying, and boring. 
   But how could a Star Wars film be boring?  This is the grandest of tales, the greatest of all film sagas! Given that the plot of the prequel trilogy was pretty much laid out, what could George Lucas have done to make a terrible movie that was nearly impossible to mess up?
   The first step is to, of course, focus on trade routes and a blockade of the planet Naboo conducted by some weird aliens who are not only grossly incompetent, but have hilariously bad Asian accents.  Things get lively when two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), interrupt the proceedings and screw up the bad guys' plans.
   When the first lightsaber is ignited and John Williams's famous anthem bursts in, there's a moment of hope that the opening minutes of the film are a misstep.  Alas, they are not, for the enemy army, composed of useless robots, falls easily and poses no threat to the Jedi.  All action and no tension make The Phantom Menace a very dull film.
   The rest of the film's plot is a jumbled mess, and a lot of the acting is phoned-in, especially by Natalie Portman, who plays Queen Amidala, the 14-year old ruler of Naboo (yeah, that's just as stupid as it sounds).  The film's greatest tragedy, though, is Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who is apparently the main character but has much less screen time than Liam Neeson.  Lloyd was clearly not prepared to take this role, and though he was just a boy at the time, everything about his performance is cringeworthy.   
   The Phantom Menace is disappointingly short on character development, and the little that we get is either good or bad.  For scenes such as Obi-Wan's coming into his role as Anakin's master, we also get poorly acted and scripted moments like Anakin's parting from his mother.
   The film's special effects are its saving grace, and they are used effectively.  The overlong pod racing sequence, for example, is still a fantastic feast for the eyes.  George Lucas continues to build imaginative worlds and knows how to frame his action scenes; he definitely has a knack for giving us iconic shots.  The final lightsaber duel between the two Jedi and the menacing main antagonist, Darth Maul (Ray Park), is thrilling and fast-paced, truly demonstrating the power of Force users in their prime. If only the rest of the film was as exciting. 

More of my reviews can be found at The Cinephile Realm."
"Mar 05, 2014",1.5,"""You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" - I think Aaron Eckhardt was secretly mentioning George Lucas when he said that bit of dialogue in ""The Dark Knight"". This was where his legacy took a turn for the worse. Once computer-generated imagery came into play, George Lucas got lazy and this is highly evident in this big disappointment. The movie cost more than twice the budgets of the original trilogy to make, yet the effects used in this motion picture look very second rate when you compare them to the original trilogy. The CGI really does stick out like a sore thumb.

The performances are very wooden. However, I cannot blame the people in this movie for tuning out throughout the production. You can tell that they assumed at first that they were going to be part of something great, but it turned out to be not what they thought it was. I really feel sorry for Jake Lloyd, too. Jar Jar Binks was annoying and none of the other characters even did much of anything other than walk around, sit down and talk.

The toilet humor (poop/fart jokes) really has no place in Star Wars. It was almost as if George Lucas was laughing at us being in pain. He was also evidently laughing at us when he had little Anakin accidentally destroy the Federation ship, which had to be one of the biggest insults to sc-fi/fantasy fans alongside when ED-209 was reprogrammed by a little girl in Robocop 3.

I pretty much consider this movie non-canon, alongside the other 2 prequels that tried to be part of the Star Wars universe. Star Wars isn't just about the fighter ships, lightsabers, jedi mind tricks, droids, etc. It is the stories and characters that make it so near and dear to us. You can't just half-ass a grand-scale epic by just making it look cool. The story and characters need to come first before the visuals. Sadly, with this installment, it is the other way around."
"Mar 05, 2014",0.5,Worst of the saga. Too much Jar-Jar and not enough Darth Maul.
"Mar 02, 2014",3.5,"While you're a kid, this movie may look like one of the best movies ever. I consistently watched this and loved every second of it. Jar Jar binks was  one of my favorite characters and it was best Star Wars besides return of the Jedi. Fourteen years later after watching it in the theaters, I watched the movie again as an adult. This movie is a great example of why visuals can't save a movie. Annoying characters, quite bad acting, and consist lake of what made Star Wars Star Wars. Though it being a Star Wars movie, it will never get a rotten rating from me and it will always be a good movie. 7.8/10"
"Mar 02, 2014",3.5,"Definitely among the weakest films, there is still spectacle to be had, and the climactic lightsaber dual is among the series' best."
"Mar 01, 2014",2.5,"Entertainment Monthly; 67% 6.7The computer-driven effects are impressive, but the adventure is hampered by a flat screenplay, dull acting, and just a hint as to why the dark side of the Force will eventually transform cute little Anakin into the evil Darth Vader. This movie lacks interest and entertainment but there are a couple of cool scenes."
"Mar 01, 2014",2,"There was too much going on at the end, the storyline was a little of and that Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character in the series. This movie just did not sink in and as a die hard Star Wars fan I was extremely disappointed."
"Mar 01, 2014",2.5,"man i loved this movie as a kid, but now i see all the problems. the sheer marketing scheme behind so much of this movie just makes me sad. i am part of a newer generation therefore this was the first star wars movie that i saw. it gave me a good impression. then i saw the original trilogy and i was in awe. still, no matter how annoying jar jar binks and anakin skywalker are, no matter how dumb the podrace is, i admit i could still enjoy elements of the movie. qui-gon was my favourite character in the star wars franchise even after seeing the original movies, and i still like him a lot now. all in all, disappointment? sure. terrible? no. 2.5 stars"

Jar jar  had a purpose, but he was annoying and could have been better thought out. Anakin should have been older, or at least had better dialogue, however I still enjoyed his spirit, and they made him kind of a badass (how many nine year olds can pilot a spacecraft and a pod racer?) . The politics were necessary and I quite enjoyed them, but the parts where they discussed the politics were too concentrated into one period of the movie making you desperate for some action. However the story is pretty awesome, and the action was legendary. Liam Neeson as Qui gon Jin and Ray Park's Darth Maul made this movie."

Star Wars the Phantom Menace is quite possibly the hardest movie to review ever. Why? Because literally everything has been said about it. There are tonnes of reviews of this movie, even reviews that say how this film could have been rewritten. The Phantom Menace is a dull, boring and sporadically entertaining movie. The acting in this movie is all over the place. Liam Neeson is a great actor but here he's fairly underwhelming, he doesn't really put much emotion into his performance and Qui-Gon is a boring character, for a lead character he's incredibly dull, his only real character trait is he's stern. Ewan McGregor is okay, like a lot of the actors in this movie he doesn't read his lines that well at times but he's decent, however he has so little to do, he spends around half the movie in a ship. Natalie Portman is okay, she's a great actress but this is far from her best, I really hate the dubbed voice she has in this film. Jake Lloyd the poor guy, you really have to feel bad for the guy, this film basically destroyed his acting career and he hasn't been in a movie for around 10 or so years. True his performance is pretty awful, but he was a kid and it's very rare you get a great kid actor. I blame the script more because no one in this film reads their lines with any emotion. Samuel L Jackson, Ian McDiarmid and Terrence Stamp are all wasted in this movie. Frank Oz is barely in the film also. The best character without a doubt is Darth Maul. He has about two lines and he's a badass and the best villain of the prequel trilogy. This film has absolutely no tension, the dull battledroids provide absolutely no tension, whenever I Obi Wan and Qui-Gon fight the droids there is no tension as they cut them down so easily. The final fight also has no tension, as I know Obi Wan will survive and I don't care what happens to Qui-Gon. The script for this film is dreadful, all the lines are clunky, boring and all the characters have no emotion when they read their lines. George Lucas does a really bad job directing. He was obviously more interested in the cgi than the actual movie. Speaking of which the cgi is not aging very well, a lot of the cgi looks extremely dated. The stuff in space still looks really good, but the rest of the cgi looks pretty crap especially when Jabba the Hut turns up, he looks abismal. The cgi in the fight on Jar Jar Binks planet looks really bad. Speaking of Jar Jar Binks I hate him, just like everyone else, I don't really have a lot to say about him but he's annoying as fuck. The biggest problem with this film is that it's just so boring. The scenes with the political arguments are so ridiculously boring, as are the scenes with the Jedi council. This film is overlong and just gets so dull. The scenes on Tatooine are alright. The stupid blue fly thing is so annoying and gives me a headache. There are also some more ridiculously bad kid actors. Whenever Anakin and his friend were talking I was just thinking, where did George Lucas find these kids? The pod race scene was my favourite part of the movie when I was younger, but now while I do still find it fairly entertaining it's quite overlong and repetitive, however when you get to the pod race it's good to see something fairly entertaining happening. The finale of this film is a mixed bag. It's great to see some action after the boring political scenes. There is just simply too much going on in this ending action sequence. I love the fight between Obi Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul is amazing, it's brilliantly well done, there's some gorgeous imagery and John Williams song Dual of the Fates goes amazingly with the fight sequence. Although the pay off with Darth Maul is a bit underwhelming and in some bits it obvious the actors are trying to hit each other's light sabers. The action sequence with Padme and the soldiers shooting the droids and trying to get to the control room is pretty good. Young Anakin accidentally blowing up the empire ship is awful. The scene is so badly done and I hate some of the lines they give Jake Lloyd and the cgi looks really bad in this scene. The fight with Jar Jar and his people against the droids is really bad, it's dull, I don't care who wins and again the cgi looks bad. I think George Lucas made a huge mistake by not ending the film with Qui-Gon's funeral. The film ends with this stupid parade scene, it should have ended with the funeral as Yoda and Mace Windu's line would have been a great line to end the film on. Overall the Phantom Menace is a dull, boring and very dissapointing movie. It has good elements but overall it's very mediocre. I don't hate it, it's not the worst movie of all time but it's is really bad. C"

Menace has some interesting visuals and no shortage of fanboner bait, but ultimately, when you put George Lucas in a sterile blue room with a bunch of actors who care nothing about what's in the bland lines of a shitty script, you get a fecal matter cash grab."
"Feb 14, 2014",4,The best sw movie of all time.
"Feb 14, 2014",2,Darth Maul is the best part of this movie. Hands down. The rest of the movie can go back to Sesame Street. This boring attempt to widen the Star Wars universe was horrible. It's long and dumb. Just a childs movie.
"Feb 14, 2014",3.5,"Pod racing, darth maul and Liam Neeson make this easily the best of the prequel films.... Jar Jar is annoying??? Did anyone see Hayden Christiansen in the other two?? THAT is annoying."
"Feb 10, 2014",3.5,A ok movie a 73% by Aidan
"Feb 07, 2014",1.5,I expect more from Star Wars.  Special effects and action sequences aren't enough.
"Feb 05, 2014",3.5,"Underrated film. Jar Jar is freaking annoying, but for the first modern Star Wars film, it is a fun movie every once in a while."
"Feb 04, 2014",4,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is not a bad movie, it just does not live up to anything done in the original trilogy making it a disappointment. The plot was a little over complicated with the senate and mediclorins, but the movie made sense and followed a pretty good story. The real reason this movie is considered ""bad"" is because of the unnecessary characters and miscasts. The Gungans were not all that terrible until it came to Jar Jar Binks. As soon as he grabbed hold of Qui-Gon, Jar Jar became the most hated thing in any Star Wars movie ever. The Gungans do not kill the movie as side characters, but with Jar Jar in the entire movie, the Gungan language and Jar Jar's annoying voice kill every scene he is in. Jake Lloyd was also the other miscasting as young Anikan Skywalker, but he does not nearly receive as much hate as Jar Jar. This movie outweighed the bad with the good bringing in Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan, and the addition of one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars Universe Darth Maul. While this movie does have its occasional plot flaws, and some incredibly annoying side characters, a die-hard Star Wars fan, like me, will enjoy it enough to not completely dislike it. Overall I give Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace a 8.3/10."
"Feb 03, 2014",3.5,"I may be biased as it's the first Star Wars I saw, and the first movie I remember seeing in a cinema, but for me, although obviously pandering to a younger generation, this was a solid movie.
Plus, Liam Neeson is in it."

"Jan 27, 2014",3.5,"This movie over all I think is a pretty good movie. But it had a few things that was wrong with it Jar Jar Binks obviously but also the kid that played Anakin was absolutely horrible it was one of those things where your watching it and your feeling embarssed for him. Say what you want about hayden but he wasn't nearly as bad as that kid. but the cool things make up for it. Obi wan, Qui-gon, and DARTH MAUL are awesome. although I wish darth was in the other 2 ;/"

"Jan 23, 2014",2,"Despite some really impressive action sequences, a once again great score by John Williams and not too bad acting from Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson the movie as a whole is EXTREMELY dull."

"Jan 23, 2014",2.5,The Phantom Menace is entertaining fun with fantastic visuals and stunts but overall lacks character substance to live up to its franchise's reputation
"Jan 22, 2014",1.5,"The film that ruined so many childhoods, it's hard not to see why everyone derides the horrible acting, writing, and direction as well as the nonsensical story, because it's all very truthfully horrible"
"Jan 22, 2014",2,"Although this movie did not disappoint me as a child, I can see now how much George Lucas payed more attention on creating characters that were only there for bland reasons, but still not a bomb of a movie in my opinion..."
"Jan 21, 2014",3,"Doesn't have a Star Wars feel to it, but it's still a necessary movie."
"Jan 21, 2014",2,"A strong performance by Liam Neeson and some great visuals, but the film gets extremely bogged down by beurocratic nonsense, unconvincing dialogue, and a very miscast Jake Lloyd as Anakin."
"Jan 18, 2014",4,"Fun, if not reaching."
"Jan 18, 2014",2.5,While it's visually entertaining the big problem of The Phantom Menace is a lack of focus on the plot and character development
"Jan 16, 2014",5,AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!
"Jan 16, 2014",4,"While it is not as good as the films that came before it (yet are somehow after it), it is still a pleasure to watch. I am in the minority with this, i know, but I don't find Jar Jar annoying, I don't think the acting is terrible, and I don't think it deserves all the hate. The reason the score is not higher is because of the climax constantly switching between three fronts. Besides that, it serves as a great start to the six Star Wars movies."
"Jan 14, 2014",0.5,"Well to be honest they're all pretty rubbish, but this this one sinks in cinema quicksand without a single breath of either creativity, quality acting or directing and contains possibly the worst scripting yet seen. Money was no doubt no issue, neither was a semblance of coherence"
"Jan 14, 2014",0.5,"Story: Not a star wars movie. Who cares about intergalactic trade negotiations. 
Acting: Liam Neeson is horribly miscast. Jake Lloyd is seriously awful. Ewan McGregor tries, but the script is so bad that his efforts are wasted 
Action: Terribly uninteresting. Darth Maul is pretty cool and the pod races are pretty interesting but otherwise it's just boring. Seriously though, after Qui-Gon is killed and Obi-Wan is released, that fight scene is fucking awesome 
Visuals: Awful. It looks like it was filmed on a green screen because everything looks off kilter
All in all, this is a disjointed piece of shit that will probably never be watched again"
"Jan 12, 2014",4,Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace delivers a great amount of action and delivers a great script. Although it is a bit rough around the edges I give this movie a 4 star rating.

"Jan 09, 2014",0.5,God-damn you George Lucas and jar jar binks
"Jan 06, 2014",2.5,"**The following review/rant for Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, shall stand as an opinionated inclusion of its succeeding films, Attack of the Clones (2002) and Revenge of the Sith (2005). A three-in-one review if you will.**


I would have walked into the theatre at the age of six when I did see Star Wars Ep.1...and yes, thankfully I did see Episodes 4 through 6 before I became ""tainted"". That being said, at the age of six, I will admit whole-heartedly that I loved every second of this film and was instantly enthralled with all aspects of the eye-candy thrown up in front of me. Seeing it again fourteen years later, not so much.

The film held up as a visual accomplishment for its time; it does deserve the recognition for that I have to say. The production design and conceptualized development of such a vast universe was a highlight. I do have to turn around and say the opposite however, ""Sometimes less is more."" There comes a time, as early as the first 10minutes, where you will notice there is a considerable amount of crap thrown in to show off its visual accomplishments. There is so much crap that it clouds any salvageable pieces of a ""good"" plot and any really interesting characters. It acts as almost an insult to the masterful practical effects in the original half of the saga that initiated the creation of a kingdom for Lucas.

**SPOILER ALERT**
What am I saying, JAR JAR BINKS RUINED EVERYTHING! There, I said it. We were all thinking it. The elephant has been addressed and its front paw is now crushing down on Binks' head. 

I am uncertain if Jar Jar was thrown in to get the kids involved along with a few uncomfortable laughs, or that Lucas really just wanted to dumb us and the franchise down a bit. I mean, think about it. The babbling, bumbling, stumbling idiot we all felt uncomfortable watching in the first episode, transitions into being the idiot on the Senate responsible for the rise of the Galactic Empire. Seriously Lucas? If you don't know what I am talking about by the way, see Episode 2 again or save the time and google it. Jar Jar Binks legitimately motions to give Chancellor Palpetine the emergency powers he uses to overthrow, well, everything. If it is supposed to go beyond that, it didn't work because that's what I picked up from the screen. Although, thinking back on it, I suppose it's really Padme's fault...she did give permission for 'ol Jar Jar to represent her in the Senate while she was away. Suddenly I don't feel so bad about her death. Oh well, we've come too far to back track. The point is,  the senate and Jar Jar are poorly constructed plot devices used to push the story forward; hugely poorly constructed plot devices if I can say that? The creation of Jar Jar Binks ruined a lot of things and downplayed half of a saga. 

You may be wondering why I am allowing one character to impose a bias for the other two films. Well, that's because once you realize it, everything else feels so pointless and you die a little on the inside...okay, a lot. It breaks your inner fan-boy. I can't stress enough that it downplays an entire saga, that when first created with episode four, blew audiences away and struck them dead-center in the heart. 

Overall, Star Wars Episodes 1 through 3 were feats in their own ways whether you like it or not. The epic Jedi battle on Geonosis and Yoda hoping around with a lightsaber, being all badass, were memorable moments. Your inner fan-boy definitely kicks in at those times. That being said, there is no comparison to the original half of the saga (4-6), not even in the slightest in my opinion. Episodes 1 through 3 were lucky they had the privilege, though abused, of relying on a truly enticing universe started twenty-two years before. I do give praise to Lucas for opening our eyes to an expansive and ambitious saga that has spawned into a universal legacy. Not bad for a space opera! Enjoy!"
"Jan 06, 2014",3,The story is just boring but Darth Maul is so cool!!!!! Jar Jar Binks sucks.
"Jan 06, 2014",3,"Finally at 25 I decided it's time to fulfill one of the many lacks I have as a cinema lover, and watch all the 6 star wars. I will go from 1 to 6 and not from 4 to 6 and then from 1 to 3, although I think it will be hard to go back from the 2000's CGI to the 1970's one. 
The first film haven't impressed me. The first hour seems a movie for kids, and not of the bests. I was a bit bored, but in the end the final part was much better and took me more, but I hope it will get even much better, otherwise I would be disappointed.
PS: I didn't read any review before writing my own, but I'm glad to discover that most of the doubts I had both on characters (specifically on Jar Jar Binks) and on the plot are higly shared also by a lot of critics and a big part of the public. Margin note: it's the first time that I like a character portrayed by Liam Neeson (except for his role in Schlinder's List) and I feel pity when something bad happens to him."
"Jan 05, 2014",1,"A terrible movie. Just does not make sense. The kid Anakin acting is a debacle.  The only half decent part of this movie is the lightsaber fight, but does not save this film from its disgraceful state."
"Jan 04, 2014",2.5,"Although there was enjoyment to be found in this movie, such as the Darth Maul lightsabre battle, the majority of the film feels dull due to the irritating scenes with JarJar Binks and the bland characters."
"Jan 03, 2014",3,Too childish and the plot too thin.
"Jan 03, 2014",2.5,This movie is just OK. IMO
"Jan 03, 2014",2.5,"Il film ha due pecche grosse a mio avviso: la regia poco ispirata: ci sono poche inquadrature che ti lasciano dire ""che figata"", uno di quelli riusciti e' la scena in cui i robot escono dai loro container e si ""spacchettano"" prima di iniziare la battaglia su Naboo. E la sceneggiatura che si divide in momenti divertenti per i bambini (personaggi che cadono tipo su bucce di banana et simila) e momenti in cui si discute senza concludere molto (tra l'altro spesso questi momenti non venivano spezzati da scene di battaglia ma da altri momenti lenti e parlati). I personaggi (come Darth Maul) sono abbastanza iconici e pure le scenografie dei luoghi di fantasia sono spettacolari ma vengono sprecate dal regista che ha messo tutto questo in un film poco ispirato."
"Jan 02, 2014",3.5,Cheesiness   (12)    OWN VHS
"Jan 02, 2014",3,Not bad still interesting.
"Jan 02, 2014",3.5,"Pretty good movie but a bit slow at times. I like Star Wars in general so that's also a part of it. The actor for Anakin wasn't the best but he was good enough I think. Jar Jar Binks made me laugh too but sometimes there was too much of his weirdness. Lot of great action scenes near the beginning and the end and scattered throughout a bit. (Especially the duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn against Darth Maul) Some of the action scenes were a bit funny as well which made it a bit more enjoyable. I thought the podrace was very cool and exciting and unique too and the sound effects added to that uniqueness as well. I also watched it on Blu-ray which made it much more cool and exciting. I don't think it's my favourite but it's sometimes hard to compare to the other ones because of each one having unique characters and elements and other things that make each one cool in their own way. Also, Star Wars itself being pretty unique and different added to the experience as well. I don't think you'll regret watching this movie, but if you do, it may be because of the non-interest, non-experience or non-being used to Star Wars or this type of movie and I think knowing more about what's in the movie will make it more enjoyable also. I didn't regret watching it however and thought it was pretty cool. Hope you do too. (Well, anyone who might happen to read this.)"
"Dec 30, 2013",3.5,"Yes I understand there's about 1000 things wrong with this film and it wasn't worth the weight. But regardless of that I still enjoyed this movie, due to it's impressive special effects and some cool star wars moments"
"Dec 29, 2013",3,"When The Phantom Menace was announced, fan frenzy began and anticipation soared high. They were all let down when it was released. The story begins hence when two jedi knights encounter a young boy who may bring balance to the 'Force', as they prepare to face off against the long dormant Sith who seek to reclaim their old glory. Lucas brings out the worst side of the Star Wars saga, the commercial side, and little of the original creativity that had had such a long lasting effect and received neverending love from the fans. In reality, it is relatively entertaining, but its childishness and propensity for obviousness does little to forgive its existence."
"Dec 28, 2013",2,"Awful.. I know this made a ton of money but it was just bad.. A whole lot of nothing. The worst part.. Darth Maul is super cool.. love the look, and the unique light saber.. yet he doesn't get to make a second movie appearance? WTF??"
"Dec 27, 2013",1.5,"This movie is just embarrassing. The plot is stupid, the acting is close to terrible, it feels boring and bland, oh, and what was Lucas thinking when he added Jar Jar Binks? What? If it weren't for an exciting ending, and good visuals, this would be a one star movie."
"Dec 27, 2013",1,Besides the introductions of r2 and 3po I literally cannot find something positive to say about this movie.
"Dec 26, 2013",1,I'm starting to wonder if George Lucas was drunk when he wrote this or did he forgotten how he made Star Wars so awesome
"Dec 23, 2013",3,"Deja 14 ans ! Et ca se sent dans certaines scenes ou les sfx font assez ""plastiques"" et ce, meme en bluray. Etonnant. 
Le film quant a lui est loin d'etre le plus interessant de la saga mais Lucas prend le temps de poser les bases. 
On regrettera la trop forte presence de Jar Jar Binks qui agace au plus au point."
"Dec 23, 2013",1.5,It's cinematic junk food
"Dec 21, 2013",5,Forget Jar Jar and it's pure magic. He looks dated but the rest of the film holds up.
"Dec 20, 2013",3,"The Star Wars movies are all fantastic in their own way, but this movie is one of if not the worst of the six episodes currently out. Silly characters and childish humor ruined many parts of it, but at the same time it was a nice addition to the story. It gets better and we know that so this one is still a must see movie. Come on, everyone has to experience Star Wars!"
"Dec 19, 2013",3,"Has some great scenes and characters, but is SORLEY weighed down by the shitty ones."
"Dec 19, 2013",3.5,"The only dialogs and characters 'The Craptom Menace' successfully did manage to deliver are the droid's. The rest are awful as they are shit. But this shit is what I grew up to love and still does (somewhat).

In the last few years of the past millennium came several big blockbusters that eventually changed the movie industry. The CGI-era was introduced with several big blockbusters like 'Jurassic Park' and 'Independence Day'. But in 1999 a prequel installment of one of the most successful movie franchise's got a new flick that was going to spot new insides to several big, and world famous characters. 'Star Wars' was back and it arrived with glamorous and ambitious effects that was way ahead of its time. But was it a good movie? Was the man named George Lucas still up for the job? Fans of the original films were disappointed and still are, even though it has been more than 15 years since. But it still managed to inspire a new generation of fans, like myself, to this universe that takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. 

Today; I'm still not sure if this is a somewhat good or a bad movie. I grew up with this space-opera and it still got a place in my heart. But as every kid eventually must face, it's the flaws you will notice as a grown up. 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' is a movie full of stupid and hilarious flaws that I'm still stunned how they could have missed it. First of all; lets start with the plot. 'The Phantom Menace' is as the title says, a mysterious first entry into the franchise. But lets stop right there; what is the plot really? The Trade Federation made a blockade, the Jedi try to negotiate, war, etc. But why all this? There are many explanations like that ""Palpatine wanted more power"", etc, but is there a simple summary of the plot? No. The plot isn't simple, thats a big flaw right there. The plot isn't that subtle, it keeps going, and it therefore often is very unpredictable (which is a good thing). But much of the story is very vaguely written. Add a stupid amount of plot-holes and tonnes of silliness too; then you got 'The Phantom Menace'. Examples like why didn't The Trade Federation land directly near the main city instead of the other side of the planet? Where did the blockade go when the main characters got back to Naboo? Other examples are too many to mention, but the fact that Darth Vader built C-3P0 is just too much; yeah to help Shmi Skywalker with what? The Dishes? Cleaning? Haha yeah right. George Lucas got a great feel for adding stupid and non-important subplots that just do more harm than good. The plot continues and we arrive on Tatooine where a cool and really entertaining podrace takes place. But this is 'Star Wars', and I'm watching a race. Not a race to death but as in sport. Sure it's the story of Anakin Skywalker and we see him in his younger age as a skilled and powerful pilot, but it's still a race. Is this really a prequel to the 'Star Wars' George Lucas once invented? As mentioned; it's a very messy and high-paced flick, which is noticeable near the third act. We see events take place on the ground, up in space and so on. Several, often more than three places at once. The story is so spread out on different locations and on different characters that no emotion nor empathy to them get's real. And speaking of the plot; much of the established plot-details in the original films aren't that respected in this prequel flick (for example; The Midi-chlorians). Other disturbing aspects with the plot are the stupid and illogical decisions many characters keeps making over and over. It doesn't make anything better that many of the film's dialogs are expressed when the characters are sitting down, talking and debating; rather than during intense moments like what we saw in 'The Empire Strikes Back'.

But what about the characters? Who's the main character? That is a pretty simple question but who is it? They got the same flaws as the story, there're too many things going on at the same time. The focus isn't on one specific character and because of that; the whole movie is more of a 'previously' than an origin story. 'The Phantom Menace' should have been so much better if the center of the plot was on one character and one alone, and then develop and focus a great story on that specific individual. Not to add more non-important ones like Jar Jar Binks. Our main characters are on the other hand very well presented, and a very good performance from Liam Neeson! Nathalie Portman however; is very one-dimensional and dry with her dialogs. There's no feel nor any drama to her, she just stands there talking with no humanity nor feel to her. Smaller acting-roles are kinda the same; many look stressed and overly hyped just because they are in a 'Star Wars' movie. Many characters therefor often feel forced to the specific situation. When it comes to the characters, are there not that much depth nor backstory to them. We don't really know that much about them and they don't impress that much if you must compare to the original films. The only ones that do are R2-D2 and C-3P0, which is sad because they are droids. The only characters George Lucas successfully made look real and understandable are the droids, not the humans. Jar Jar Binks have always been a big discussion. Does he really have a purpose? Not really, but why is he in the movie then? Well Star Wars have always had some childish aspects. R2-D2 is a cute little droid, Yoda is a funny little alien and Ewoks are cute small bears. If we look at Star Wars from a child-perspective and what the younger audience like; then it's very understandable why Jar Jar is in this movie. But from a story-viewpoint, does he really have a purpose? The Ewoks, Yoda and R2-D2 all got a major role in the original films, but what about Jar Jar? He doesn't have a purpose, he's just a puppet for the kids, just like the Ewoks. The only difference is that the Ewoks actually had a purpose in the story, they weren't just a marketing tool.

The plot is as mentioned very high-paced, which I've grown up to love with its space-opera and action. But it might be a ""too plot centered"" movie. Just look at the characters; how much interactions and emotion are there between different characters - that doesn't have anything with the plot to do? Not that much. We don't get to know them nor get to understand them. It's just about the story, and to introduce the first entry of this chronological franchise. Our main protagonist Darth Maul is another good example. He's a very mysterious, cool and badass villain, but how much do we know about him? How much does he say? Nothing really. There's no feel, chemistry nor understanding to him. He's just a baddie.

With characters comes great dialogs, but not in this case. One aspect of these prequel-films are the incredibly forced moments where characters must show their emotion and what they see and think through dialogs. It's the same with facts and plot-details, they often express it in a such forced and obvious way. Many dialogs are unnecessary too, we know stuff, but they say it anyway. This is something all the three prequel films got. There are full of unnecessary and crappy narrative exposition-dialogs! But some are on the other hand surprisingly complex and even deep, but there aren't that much of them. Look at the main protagonist and antagonist when they are confronting each other; how much interaction do they have on an emotional level? Do they interact? Do they talk? That's the sad truth about this movie, they just fight for their cause and we just hang along with no understanding why or what their motivations are. This is something the original films got a lot of.

This was supposed to be the origin story of legendary characters like Darth Vader and Obi-wan Kenobi, but what is 'The Phantom Menace' really? It's definitely a movie of many flaws, but it still got some positivity. I've always loved all the action, space-opera, battles, sound effects, music, cinematography and of course the overall adventures of the main antagonists. The main lead from Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are somewhat solid but of course not that deep or relatable. The CGI are on the other hand very mind-blowing for a movie that came out over 15 years ago, and that still does hold up or even exceeds todays standards (even though some elements are pretty vague). I've always loved this movie, and I still do. Yes, I'm overly entertained by a shitty movie that shouldn't be okay to like at all. But this was my first entry to the galaxy far, far away as a kid, and it still got a place in my heart. But it still is a pretty awful movie from a critical viewpoint; with horrible dialogs, one-dimensional characters, vague story and a less 'Star Wars-ish' (prequel) continuation. Add childish humor with fart and poop jokes and too-many-to-mention accidental save the day-moments; welcome to 'The Craptom Menace'.

Personal rating 75/100 Great!
Critical rating: 42/100 Bad!"
"Dec 16, 2013",0.5,"If this movie had nothing to do with the original trilogy, i may have liked it more, but the let down after watching the older movies first was great. This movie was poorly acted, horribly plotted, extremely boring and seemed to be more aimed at kids then any of the other movies. Oh I almost forgot: Jar Jar Binks"
"Dec 14, 2013",3,That little kid as Anakin sucks.
"Dec 13, 2013",2.5,There are moments I enjoy and moments that I hate!
"Dec 11, 2013",0.5,"When I watch this film I do not know who is the main character. That is the first of many problems. I could go on and on about how this film is too much exposition, and how it creates an uninteresting story, but honestly it has been said. This is just a film that is really bad, and really disappointing."
"Dec 10, 2013",2.5,"What a money grubbing rip off! Lucas was even being lazy on the plot, the prequel was absolutely unnecessary, I really couldn't care less about Anakin Skywalker's back story, the race was pointless. What really bugged me was the introduction of Jar Jar Binks, the worst character in the entire franchise.There was stunning visual effects, sure, but the dialogues and acting were so bad, I wanted to cry."
"Dec 08, 2013",2,"The Phantom Menace is very disappointing. For any fan of the original series, this is a real letdown. I had a hard time learning who the intended audience was. The plot revolves around some trade federation hold up and politics, so it can't be for kids. Yet everything wrong with this movie can be summed up in three words, Jar-Jar Binks. He is the ""comic relief"" that I did not laugh at once, and was the humor for kids? Cause if the film is about politics, I don't think it is? Back to Jar-Jar, who was the most annoying character ever put to film. All his lame jokes made me want one of the jedis to cut his head off (why did they let him come with anyway?) The dialogue needs much work, and the narrative is highly unfocused. It's not all bad though, the final fight is unbelievably entertaining, which is the reason I'm giving this a little higher of a score than it deserves. There is some good acting, fun action, and a fast plot to keep one entertained. The villain is cool, and some of the actors are good. Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace gets 2/5 stars (C-)."
"Dec 08, 2013",1,"Such a disappointment, so many problems. First why do all characters have to be interwoven, Darth Vader as a child made CP3O etc but he nevers remembers making him. Also if this is set before Start Wars 4 why do all the ships look so much more impressive, I know CGI allowed Lucas to create stunning looking ships, but fast forward 25 years in Star wars world and ships have all gone backwards. The dialogue is woeful and the movie just jumps from scene to scene like some good awful comic. All in all a major chance missed. Plus Jar Jar Blinks, God what was Lucas thinking!"
"Dec 08, 2013",4,"Everyone disses the movie because it was kinda childish,  but it brought in a new generation of fans. so i love it."

"Nov 18, 2013",2.5,"*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN DRIVE SEAL*

Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I've always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with ""The Phantom Menace"" is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he's just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.

For one thing, this project is limited by the fact that anyone familiar with the first trilogy knows the story's outcome, and it therefore lacks some of the suspense associated with a gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, this situation leaves Lucas with very little freedom as a storyteller. It also encourages him to gloss over key events; because their outcome is a foregone conclusion, he forgets to bring them to life.

For example, we know there will eventually be a romance between Anakin and Padme. So Lucas has the two characters meet here and--surprise, surprise--they seem to like each other. Their developing friendship isn't portrayed that clearly, and their motivations for becoming close aren't explained. Because Lucas fails to make scenes like these believable, we can't help being conscious of how he's manipulating the plot in his effort to connect the two trilogies. Another good example of this problem is Anakin's portrayal as a potential Jedi. There doesn't appear to be anything about this kid remotely out of the ordinary, even though the other characters keep talking like there is. Our only reason for thinking he's special is that the plot requires it.

If the story fails to be engaging, it is because we never see the important events. Lucas makes a fatal error in not showing what's happening on Naboo, the small planet whose capture is the focus of the plot. Numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against the planet's inhabitants, but we only know about this because the characters on screen refer to the events, usually rather woodenly.

The deadpan performances are a problem in themselves, but they only highlight our lack of involvement in the story. Think of Han Solo sweating in fear, then think of the emotional vacuums passing for characters in this film. Whenever any of the characters do express emotion, as in the scene where Anakin and his mom part, it still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages to keep the emotional reactions of his characters to a minimum, which gives the film an almost mechanical feel.

It's true that ""A New Hope"" never showed Alderaan's inhabitants, but we still could feel the tragedy of the planet's destruction through the horrified reactions of Princess Leia and Obi Wan. Moreover, there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly, such as the slaying of rebels at the beginning; the capture and torture of the princess; and the murder of Luke's foster parents. Furthermore, the major plot elements were intriguing in and of themselves. They weren't there merely to show us how they were to be linked to later events, which seems to be the case with the new film.

I suspect that Lucas was not as concerned in the first trilogy with what had to happen later in the story and was therefore able to focus his attention on the events at hand. The weakest segment was ""Return of the Jedi,"" which had the task of bringing the story to an end. Only then did Lucas start to show signs of forcing plot points. In ""The Phantom Menace,"" he gets so bogged down in the task of bringing his story from point A to point B that he ends up with only the bare bones of a plot, and none of it comes alive.

This is especially true of the characterization. In the old trilogy, characters like Yoda and Han reveal distinct personalities in their first few minutes on screen. This film goes for more than two hours and the characters, including the familiar ones, come off vague and nondescript. We aren't given much of a chance to experience their personalities in the way they interact. We must take Qui Gon's word for it when he describes Obi Wan as ""headstrong."" What's most odd is that the cartoons seem better developed than the humans. The scenes where Qui Gon negotiates with the birdlike slave-owner Watto are amusing and well-done--probably the movie's best scenes aside from the stunning action sequences--but they can't hold a candle to the constant interactions throughout the first trilogy.

One thing I cannot do is accuse the film of lacking creativity. The design of the creatures, the technologies, and the planets is impressive. Watching the film is sort of like reading a children's book that isn't very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations. There is certainly a ""wow"" factor in the movie's visuals, but the effect of it is short-lived.

I get irked when I hear fans talk as though the ""Star Wars"" movies were never about anything beyond special effects. While the inventive visuals are part of what made the originals so revolutionary, they're not what made the films so fun to watch. And in no way can they explain the trilogy's continuing popularity today. After all, many of the original effects look primitive by today's standards, and their novelty has certainly worn off. Only an enduring and compelling storyline could have allowed the first three films to become the classics they're almost universally acknowledged to be."
"Nov 17, 2013",4,"Si bien esta película no es perfecta, pero cumple bien su objetivo de enfocarnos en una época de diplomacia y orden galáctico antes de la dictadura oscura que todos conocemos. Aplican debates políticos que si lo piensan bien, son inútiles y una perdedera de tiempo tremenda, además de algunas pocas incoherencias que pueden pasarse por alto, pero otras que son simplemente reprochables. Hubiese estado mejor si hubiesen explicado mejor los orígenes de los Jedi y los Sith antes que meternos en problemas y temas políticos que de seguro a muchos no les importa. Pero del resto la cinta sigue teniendo buena calidad en cuanto a reparto, desarrollo, escenografías, efectos especiales y banda sonora´, además de momentos épicos e icónicos. Un filme fresco de acción y aventuras como solo el mismo George Lucas podría hacer."
"Nov 17, 2013",3,Some generally good effects and intense action sequences can't save this prequel from being a messy hokum of political agendas and silly character concepts.
"Nov 16, 2013",1.5,"While it has its merits in visuals and some action sequences, Phantom Menace ultimately falls flat with unlikable (and sometimes annoying) characters, awful dialogue, and a boring plot"
"Nov 16, 2013",5,My Absolute Favourite Movie!!!
"Nov 15, 2013",3.5,"The Star Wars saga concluded in 1983 and fans were satisfied.  While the origins of Darth Vader seemed like a story worth telling, it would have to be done just right to appease fans.  And while ""The Phantom Menace"" does a lot of things right, it's the things it does wrong that it is best remembered for.

The film has a very muddled plot that jumps from planet to planet without any really cohesion.  ""The Phantom Menace"" slows WAY down in it's second act.  We arrive on Tatooine, a world that we've already seen in two of the other movies, and spend the majority of the movie here.  It's foolish to dwell on it for so long.  The film slows further once we arrive on Coruscant, which is so dull, I lose interest.  Furthermore, Podracing, which the filmmakers undoubtedly thought would reel in the NASCAR crowd, is nothing more than a weak substitute for real action.  Finally, the introduction of Gungans for comic relief is the reason this film is the butt of jokes.

But there are redeemable qualities about this film.  The obvious one is that in the 16 years since ""Jedi"", technology has advanced greatly, so this film is a visual masterpiece.  ""The Phantom Menace"" does an excellent job of establishing the Star Wars universe.  More than any Star Wars film before it, this one feels like there is a wide universe to explore.  And finally, Darth Maul is certainly a highlight in this movie.  While he may not be Vader, he is definitely just as menacing and dangerous.  He spurs some finely-choreographed lightsaber action.

The cast of this movie is great.  Ewan McGregor plays a great Obi-Wan, as he will for the entire trilogy.  His performance is the best of this film.  Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn is also great, and he and McGregor really click together on screen.  Natalie Portman does a decent job as Padme.  And finally, we get a nice Sam Jackson cameo, so that's always nice.

""The Phantom Menace"" is widely considered the worst of the saga (and with good reason), but it is still a decent film.  It makes some mistakes and lacks some of the charm of the original trilogy, but it really hits its stride in the acting and the visuals.  I do not recommend this film as a standalone piece, but it's better when considered part of the overall saga."
"Nov 15, 2013",3,"A bit better than Attack of the Clones, the Phantom Menace edges out Episode 2 slightly, because it's basic story is a bit more followable.  This film mainly suffers from slow pacing, characters speaking in dialogue what the author wants the audience to think and feel, and an unfortunately poorly voiced comic relief character that draws a lot of attention to himself (I watched the Spanish dubbed version and found Jar Jar to be funnier in that version).  However, I very much like the idea behind the film: A child prodigy gets swept up, perhaps unfairly, in the adult world  of combat and political maneuvering, not knowing how to be handled by the disputing adults to which he's entrusted.  I wish they integrated that theme better into the overall plot, but thems the brakes."
"Nov 14, 2013",3,"For as much flack as it gets, and for as cheesy as many moments are, the charm is undeniable, and Darth Maul brings an incredible presence to the film."
"Nov 11, 2013",1.5,"The worst movies are sometimes the prequels...God, this movie is terrible."
"Nov 09, 2013",4,when I was 9years old my mom took me to see this 4x and I still love it today....this was my first introduction to Star wars....I think it's a great film and still looks good to this day.

"Nov 02, 2013",3.5,Darth Maul could have been more menacing but he was just treated as a side kick.
"Oct 30, 2013",2.5,"Okay, so I don't despise this movie anymore. Many parts of it are still bad, but other parts have grown on me."
"Oct 28, 2013",4,No where near as bad as people make it out to be but it will never beat the classics. Now that I'm older I understand the politics side of it but when I was younger I just watched it for fun. It was a fun little exercise with nice visuals and a pod race spectacle. While it seemed like some of the film was filler it all came together for a fun starter and set up.
"Oct 26, 2013",1,If this film was not attached to the name 'Star Wars' we all would have forgotten about it a long time ago.

"Oct 07, 2013",1.5,"Though it may have some visually pleasing moments, ""The Phantom Menace"" takes away everything that made Star Wars astonishing; good story, likable characters, and an engaging universe.

"Oct 01, 2013",5,"First Off, It's Star Wars. That's why it gets a 5/5. Seeing it as a kid, I saw magic on the screen. The vast landscapes of Naboo, the awesome Pod-Race, The Darth Maul lightsaber battle, the music, all of it was classic Star Wars to me. As an adult who has studied filmmaking for two years, this is not a very good movie. I started to see what all the people were complaining about. The over usage of CGI, the boring dialogue and the confusing as hell plot, and just the overall lack of emotion from any of the actors. If this wasn't a Star Wars movie and if I hadn't loved it as a kid, this movie would have fallen completely flat. It's unfortunate, but I am still able to watch it as part of a 6 part saga (soon to be 9) and as I did when I was a kid!"
"Sep 29, 2013",4,I liked it. That's all I'm going to say.
"Sep 29, 2013",3,"I like it in some ways, but I do have many concerns about the whole of the trilogy (please read reviews for later Star Wars films). The main thing I like about this film is the battle between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan against Darth Maul. I really want to avoid repeating this in later reviews, but I'm not happy with the building and vehicles looking so ""anachronistic"" (due to George Lucas relying too much on CGI) - so weird. And I just don't understand why Lucas focused more on politics (like the Trade Federation of Naboo) rather than wars. It's Star Wars, not Star Politics!"
"Sep 29, 2013",2,"On sleepless nights, I sometimes wonder about the poor, lonely soul out there who, once the question is raised, meekly whispers: ""I actually liked Jar Jar Binks."""
"Sep 29, 2013",2,It's pretty obvious George Lucas was more interested in special effects than in the story or character departments.
"Sep 28, 2013",3.5,"although i acknowledge the problems, i don't think it deserves the hate it received"
"Sep 28, 2013",1,"Horrible movie. Jar-Jar Binks is annoying as f*ck, Jake Lloyd sucks as Anakin (although better than Hayden Christensen :3), Darth Maul could have been a great character in the trilogy, he could had the Vader treatment (of course not Obi-Wan's father but a person who killed his master) but is then killed off, and the special effects are cheap. The only three things good about the film is that the idea (aside from Jar Jar being in it and Anakin being a kid (he should have been a Young Adult like Luke was in the original trilogy)) is pretty good, the score is awesome (thanks for Duel of the Fates, John Williams) and the whole movie is completely irrelevant to the rest of the series, its skippable."
"Sep 23, 2013",1,A movie in which things happen and some people die.
"Sep 23, 2013",3,"Worst in the Star Wars series.  At least there's good special effects, which save it from being a total disaster."
"Sep 16, 2013",3.5,I liked this film.  Story was maybe a bit lack luster but the action and development made up for that for me.  The light saber duels were done extremely well in this one and just like the others the music was amazing.
"Sep 15, 2013",4,"I will never understand the hate this movie receives.  Yes, Jar Jar Binks is annoying, but so ia C-3PO.  The story sets up three movies worth of intrigue, and the action is incredible."
"Sep 11, 2013",3.5,"An ""upgraded"" version - effect upgraded that is. It's fitting, and in many ways a big plus for the film. The story is cool, it's often intense and seldom boring. Some scenes are great and you're often put on the edge of your seat. Too bad that there are several things here that I don't like.

Firstly, this is a much more childish film. It tries so hard to be funny, but it's not. Just look at Jar-Jar Binks - a goof. Not funny, just an anoying character. His planet feels unreal, boring and animated, I don't like that. On the plus side, it's a good thing that the story still stays strong. There are cool villains here and there is also a nice flow that carries the film.

7 out of 10 video card updates."
"Sep 09, 2013",1.5,"Incredibly disappointing, banal, and remarkably uninspiring. I am not a Star Wars fan nor do I particularly enjoy science fiction, yet I remain mostly open-minded when I approach these types of films. Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace contributes nearly nothing to the Star Wars story that could not be summed up in a five minute clip of words found in the prologue of a better Star Wars film. The movie's ten minutes of enjoyable action fails to redeem the remaining 2 hours of boring conversations, mediocre special effects, and monotone, uninteresting characters. All around unworthy of your time. Rent it, don't buy it, but put it on when you're trying to sleep and you are seemingly unable to do so. This one will help."
"Sep 08, 2013",3,"A very underrated film, but, in saying that, it is the worst of the saga and a huge disappointment. It will thrill fans and audiences in moments like the pod racing and the finale, but the rest will be a huge bore and cringe-fest."
"Sep 07, 2013",3.5,I love Star Wars but this is not the best in the series. But sets up nicely for other films to follow on. Have to watch so you appreciate the other 5 films.

"Sep 06, 2013",4,"It was a very enjoyable and very underrated science fiction adventure. It had really great special effects, cast, characters, music, adventure, action, cinematography, makeup, costumes and a great storyline. It was a great prequel to the first 3 original Star Wars trilogy. I've seen this movie when I was 6 years old. I recommend this movie to Star Wars fans of all ages."

"Sep 04, 2013",1.5,"The special effects are all there but the film is overwhelmed with emotionless performances, an illogical and deluded plot, bad dialogue, and such a heavy lack of inspiration that the passion and imagination that was involved with the reputation of the originals seems to suffer because of it."
"Sep 04, 2013",2,"Everything the first two movies had that made them such classics is missing from Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, taken and replaced with, albeit impressive visuals effects, but ultimately it's not enought to save the movie."
"Sep 03, 2013",2,"George Lucas takes everything you love about the original Star Wars films and seemingly forgets to put any of it in this one. A reliance on computer effects (over things that matter, like plot and characters) means instead we get unbelievably boring scenes of politicians discussing the taxation of trade routes and two of the most annoying characters in cinema history. Although there are several exciting scenes, especially the duel at the end (one of the best in the series), and a brilliant John Williams score, I am only thankful I wasn't old enough to be crushingly disappointed by this.
Bad."
"Sep 03, 2013",1,"Looking back at the Phantom Menace was it really that bad? Yes, everybody, yes it was. I remember watching the original trilogy on VHS when I was a kid because they were a little before my time. I'd watch them obsessively, over and over, memorizing every line always wondering, ""If these are episodes 4 through 5, where are 1 through 3?"" Then I saw it, the first trailer for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, and it was incredible, myself and all of my friends back then were all talking about how cool the episode I, the precursor to the greatest film trilogy of all time, was going to be. It finally came out in theaters and it seemed like the whole city of Reno, Nevada was there. The prologue roles, ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."" everyone cheers! The letters fade away into the vastness of space, a young Obi Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi and his master, Qui Gon Jin, who was previously unknown to me, enter a trade federation vessel to discuss the prevention of war. This being a Star Wars movie and all, everyone knows that won't work out so it could only mean one thing, the clone wars were coming. The set up is perfect, the fan favorite Obi wan played by a great, up and coming actor and his master played by an already phenomenal actor, there are fantastically choreographed lightsaber fights unlike any we had seen previously and things were looking to turn very exciting very fast. 

But then, just as all of the life long fans begin feeling that same sense of wonder and levity they felt with the originals, the unthinkable happens. No, Obi Wan and Qui Gon aren't blown to bits by a time traveling Death Star in true Star Trek reboot fashion, although that may have been better than what actually happens, but no it is something much worse, this beloved character and his potentially lovable master stumble across an entity so nefarious, so horrendously evil Darth Vader and the Emperor would stare on in pure awe, a creature so terribly disfigured and brain damaged that the Hunchback of Notre Dame would feel like Steven Hawking body snatching Natalie Portman, who is this despicable epitome of scum and villainy? His name is Jar Jar Binks. Yes, the King of Catastrophe, the Connoisseur of Reputation Condemnation, the true Solicitor of Slap Stick Stupidity in the flesh. If you haven't heard of this guy, good for you but you've probably been living under a pop culture rock, this guy has been mocked, mangled, criticized and crucified by almost every Star Wars fan who was unfortunate enough to live long enough to see him come to virtual life from the mind of the Devil himself, 1983 on George Lucas. I'm kidding, of course, but this guy practically single handedly ruined the once great reputation of the Star Wars films. I mean there was some flat acting from the likes of Hayden Christensen and practically all of the child actors in the prequel trilogy, but their bored, emotionless faces look like the great Clark Gable compared to this complete and total silver screen abomination. 

Aside from Star Wars' own ""He who shall not be named,"" the rest of the movie is essentially done in by it's own mediocrity. Young Anakin/Darth Vader is played by Jake Lloyd, who honestly could have fooled me for being a complete and total psychopath, in the sense that he shows essentially no emotion at all, nothing against the kid, just saying he had absolutely no acting talent. Then half of the movie is taken up by a ""pod racing"" scene that was essentially just made so they could put out that horrendous video game based on the concept. Ewan McGregor, who plays Obi Wan through all three prequel films and does a fantastic job in the role later on and is one of the few redeeming parts about the prequels in my eyes, is fine in the film, as is Liam Neeson, though they are in it far too little, without the unbearable presence of ""He who shall not be named,"" that is, to save the movie. The old lovable puppet Yoda is replaced by a creepy animatronic Yoda, who looks to be a distant, less believable cousin of Chucky. Samuel L. Jackson is in it for like 5 minutes and he is one of the few other things I liked about the prequels, but he again, as with Ewan and Liam, is snubbed for screen time by CGI racing nonsense.  I give the Phantom menace a 1 out of 5, solely because of the fantastic talents introduced in this film that carry on into future ones such as Sam Jackson as Mace Windu and Ewan as Obi Wan, and also for the great Liam Neeson, for what little time he is present. As for the draw backs, well they're pretty much everything else. For Angry Star Wars Fans United, this is The Truth You Can't Handle, signing off and may the force be with J.J. Abrams to bring us a damn good show in 2015 to make up for this unrepentant piece of garbage."

"Sep 02, 2013",2,"The fourth Star Wars film, and first of the prequel trilogy, isn't nearly as bad as everyone says - but it's still an awful mess of not-quite-there-yet CGI and wooden dialogue that wouldn't even be suitable for kids' entertainment."
"Aug 29, 2013",2.5,"As a kid I loved this movie, unfortunately I don't think it holds up very well. George Lucas succeeds in his strength (world building, sets, locations, visuals) but the characters are so stale and the story is so convoluted. There are some genuinely cool Star Wars moments here (the podrace, final battle with Maul, design of the Gungan city), but they are few and far between. You have to survive a painfully boring second act, with extended scenes on Tatooine and then Coruscant (bland, boring politics) that are nothing but terrible dialogue delivered by terrible performances. Nostalgia makes this movie just entertaining enough for me, and I wouldn't say I hate it. But if I watched this for the first time as an adult I probably would"
"Aug 28, 2013",5,Great movie to start the series. Gotta love Jar Jar!
"Aug 28, 2013",2,What a disappointment to the series.
"Aug 23, 2013",3.5,"For all the flack that this movie has copped, I can honestly say that it really isn't as bad as most people want it to be.  Sure, there's many things wrong with this prequel - Jar Jar Binks and young Annikan Skywalker only two of them - but the special effects are amazing, the slapdash story is at least an entertaining one, and it is blessed with an excellent John Williams score.  Kids in the 1970's were blown away by the original series, and while most of them were outraged by this convoluted rehash, we can't deny that most children of this current generation were equally blown away by this film.  For years afterwards, I was collecting Star Wars lego, trading cards, videogames, and even managed to read the novelization.  At the end of the day, while TPM barely stands equal to its predecessors, it does do its job at capturing a young audience, and completely bewildering them with some of the most awesome battle sequences filmed up to that point.  Die hard fans would shoot me down, but I think this one is very underrated."
"Aug 23, 2013",1,"Children movie. Nothing to add really. Well, maybe one thing, if you're a grown up, and you want to see this piece of s**t, may the Force be with you..."
"Aug 19, 2013",1.5,Do I need to explain why it's bad?
"Aug 19, 2013",5,"This movie gets so much crap just because of the Gungans, especially Jar Jar Binks. If you can manage to look past that stupidity it's an otherwise great movie."
"Aug 18, 2013",3,Not The Best In The Series But Still Good.B-
"Aug 17, 2013",3,The Movie was alright not the best in the Star Wars Saga. Jar Jar Binks was annoying. There were a couple of good scenes in this movie.
"Aug 16, 2013",4.5,Liam Neeson should never die. Darth Maul is by far my favorite villain in any Star Wars film.
"Aug 15, 2013",2,"3 Words, JAR JAR BINKS"
"Aug 15, 2013",1,Dog shit. Not even Liam Neeson can act his way out of this. This was the downfall of Star Wars. Darth Maul is the only redeeming feature. And I'll say one more thing: JAR JAR BINKS. That is all
"Aug 15, 2013",3,"Coming out 16 years after the finale to the &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; trilogy, &lt;i&gt;The Phantom Menace&lt;/i&gt; is a prequel to the other films in the series. If you were like me and wanted to see even more exploration to the universe that was established in the three previous films, this movie is an attempt to satisfy that, while also allowing you to see the beginnings toward how all of the characters you've grown to know wind up as they are at the beginning of &lt;i&gt;A New Hope&lt;/i&gt;.

It seems like this universe is never happy. There's always some sort of major conflict going on that works as a backdrop. This time around, it's about a corporation trying to illegally force its will on a planet, Naboo. Two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), attempt to resolve the issue via negotiation, but because evil corporations don't want to do that, the two Jedis have to escape and eventually have to save the planet through many action scenes and the recruiting of a 9-year-old boy, Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd). If you saw the other movies, you know why that's important.

Other important characters include Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), who is the leader of Naboo, R2-D2 and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), the droids we've come to know in previous movies, and Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), a CGI creature who serves as some of the least enjoyable comic relief I can think of. Seriously, whoever thought that Jar Jar Binks was a good idea really didn't have a grasp on what most people would find funny.

There's a lot of action in this movie, which isn't a rarity for the series. There are some new things introduced this time around, including an incredibly long race sequence which probably should have been one, not three laps. That would have helped with the pacing. The second act feels really long -- not just because of this -- and any bit of trimming would have been beneficial. It wasn't so much that I was ever bored with &lt;i&gt;The Phantom Menace&lt;/i&gt; as I was severely uninterested in what was happening.

That's another one of the problems it has: There is no emotional connection to be had with any of these characters. They're all so broad and one-dimensional, and they're rarely put into real danger. The tone is light, but there are no scenes where the possibility exists for them to be put in harm's way to balance that out. The film is too silly to take seriously. Even when characters are in trouble, it never feels that way. I never felt for any of these characters because they're too shallow and it never feels like they could be harmed.

They also never seem to do anything on purpose, or of their own volition. Too many of the resolving actions in the film happen by accident, or because someone didn't know what they were doing. ""Oh, that worked!"" they often say with great enthusiasm. A great set-piece involving Anakin flying a ship happens because he's pressing random buttons and some of them wind up working in his favor. Anything Jar Jar Binks does is accidental, even though it's rarely detrimental to the cause.

There's a story reveal that's handled so poorly, and you should see it coming from a mile away, that even attempting it came across as pointless. I'm not sure why it was even included, to be honest. The reveal happens and is so anticlimactic that I can't even begin to describe it. The film as a whole feels that way, too, especially because you won't care about anything that happened before its conclusion. The big battle scene that the entire film seems to be building toward is greatly mishandled and just kind of seems to end without reason.

To &lt;i&gt;The Phantom Menace&lt;/i&gt;'s credit, there are some enjoyable action scenes, and it's never really boring. Getting to see another movie's worth of this universe makes the experience worthwhile regardless of the quality of the rest of the film. There's a really fun lightsaber fight, too, this one involving a skilled warrior named Darth Maul (Ray Park) going up against both of our leading Jedi. You can sort of see what's being built toward here; there is mention that the Sith were supposed to be extinct, but it's clear that they're not, and will be the rivals of the Jedi from this point out.

&lt;i&gt;Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace&lt;/i&gt; has a pretty good cast, even if there aren't a lot of characters worth exploring. The performances from most of the cast members are fine, even if Jake Lloyd, in a pivotal role, is so unbearable to watch. It's not his fault; he's very young here and child actors of this age are almost always terrible, but giving him such an important role was a mistake. Still, seeing Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor wielding lightsabers is quite enjoyable.

I had some fun with &lt;i&gt;Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace&lt;/i&gt;. It wasn't great, and it had a bunch of problems that kept it from living up to any of the earlier films in the franchise, but some of the action scenes are good and seeing more of this universe was definitely worth sitting through. It's not a fantastic movie, and it definitely can't live up to the hype generated from waiting 16 years, but I did enjoy some of it and it was never dull. I suppose I'll take it."
"Aug 14, 2013",0.5,Fuck this piece of shit a walk to Starbucks has a better story and a million times less disappointment I gave this a half star cuz this rating system can't go into negatives
"Aug 14, 2013",0.5,can someone explain to me what the 'phantom' was in this bore-fest?  PS anakin-you're friends with a princess now-cant you buy your mom out of slavery instead of forgetting about her for 12 years then suddenly remembering oh yeah my mom's a slave then snapping when you find she had JUST DIED then go on a youngling killing spree like some dipstick?  ps a planet that's water thru and thru cannot have continents floating on it.  they will sink.
"Aug 12, 2013",4,I think this is a pretty great movie lots of action this is a great prequel but the worst Star Wars movie
"Aug 12, 2013",4.5,(Spoilers Alert) STAR WARS IS BACK!!! And Starts brilliantly... Ewan McGregor Liam Neeson... Yeah... Works... I cant believe he dies!!! Hey ho... Yoda is epic...
"Aug 11, 2013",3,"Uma saga começa-se pelo inicio, mesmo que a ideia seja a criação de uma prequela... Nao foi mau para começar, no entanto, tanto o plot como os diálogos são fracos tendo em conta as exigência, pese embora o cast de bastante valor!"
"Aug 11, 2013",2.5,"Everything that can be said about this movie has been said...so I'll keep it short and brief because the hate for the prequels just sounds like a broken record at this point.. listen...from a purely artificial entertainment level,Darth Maul is awesome, but George Lucas chose to make a Sith who looked cool and had a cool light saber instead of a character... there is so character there. So going from one of the best villains put to film with Darth Vader,to a guy with a cool light saber is really...bad..this is by no means the worst movie ever made,people who genuinely think that are either stupid,or have never seen an actual TERRIBLE movie before, but I think it's just so boring and lacks any heart or charm."
"Aug 07, 2013",1,"It's 1999, the most anticipated prequel EVER has been released and when one leaves the theater, only the most bitter taste is left. What literally happened with the first (not first released) Star Wars is that the movie collapsed under its own weight. There was just NO way that it could ever possibly meet expectations. Let's just say Lucas started benching at 100lbs and by the time the film was to be completed, he had to bench 250lbs--yup, nothing he could do would ever get him close to that kind of weight. Where ""the Phantom Menace"" slides off the road is in its coordination. It's quite easy to tell that Lucas had all of these ideas that he's always desired to pursue and simply taped all the pieces hoping that the picture would look excellent. The result is a distorted image, ruined by the intense 'decorations' that were applied to make this movie as epic as the filmmakers possibly could. Nothing backfired on the creator of Star Wars more than the decision to entirely focus the movie on Anakin. I understand that the Star Wars films are really about our dearest Annie, the once-innocent child who'd grow up to become the most feared and evil individual robot-man in the universe. ""The Phantom Menace"" was meant to show the embarking on a journey that would find Anakin the greatest success but simultaneously commence the countdown to his gradual fall to the dark side. We (the audience) get a glimpse of the toll Anakin experienced of leaving his mother, that's literally all the trauma there is to show. However, as everyone (minus Lucas) can see, that's not enough material for a film of this proportion. Star Wars is about Anakin's downfall and redemption, the series was supposed to revolve around Anakin, not narrowly attach all the attention to him. That doesn't mean that Lucas should have tossed away Anakin's view of things, it just meant that his story should be the leading component but not the sole component. Lucas should have built Vader's origins WITH the plot NOT on top of it. There was so much to explore with the prequel trilogy like: what errors were the Jedi Council making that caused the Jedi to go extinct? What factors stirred the Clone Wars? The Sith, who are they really and what do they seek? What was so difficult about being a Jedi that Anakin became susceptible to the dark side? These are all things that were better explored by the 2008-2013 TV series, the Clone Wars-I'll just add that when a cartoon NAILS the concepts behind the series better than the movies do-there's an undoubtedly HUGE problem. Yes, I'm looking at you too, Avatar: the Last Airbender. The problem isn't the acting, it isn't the excessive uses of CGI, it isn't the fact that Anakin is annoy as hell who should have never have been able to even become the Dark Lord of the Girl Scouts. It's really because Lucas killed off Darth Maul (okay, not really, I'm a huge fan, that's why I bring Maul up). No, the real problem is the mountain of garbage that Lucas tried to pass off as a masterpiece. There's a lot in ""the Phantom Menace"" that does absolutely NOTHING to progress the film forward in anyway, it just doesn't lead the original trilogy in any way. If the other episodes never exited, I would have assumed the movie starts and ends here-never, would I have imagined that there were 5 more films (with more to come :D). Two highlights came about in 1999: Darth Maul and John Williams' score. Aside from that, EVERYTHING about this film is ravaged and obliterated by the sole, creative mind of the amazing creator of Star Wars, George Lucas. Fortunately, 'New Hope' and 'Empire' were amazing in their own time and remain the best films that the series had to offer."
"Aug 07, 2013",4,Despite what others might think the phantom menace was a good movie. It brought back star wars in a new way. There were only two things bad with the phantom menace. The first was the fake queens emotion were equal to Kristian Stewart. The other one is Darth mauls death he is the Darth Vader of the prequel trilogy. People are confused about the midi-clorians. They believe that they are the force but that is ever said in the movie said qui gon jim says that but the speaker will of the force very different. Its like how the Prophet of old speak the will of God. The Prophet are not God. Also the indications for midi-Clorian in for the proof that forces is biological and spiritual. The character jar jar I was not that annoyed by and I just ignored him.  The acting of the crew and cast were good and battles were greatly pasted and they kept the emperors identity a secret. Overall the movie had a good balance of slow and fast just like the original I encouraged any one to rewatch it and give it a second chance. Because like it or not It already happened in a galaxy far far away.
"Aug 06, 2013",3,"This is the one that is considered the weakest of the six mainstream films. Even as a kid, I didn't enjoy it much. Looking at it today, it's an okay Sci Fi film. It may have even been a good sci-fi film, but it was a BAD Star Wars film. I give it three stars out of five because of how much I LOVE Darth Maul."
"Aug 06, 2013",3,"Si Darth Maul hubiese sobrevivido,y si éste hubiese matado a Jar Jar Binks de una forma sangrienta y despiadada, la película hubiese sido mucho mejor."
"Aug 03, 2013",5,Do not defy the power of the force
"Aug 03, 2013",3.5,"Though by far the best in the STAR WARS saga, The Phantom Menace shows that there is much in store for Star Wars."
"Aug 01, 2013",3,"Oh god the Prequels what can be said about these films that hasn't been said already?
Basically all I can say is This. 

 What I Liked - The CGI Effects for the late 90s Look Pretty good and they still look impressive, The acting is all right The actors do the best they can with the script that is given too them and at least try and make something out of it, John William's musical Score is outstanding I still remember the tunes to this day and with good reason.

"Jul 31, 2013",2,"this film is boring, it grossly and unnecessarily overdoses in cgi effects. The characters are shallow and the dialogue is dry.

"Jul 23, 2013",5,This prequel may not be the best Star Wars movie but it is very entertaining. The story is very modern dealing with and politics and that's what's great about it. The characters (Yes even Jar Jar) are very likeable. The special effects aren't as good as Episode III but they're great. The battles are intense and you have a good popcorn movie.

"Jul 09, 2013",4.5,This was good but still not as good as you know what
"Jul 09, 2013",3.5,"Star Wars is a phenomenon. It was since the original film was released in 1977 and will continue on long after we are gone, one of the few franchises that will irrevocably become known by the majority of the civilized world. But then in 1999 came the long awaited commencer to the new prequel trilogy, ""The Phantom Menace"". The anticipation was unparalleled and bordered on the obsessive, expectations rose as high as the mountaintops and George Lucas still enjoyed his position as a respected filmmaker. Then the movie was released. Fans felt upset, then cheated, then enraged, labeling the movie a betrayal of everything that they once loved about this franchise. We have all heard the story. My general response is less than sympathetic. 

Normally, I make it a point not to refer to other peoples' experiences watching a movie. When I write a review it is just the movie and my experience watching the movie that matter. But this is a case that is too extreme to not address. In all of my years watching, admiring and learning about movies I have not come across one that has suffered as much exorbitant hatred as ""The Phantom Menace"". While I will agree that it does not compare to the original 3 films, in and of itself it is nowhere near as terrible as so many make it out to be. I will openly admit that I enjoy all 3 of the prequels and, in some ways, have become more attached to them than the originals. Not because I think they are better, but because I have often found myself having to stand up for them. Thus, some of this article will be devoted more to defending the film than formally evaluating it. In so doing, I will address one specific criticism that is commonly thrown: failure as a Star Wars film.

As befits an entry in this series, there is a rather simple story to tell, though there are quite a few details that younger viewers will simply tune out (I can attest to this because I was 8 at the time). Granted, it lacks the power of the original ""Star Wars"" but still manages to accomplish what it has to. It tells a self-contained tale while at the same time laying the foundation for the future installments. It provides rudimentary information regarding why Skywalker eventually became Darth Vader, reveals the beginning of the Emperor's rise to power and establishes the state of things before everything took a down spiral. A narrative does not need to be intricate or complex to be effective; it just has to engage the audience. The Land Before Time is a good example of this. This all leads to a thrilling climax that includes the obligatory lightsaber duel, the likes of which had not yet been seen. Noteworthy is that none of this is meant to be taken too seriously. Given that these movies have their roots in old film serials and B-movies it is expected that some of it will fly in the face of logic, despite the fact that things are far more elaborate than usual. Too many people have disregarded that and conjured up excuses to tear this movie down. 

Lucas has a reputation for not being a strong director of actors and that problem is on display here for all to see. While there is no shortage of star power, many of the leads do not deliver their lines with the zing that has come to be expected in this series. Ironically, some of the few exceptions to this are Jar Jar Binks, Watto and Boss Nass. Qui-Gon Jinn is possibly the only one that the audience can become attached to given the nobility that Liam Neeson brings to the role, though there was a lost opportunity to create a stronger dynamic between him and the young Obi-Wan. As it stands, we only get the very basic mentor/student relationship. However, regardless of the criticisms used to level the film from this angle, stiff performances do not equate with horrible ones. If you want to see an example of horrible acting, then watch Swept Away or Cutting Class. I don't even believe the performances to be that bad to begin with. The real problem is that not a great amount of effort was devoted to making the characters compelling, but given the sheer number of things that had to be set up this is forgivable.

I have heard repeatedly that ""The Phantom Menace"" does not deserve to be called a Star Wars film because of its failure to capture what made A New Hope so timeless. I partially agree with that, although it is somewhat unfair to dwell upon and makes me wonder why no one makes a similar criticism of the new Star Trek films. When ""A New Hope"" came out, it was fresh and innovative, the type of blockbuster that no one had yet seen. It was unreasonable to expect ""The Phantom Menace"" to initiate another shift in American cinema. Some will immediately point to the stilted acting and average dialogue, viewed as pitiful compared to the wittier and more exciting script of the latter, but this is ultimately a hollow point that does not have much bearing on the matter (despite the grossly exaggerated allegations made about the script's quality). Others will point to the incorporation of political matters, but given that these mostly take a back seat to everything else it is unreasonable to magnify them so. This is not a movie about taxation or trade disputes; it is about a group of heroes freeing a planet from an invasion. Beyond that, it is imperative to understand that the Star Wars films are space operas, not grand philosophical statements or commentaries on history. I echo the great Roger Ebert in saying, ""the importance of the movies comes from their energy, their sense of fun, their colorful inventions and their state-of-the-art special effects"". This is a space opera through and through.

Let us consider a sequel that is not faithful to the spirit of its predecessor. The Lost World is often regarded as an unworthy successor to Jurassic Park. While I consider it a passable movie for what it is, I agree that it mostly fails in the aforementioned regard. This is because The Lost World is a straight up monster movie with a story that only serves to string together many action sequences, which was not the case with Jurassic Park. The latter was, more specifically, a disaster movie that incorporated scientific elements, somewhat explored the dangers of reckless scientific discovery and aimed for suspense and terror. The Lost World has virtually none of that and settles for a typical monster on the loose premise. In other words, it has the problem of sliding into another sub-genre. Need I make any comment on ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" or ""The Secret of NIMH 2""? In contrast, ""The Phantom Menace"" boasts the elements that make a space opera successful, and thus much of what made ""A New Hope"" successful. There are still many imaginative settings and special effects, exciting action sequences and even a few additional homages to classic mythology. A strong script does not make a space opera, but can elevate it well above the norm, and that is the big difference. 

Getting past all of this, two aspects of the film that are indisputably well done are the effects and music, both of which have always been crucial to the Star Wars franchise. Lucas has always made a point about pushing the envelope when it comes to special effects and has reportedly stated that the vision he had for the prequel trilogy could not have been realized without digital effects. As a result, he has garnered a reputation for being more concerned with this than anything, but given that it provides much of the magic of Star Wars this is to be expected. True, the special effects tend to overshadow the actors, but the same was true of the 1977 film when it was released. There was much more to appreciate there that people eventually came to realize, but that does not change that audiences were so transfixed by the effects that all of that stuff had little bearing on the initial impressions. Why this one type of component was enough to enchant years ago but is now deemed secondary to what happens to be the film's weaker aspects leaves me nonplussed. Just about every scene in the film contains some type of digital effect, which many have called excessive. Indeed, some of them could have been done by practical methods, such as the aliens on Tatooine and the space battle, but many would have otherwise been far too expensive and time consuming. Good luck creating the entire droid army and the underwater city in the same film without the more modern techniques. There is a very real sense of discovery in The Phantom Menace, and even after 14 years I still find joy in simply exploring the new worlds created for this film. John Williams does his usual excellent job on the soundtrack, bolstering the impact of scenes as much as always, particularly during the climax and funeral pyre, the latter of which brings a sense of sadness. 

Now, allow me to be clear on one last thing. I don't begrudge anyone for their dislike of this movie. If someone feels it amounts to an unsatisfying viewing experience, that is perfectly fine. But, as James Berardinellli put it, ""there is a difference between disliking a film and spewing bile about it"". As with an evaluation of anything else, there is a certain degree of professionalism and civility that is expected, which I have never seen in the bloated and hollowly pedantic efforts at making this film out to be one of the worst ever made."
"Jul 08, 2013",0.5,"Probably the most boring and disappointing movie ever made. Nothing makes any sense in the movie, the characters are all boring, the script is godawful and young Anakin is horrible! The lightsaber fight at the end is pretty cool though.

"Jul 06, 2013",5,a good one for a start of a new trilogy
"Jul 06, 2013",2.5,It has its good parts.
"Jul 06, 2013",2,"Grade - C
What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before? - Nothing. So I shall just reiterate that this was one hell of a disappointment."
"Jul 06, 2013",3,"If anything, time has boded well for Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. To wait decades for this movie, to worship the trilogy that came before it, and to ultimately get this...I can only imagine how brutal it must have been. Luckily for me, I did not (and do not) worship the original trilogy, and I saw this movie years and years after it was released. By the time I saw this, it already had reached a cult status of awfulness. But no matter how I spin it, I still enjoyed this movie. I understand and appreciate every criticism of this movie. But I still had fun with it.

The story is an overly complicated and intricate one, but it generally focuses on young Anakin Skywalker. He is discovered on the planet Tatoonine by the Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon realizes that the force is immensely strong with young Anakin, and decides to train him in the way of the Jedi. But the Dark Side of the Force wants to dispose of Skywalker before he becomes a threat. So Darth Sidious sends his trainee, Darth Maul to dispose of Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Anakin.

In all fairness to George Lucas, he does get some things right. The main story of Anakin isn't a bad one. And the scenes revolving around the young Skywalker aren't bad. The movie as a whole has a much more common narrative path compared to the original trilogy, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The movie does get bogged down in juvenile humor, complicated political subplots, and excessive CGI. 

Let me address the first negative. The juvenile humor in this movie is atrocious. It must have been quite jarring to see such childish humor when this movie was originally released. And the source of most of this juvenile humor is the character Jar Jar Binks. He is quite literally the worst thing to ever happen to Star Wars. I almost feel bad for the character. This mistake rests solely on George Lucas.

The second negative isn't as glaring as the first. The movie deals quite a bit with the political side of the Star Wars universe. Which I don't mind, to some extent, but this movie just took it a bit too far. All the talk of trade routes and treaties just gets a bit dull after a while.

And lastly, the movie hasn't aged particularly well. The CGI creatures and the puppets all look...well, like CGI creatures and puppets. It's all looks very 1990s, which isn't a good thing. An especially bad usage of puppets are the Viceroys. They just look awful.

But the movie isn't all bad. Liam Neeson gives a noble performance as Qui-Gon Jinn. The character is stuck with some bad dialogue and corny situations, but Neeson still pulls it off. With little back story or character development, Neeson is able to invest us in Qui-Gon. I instantly took a liking to the character. He is one of the better things about the movie.

Ewan McGregor costars as Obi-Wan Kenobi. He isn't given enough interesting things to do on screen, but McGregor does give a decent performance. At this point in the trilogy, McGregor's performance isn't up to par with Alec Guinness's, but he isn't bad. The best of Obi-Wan is yet to come!

Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd play the two younger characters. Portman plays Queen Padmé well enough. She doesn't stand out as being good or bad. He character gets her best emotional moments in Episode III. Comparing Portman to Jake Lloyd, it's easy to see why one became a star and one didn't. Lloyd has some really bad moments as Anakin Skywalker. Still, he isn't completely bad. For the most part, he plays Anakin as good as any 10 year old could. But near the end of the movie, his acting breaks down. When Anakin is flying around during the climax, Lloyd delivers his lines all wrong. They're said so leisurely for such a life and death situation, it's noticeably horrible. On a whole though, Lloyd isn't atrocious, and he shouldn't be blamed for this movie's failures.

A big plus of this movie is the climatic duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul. On a quick side-note, it's ironic how Darth Maul was probably one of the most heavily marketed characters of the early 2000s, but he only gets about 25 minutes of screen time. Still, Darth Maul works very well as a hard-core villain. The duel with his character easily wipes the floor with anything from the previous trilogy. In my opinion, it's the second best lightsaber duel in the entire Saga. The visuals in this scene and the podracing tournament go a long way in erasing some of the bad taste left by the more negative parts of the movie.

And on a quick note, John Williams once again knocks the score out of the park! He introduces two awesome new themes. One, the much celebrated Duel of Fates theme. It's an epic, choral piece that highlights the finale duel. A true masterpiece. Then there is Anakin's theme. It too is fantastic. It is sweet and innocent, but it develops into the  Imperial March at the end. The score might very well be my favorite in the entire Star Wars series.

All in all, The Phantom Menace is a mess. There's no denying that. But the movie is so colorful, the action is such over-the-top fun, and the story is interesting enough to warrant a positive review. When I think of this movie, I do have fond thoughts. Thankfully, because I was never the biggest fan of the original trilogy, I am able to enjoy Episode 1. I like this movie for a lot of the wrong reasons, but I was consistently entertained by it. It's fun.

"Jul 02, 2013",2,"SPOILERS: As I've said in my reviews to the original trilogy, Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi are three of the greatest movies of all time. This is the first film written and directed only by George Lucas and it is terrible. This movie manages to have boring and ridiculous dialogue, boring characters, boring plots, and it manages to completely screw up the story of both trilogies. Jar-Jar Binks is the one of the problems with this movie. He's not the only one but, he does manage to annoy every real Star Wars fan constantly. Lucas tried to make him another Chewbacca but, failed miserably. The reason Chewbacca was good was because he DIDN'T TALK! Every time Jar Jar opens his mouth it's the most annoying thing you could ever imagine. He's like a high pitched, stupid Yoda. He's not the only character that says stupid thing though, the dialogue is so bad that even the actors at times acted like they weren't sure of what they said. Then we have another problem. Who was the main character of this movie? Is it Qui-gon-Jinn, the guy who dies at the end and convinces the council to train a soon-to-be villain? Is it Obi-Wan, the guy who just complains about everything and says horribly written, unfunny jokes? Is it Anakin, the guy who the original trilogy is supposed to be about? No, because you don't meet him until half way through the movie where you really wish you hadn't. The child who plays young Darth Vader cannot act to save his life. He can't speak the dialogue properly, he looks bored at times, and over all Anakin was a boring character. I could go on in full detail about how boring the characters are, how the bad guys don't have a motive, and how the new films are marketed to children and yet have boring political talk, slavery, kidnap, torture and hinted rape. If you haven't seen this film, please, do not watch it. It does get points however for being fun if you're over the age of fourteen and willing to listen to the dialogue. Darth Maul was a cool villain and the final fight was pretty great."
"Jul 01, 2013",0.5,Nothing good happens and I think its the worst film ever
"Jul 01, 2013",2,"It's a fun time at best. The dialogue is ok, the acting is fine, the action is exciting and fun."
"Jul 01, 2013",2.5,"I want to like this film. I mean, it's STAR WARS, something I've loved for literally as long as I can remember. But this movie....this is not my kind of Star Wars I grew up with, but then again I'm getting older. I was almost 20 when The Phantom Menace was released in May of 1999, and I suspect if I was 10 or more years younger at the time I would've been able to appreciate it more. As it is, though, this is by far the worst Star Wars movie ever and maybe the biggest disappointment I ever felt while leaving a movie theater. While Episode I is just as flashy (if not more so) than the first Star Wars movie from twenty-two years earlier, the substance underneath can be difficult to find. Too many CG creatures filling up the screen, not enough human interaction and development. George Lucas somehow forgot at some point that often the main reason we love Star Wars and movies in general, is that we care about the characters and bond with them in a short time. This rarely if ever happens to me, no matter how many times I've seen the film. There are some good parts; The podrace is, for the most part, very fun and pure cinematic Star Wars in feel and it was nice to come back to Tatooine, the desert planet from the first Star Wars film and Return of the Jedi. However, overall, The Phantom Menace works better as eye candy than an engrossing story. A shame."
"Jun 26, 2013",3.5,A slow but entertaining prequel that becomes weighted down by politics and a few irritating characters.
"Jun 26, 2013",1,"I really don't see the point in explaining why The Phantom Menace is a soul crushingly awful movie, so let me just state the obvious: the 3D re-release is basically George Lucas' way of taking a sh*t on your childhood for the second time. This sucks. Stay away."
"Jun 24, 2013",4,"worst in the series, but much better than people give it credit.  after all there are only 6 movies ever with jedi and lightsaber duels."
"Jun 23, 2013",3.5,"I was originally iffy on this franchise and to b I still am a little. I saw the very first one and was pretty surprised by it, the action was good and the movie kept u entertained. I look forward to seeing the other 5 of them. This one had a pretty good story line and I would definitely watch it again"
"Jun 23, 2013",2,Only worth two stars. Silly plot and poor acting.
"Jun 22, 2013",4,Another grossly underrated movie.  Set the stage for everything to come later.
"Jun 21, 2013",3,"The Phantom Menace was a little disappointing. It didn't have the Star Wars feel to it. It was just like the beginning of a completely new, but mediocre sci-fi trilogy."
"Jun 18, 2013",3.5,Jar Jar Binks you almost took down a legacy! May you be ashamed yourself!
"Jun 17, 2013",5,Best star wars film of the prequel trilogy. amazing
"Jun 17, 2013",1,"After such a long wait and much anticipation this film was a lead balloon of a dud filled with boring and convoluted neo-political nonsense, the much-maligned Jar Jar Binks (the single worse character in the Star Wars universe), and midichlorians? WTF!/!"

"Jun 13, 2013",2,"Too much over reliance on special effects, annoying characters, and a dull script ruin this prequel to one of the best trilogies of all time."
"Jun 12, 2013",3.5,not bad. especially not as bad as everyone said
"Jun 12, 2013",4.5,"The most misunderstood of the series, great plot and character development. Fantastic lightsaber duels, and special effects. That's all one could ask for, still it manages to capture the spirit of the original series. No matter what people may say it IS a great movie!"
"Jun 11, 2013",3,"The special effects are as terrific as ever, but its story and characters lack the charm and sophistication of the original films."
"Jun 10, 2013",3,"take away the bad special effects, confusing scenes, and bad acting, you have an enjoyable movie"
"Jun 10, 2013",3.5,A great start to the new trilogy.
"Jun 09, 2013",3,"Good enough as a Star Wars film, but the stilted performances, the politically charged script riddled with wooden dialogue, and a huge lack of Darth Maul make it the weakest of the saga.  Still it's a journey worth going thru for its visual splendor, wholesome fun, and adventure.

The whole saga works against all odds really because Lucas created such an expansive universe with a deep mythology that is by now legendary.  It's infectious."
"Jun 09, 2013",3,"Eeeehhh, it's OK in a technical way. We still have the war scenes and some awesome lightsaber duels...it's OK, it's entertaining and all, but is nearly a terrible prequel to an awesome saga. Still, this isn't that much bad to kill the franchise, we will still have some good returns later...right?"
"Jun 09, 2013",0.5,So bad it is worth half a star.
"Jun 08, 2013",2.5,"Childish, grueling, and lacking much substance in both story and entertainment. The worst film in the Star Wars franchise by far."
"Jun 06, 2013",4.5,I really liked this one. Best of the new series.
"Jun 05, 2013",4,"Oh come ON. This movie wasn't bad at ALL. Let me guess why this got bad reviews. Oh right. JAR JAR. He barely has any part! Get over it! This movie was a fun family adventure that is on record my second favorite of the star wars franchise. Sure this movie wasn't the best but it's still good. Star Wars fans will love this. Just remember, IGNORE JAR JAR. HE DOESNT HAVE ANY PART BESIDES 3 MINUTES OF SCREEN TIME. Thank you. enjoy the movie."
"Jun 04, 2013",2.5,"The only good part of this movie is Darth Maul, but other than that, ESPECIALLY with that  Microsoft Paperclip of the Star Wars galaxy, Jar-Jar-Binks, the OBNOXIOUS retard, this movie is headed for the dumpster."
"Jun 04, 2013",3.5,"say what you will, I still love this movie. Neeson is superb."
"Jun 03, 2013",2.5,"Not even close to great, but I personally think it's not the disaster that critics (and even fans) make it out to be. It contains a couple of the best scenes in the saga (the podrace, three way lightsaber duel), and come on, Darth Maul! Who cares about the (GASP) trade embargo? And we can ignore the stupid midi-chlorians (that was a real gimmick, Lucas). And Jar-Jar was for the kids, get over yourself. Poor character development is the real beast here."
"Jun 02, 2013",2.5,The most disappointing thing since my son.
"Jun 02, 2013",2.5,"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is a 1999 epic space opera science fiction fantasy action film written, produced, and directed by George Lucas and starring Jake Lloyd, Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Pernilla August, Ahmed Best, Samuel L. Jackson, Frank Oz, Ray Park, Ian McDiarmid, Terence Stamp, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Sofia Coppola, Brian Blessed, and Keira Knightley. The film is the first installment in the Star Wars prequel trilogy.

Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is a young apprentice Jedi Knight under the tutelage of Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who will later father Luke Skywalker and become the villain known as Darth Vader, is just a nine-year-old boy. When the Trade Federation cuts off all routes to the planet Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter, but when they arrive, they are brought to Queen Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) by Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best).

Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan plan to escort Amidala to a meeting of Republic leaders in Coruscant, but trouble with their spacecraft strands them on Anakin's home planet Tatooine, where Qui-Gon meets Anakin, the slave of a scrap dealer. Qui-Gon is soon convinced that the boy could be the leader the Jedis have been searching for, and he begins bargaining for his freedom and teaching the boy the lessons of the Force.

I was a massive Star Wars fan growing up, having been a huge fan of the original trilogy. Strong characters, excellent action scenes, great stories, good performances, wonderful special effects, and even legitimately decent dialogue are what Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi all had in common with one another. I was hyped as hell for The Phantom Menace. When I finally got to see it in theaters, I did enjoy it...but not as much as I thought I would. Years later, I don't really like this movie.

Now, while I don't like this movie, I don't think it's an unholy abomination. Before you all throw your laptops and lightsaber toys at the wall, let me explain. Yes, it's not a good movie by any means. That is a fact. Yes, the acting isn't good. Yes, the plot should've been more simplified and coherent. Yes, the dialogue is terrible. Yes, Jar Jar Binks is an annoying-as-hell CGI turd. However, The Phantom Menace really isn't as terrible as it's made out to be.

Now, let me get all the bad shit out of the way first before I get to the good stuff. First of all, with the exceptions of Liam Neeson, Ian McDiarmid, and Ewan McGregor, the acting is sub-par. Natalie Portman already gave a great performance in The Professional and this film was five years after that movie, so why she gave a sub-par performance is beyond me. Samuel L. Jackson is shockingly bland and uninteresting, and he looks bored throughout the entire prequel trilogy. And of course, Jake Lloyd sucks. Enough said.

Next up, Jar Jar Binks is the most obnoxious, irritating, naïve, childish, racially insensitive CGI creation ever to grace the silver screen (until Transformers 2 introduced to us to the plebs known as Skids and Mudflap). Good Lord. Granted, the CGI effects for him are impressive, but that doesn't excuse the fact that he's so damn annoying. Lucas should've just written him out and replaced him with a more fleshed-out, less irritating character.

Then, we have the story, which involves the fate of the planet Naboo and a trade dispute. Really? A fucking trade dispute in a Star Wars movie? Who in God's name cared about this? We don't even care about what happens to the people of Naboo because Lucas rarely shows us what's happening in Naboo. And finally, we have the Midichlorians. Good holy God, need I say more?

Now, we get the good shit. The special effects were fantastic for their time. Although by today's standards, you could claim that they look like a PlayStation 3 video game, they're still pretty damn impressive nevertheless. This was the first movie to use computer-generated imagery to create different worlds and it looks superb. In terms of visuals, the Star Wars prequels rarely lack creativity.

The cinematography by David Tattersall is gorgeous. Say what you will about the Star Wars prequels, but they're undoubtedly beautiful-looking films. The set designs by Gavin Bocquet look really cool. The action sequences are very fun to watch, especially the pod race and the final fight between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon &amp; Obi-Wan. The music score by John Williams is just as amazing as ever. Williams' music is another pro of the Star Wars prequels.

FINAL SCORE: 5/10

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is a mixed bag. It's spectacular on a technical level, yet terrible in terms of storytelling and dialogue. Some people have forgiven this movie for being lackluster as they say it's only the first in the prequel trilogy and it's just setting up everything to follow. However, this film needed to be its own movie first and foremost as the original three films were. It needed to have good characters and a somewhat interesting story, and sadly, it didn't. It's a fun watch, but holy shit, did it need to have a lot of mistakes fixed."
"Jun 02, 2013",3,Most people dislike the 1st one but its my favourite out of the starwars franchise but then i guess that says something about starwars...
"Jun 01, 2013",0.5,"To his defense, lucas had many years to buy into his own hype &amp; pay for the facsde of thinking anything he creates will automatically make sense. This film is more Terrible than Jar Jar Binks."
"Jun 01, 2013",4.5,"As someone who critics a movie- it had an absolutely shallow plot, undeveloped characters, and no real point or value explained at the end bringing the prequel triology off to a slow start. However, as a sci-fi fan and because of how much I loved this movie when I was young, I decided it deserved a break."
"Jun 01, 2013",1,Its called episode 1 and that is the rating it deserves.
"Jun 01, 2013",2,"This is just really not good.  Where the original trilogy had a very good mixture of practical and digital effects, the new films fully rely on CGI in order to set the story. The film never really becomes a world that the audience feels comfortable in because it looks so glossy and perfect.  Also, there always has to be something happening in the background.  This seems to be Lucas's issue with the digital ""enhancement"" of the older films and the entire new trilogy.  There are weird situations and pratfalls constantly happening at the background that become distracting from the scene happening in the foreground.  It's just...why?  Why are you even taking the time to do these things?"
"May 31, 2013",3.5,This was good - but .... you know - never quite like the original 2
"May 30, 2013",3,It has its moments but at lest it helps out with 4 through 6 I gotta say
"May 29, 2013",3.5,"Better than Attack Of The Clones, brings a certain nostalgia back, retains that light hearted star wars magic, where politics, the senate, and pesky ambassadors weren't part of Lucass script...awesome job by Liam Neeson as Qui Gon Jinn, and Darth Maul rocks"
"May 28, 2013",2,I only give it two stars because of Darth Maul.  Other than that you have young Anakin and Jar Jar... Fucking Jar Jar
"May 27, 2013",3.5,it was good but the script is almost laughable sometimes
"May 26, 2013",3.5,"good series, must see all of the movies."
"May 24, 2013",4,"I know most die-hard Star Wars fans hate this movie, but I really enjoyed it. If you can accept the fictional characters from the fictional worlds which Lucas created, this tells an entertaining story."
"May 24, 2013",2,"Although it is visually engaging, the fifth chapter (or the second), doesn't even hold a candle to the old ones. The dialogue is dreadful and the movie is simply not awe-inspiring and lacks the feeling of adventure that was the basis for this saga. Liam Neeson, in a simple role, is as great as he's ever been and he is well accompanied by the inexperienced ""star in the making/future Oscar winner"" Natalie Portman."
"May 20, 2013",3,its the least of the star wars films but still an okay entry
"May 20, 2013",3.5,"""Fear is the path to the Dark Side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate... leads to suffering.""

Lets go back in time to the year 1999. It's been 16 years since Return of the Jedi was released, and everybody is super excited for the return of Star Wars on the big screen, especially considering that fans will finally get to witness the introduction of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Darth Vader, and other characters that would lead them to what they end up becoming in the acclaimed ""sequels."" Plus George Lucas returns to direct the film, something he hasn't done since A New Hope, and John Williams gets to return to provide the epic score. Once the film opens, everyone is anxiously anticipating Episode 1; the theme blasts and everyone starts cheering... but then by the end of the experience, mostly everyone feels disappointed by the final result. 

To this day, The Phantom Menace has been considered the worst film in the Star Wars franchise. I was not one who first experienced this film in theaters, as I was a little too young to go to a movie theater in 1999, but I can imagine the reactions of a lot of disappointed fans who were expecting something as awesome as the original trilogy. But in the opinion of The Movie King, and the fact that I myself am a massive Star Wars fan, I was more forgiving of The Phantom Menace. Sure it was flawed in places and I had a ton of issues with Lucas' character creations (which I'll get to later in this review), but at the end of the day, it's still Star Wars and I still enjoyed it for what it was.

Set some 30 years before A New Hope, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are sent to settle a blockade made by the corrupt Trade Federation, unaware that the blockade is the first steps of an invasion led by Sith Lord Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) and are forcing the Queen of Naboo (Natalie Portman) to sign their treaty. With the help of Gungan Jar-Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), the Jedi rescue the Queen and escape the blockade, but then get stranded in the planet of Tattoine. There, Qui-Gon  meets Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a slave boy who dreams to be a Jedi. Eventually, Qui-Gon frees the boy and intends to train him as a Jedi, but before he can do that, he, Obi-Wan, the Queen, and an army of Gungans have to lead an attack to defeat the Trade Federation and the Sith.

The Phantom Menace also features Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker, Brian Blessed as Gungan ruler Boss Nass, Frank Oz as Yoda, Samuel L. Jackson as Jedi master Windu, Ray Park as Sith apprentice Darth Maul, Terence Stanp as Supreme Chancellor Valorum, Kenny Baker as R2-D2, and Anthony Daniels as C-3PO.

Why am I more forgiving of this film than other massive Star Wars fans? Well, first off, this film has good visuals. And when I say good visuals, I mean REALLY GOOD visuals. This was the first Star Wars film to make extensive use of CGI, and Lucas does a grand job at crating his visual world, from the peaceful world of Naboo, the dusty world of Tattooine, and even the busy and wondrous world of Corosaunt, home of the Jedi Knights and the Republic. CGI designs for creatures are good as well, especially the Gungans, Watto, Sebulba, and the villain droids. The final act, featuring a grand space battle, shows Lucas's incredible scope of state-of-the-art visual filmmaking and how visual making should be done.

Prequels tend to have a bad rep in the film business due to expectations of being as strong as its ""sequels"", and this prequel trilogy had had some really bad reviews over the years over its story. For Phantom, the story is definitely weak in places, especially when it lacks some characterization (the Trade Federation isn't really that menacing) and even some darker motivations (it fails to explain why the Sith demands revenge on the Jedi), but I liked where Lucas was going in the end. The political moments, considering that the Federation lacks pure menace, are actually good sequences, as I respect Lucas's desire of the arguments between democracy and a more controlled government, ideas that have been debated in politics for years. These ideas work remarkably well for Star Wars, as they would eventually lead out into the evil Galactic Empire when Episode 4 comes in.

Here's where my criticisms come in for this one. First off, the acting isn't that great. There were some good performances, such as Liam Neeson's strong role as Qui-Gon, Pernilla August's heartwarming performance as Anakin's mother, and Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sideous, a role that does well in showing his progression as The Emperor, but the rest range from decent to just plain awful. Ewan McGregor, while I liked that he tried hard, was a weak Obi-Wan, though he gets his chance to shine as the prequels progress. Natalie Portman, in one of her earlier roles, is awful as Queen Amidala, too over-confident and too bland. Frank Oz is great again as Yoda, but needed a lot more screen time, along with R2 and 3PO. Samuel L. Jackson feels really out of place as Windu and has little involvement in the film. While Darth Maul is an awesome villain, and he gets an awesome lightsaber battle with Neeson and McGregor, as Ray Park is an excellent martial artist, his character progression is extremely weak and I wanted to know more about his past. But the worst acting is without a doubt Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, that infamous Gungan that's had the majority if the hatred on this film over the years. Jar Jar is definitely the worst character in the whole film and one of the worst characters in all of film. He's annoying, he's obnoxious, and he's extremely stupid. You can easily tell that Lucas only created this character only to make little kids laugh hysterically. Even Lucas admitted that that was his intention, plus his animators admit that they've created a terrible character. And that leads me to my next criticism, that there's too much childish humor in this, mostly coming from Jar Jar. I cringe watching Jar Jar stepping in poop and hearing the sound of a camel farting with the audience expecting that Binks did it. It's way too childish and juvenile for a Star Wars movie.

And what about Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker? Well, considering the hate on his acting, I actually thought he was decent in the role. Lloyd does what Anakin should do, just be a boy and respond to what children should respond. But Lloyd's acting isn't the greatest. He's good at Anakin's more playful and fun moments, but in moments of dramatic tension, he's weak, especially in the scene where the Council refuses to train Anakin as a Jedi. Lloyd doesn't show any emotion in this scene, doesn't even react to this refusal. Also his chemistry with Natalie Portman is a little awkward. But all in all, Jake Lloyd does a decent job at playing the slave boy who would later become a Jedi who would eventually become Darth Vader.

John Williams returns to score another Star Wars film, and does another impressive job. I loved hearing the Star Wars theme again, plus portions of the Skywalker theme during moments of Anakin's maturity, also featuring light touches of The Imperial March. But the best theme in the score is easily ""Duel of the Fates"", used in the climax of the film. The religious, temple-like sound during the epic lightsaber duel is awesome, chilling, and definitely shows Williams as a brilliant composer.

The Phantom Menace is definitely flawed in its characterization and sometimes weak script (the midiclorian bit makes absolutely no sense even after watching it for the millionth time), but I am extremely forgiving of this film. At the end of the day, it's still Star Wars. It's still entertaining, it still has awesome visuals (man that podracing scene blows my mind away!), and it still has awesome action. While it's definitely the weakest of the Star Wars films, I do find it to be underrated. This would be like what The Motion Picture is to the Star Trek films, flawed but still a good watch."

"May 19, 2013",1.5,Its fun when things pick up which is rare but thin story jar jar and medichlorians will keep anybody but children away but does have one of the coolest characters in star wars in the form of Darth Maul but he isn't in the movie or fleshed out enough to provide any real redemption in this boring disappointing cgi snoozefest
"May 17, 2013",4,Not the best way to start a new Star Wars franchise but still an entertaining movie with cool lightsaber scenes so I still recommend it to Star Wars fans and si fi fans
"May 17, 2013",5,"Awesome visual movie, guided by Liam Neeson as the venerable Jedi Master."
"May 17, 2013",2.5,"Loads of eye-popping visual effects and uproarious entertainment make this movie easy on the eyes. What sinks this movie is the very little attention to part of what made the original trilogy great: the chemistry between the lead cast. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor did the best with what they had, but I just didn't buy it, and things got even worse on the acting front when the incredibly underwhelming Jake Lloyd showed up. Ultimately we got an entertaining, albeit familiar, outing in the Star Wars saga, a franchise that was built on going above and beyond simply entertaining."
"May 16, 2013",3,Sure there's corning kid Anakin and annoying Jar Jar Binks.  But this one is still a good watch!  Especially for any Star Wars fan this one helps to establish what the series is about.  And plus the visuals are spectacular.
"May 16, 2013",3.5,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.. Star Wars is back everybody!
George Lucas decided to make a prequel trilogy to show how Anakan Skywalker aka Darth Vader, becomes the menacing villain pretty much of all time. 
The story starts off with a Jedi master named Qui Gon Jin and his apprentice, Obi Won Kenobi who are sent to settle an argument but of course nothing ever goes right and our adventure begins. 
Granted I'll say I actually enjoy this film. It's kinda annoying with Jar Jar Binks and the whole senate democracy bullshit but it had a really sweet pod race scene and a cool lightsaber duel and a sick villain named Darth Maul. Better than the original? Nope not a all but not a terrible way to start off a new trilogy"
"May 14, 2013",1,"Annoying, borderline racist characters and pointless CGI eye candy.  The saga begins with a whimper."
"May 14, 2013",3,"If I were going to introduce Star Wars to someone for the first time, I would first show them 4 &amp; 5, then flash-back and watch episode 2 and 3, and then finish with episode 6. That's right, I would actually skip this one. Now don't get me wrong, It's still fun, it has a lot of pretty cool action sequences, and plenty on eye candy, however, I think Lucas went Style over Story with this one. Let's face it, the events in the Episode II take place 10 YEARS after the events of Episode I. I feel I would be flashing back too far with this one. Not much really happens in terms of how Anakin becomes Darth Vader, I mean sure, we know how they met Anakin, but Anakin as a character just didn't do it for me in this one. I liked him a lot better in the future films. My favorite characters in this film are by far, Obi Wan (McGregor) and Qui Gon (Neeson) they do there best to try and carry and save this film. As for the villain Darth Maul, he looked cool, and could certainly kick some ass, but has very little character development, I mean, heck he hardly says anything. Overall though, I remember watching in the theaters as a kid and loving it, despite not really knowing what was going on, Overall, I personally would watch this film just for fun, but unfortunately, it's not that interesting for a Star Wars film. Sure the battles are intense, but they're much more interesting in the other Star Wars films. just saying."
"May 13, 2013",5,i like star wars so no question about it i got all it dvd now
"May 12, 2013",3,"I know Jar Jar Binks was awful, and I could have done without the pod racing scenes, but it was great to see the modern take a jedi's and a great new adaptation of fighting styles and force powers. Darth Maul is one of my favorite bad guys of all time now."
"May 11, 2013",5,yaaaa i love star wars
"May 11, 2013",3,Leaves room for desire.
"May 11, 2013",3.5,Could have been awesome.  Bad directing made it mediocre.  But it does have the best lightsaber fight ever.
"May 10, 2013",2,"Cast your minds back to the summer of 99. Boy, were we all excited and charged up t see a new Star Wars movie! Flash to the present day, and myself along with many others feel tricked and quite embbaressed  to be honest. Episode 1, is an overlong, badly directed, badly acted movie. Ok, I admit it is sprinkled with some good set pieces here and there. The thrilling podrace, and the duel between the jedi and the sith lord stand out. But overall, this movie was dull. To this day, the movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I feel embbaressed  when I think that I bought into all the hype! Oh, and the recent crappy  3D re release didn't make things better either. Yeah, I paid to see that too! I guess I'll never learn!"
"May 09, 2013",4,"I always hate when people put this movie down, because I really enjoyed it. I understand the criticisms (mainly Jar-Jar and Anakin), but it has a well written story and powerful effects that make it extremely likable, if anything amazing."
"May 08, 2013",2.5,"Alright so you've heard all the criticisms about ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" over and over but when it comes down to it, the movie isn't even so much ""bad"" as it is unnecessary. That's not to say that there aren't a lot of bad elements to the film, it's just that the movie leaves you feeling more cold than angry or upset (which is the mark of a really awful film). The story is often very slow and dull. There are some sprinkles of action throughout, but there is no tension in the story for 2 reasons, firstly this is a prequel so you already know who is going to live and who isn't and secondly, the opponents that our ""Jedi"" protagonists face are laughable. Most of the action sequences with ""Obi-Wan"" and Qui-Gon"" feature them battling endless ranks of bumbling droids. These robots are often used for comic relief, never manage to actually hit or come close to hitting our heroes and are easily reduced to smoldering bits with the swing of a ""lightsaber"". As the movies goes on, you simply stop caring when you see the ""Trade Federation"" army show up guns blazing because you know these guys aren't going to do any significant damage. The other antagonist and the one people remember is ""Darth Maul"" who, you'll be surprised to see if you watch the movie again actually has some spoken lines. They offer nothing to develop his personality and the guy becomes memorable because of his signature weapon and his memorable face more than anything else but it can come as quite a shock that the villain does more than just swing a sword around. Most of the characters in the film are actually quite dull when it comes down to it, with little personality or distinguishing traits apart from their physical appearance. The only characters who actually stands out as having a personality are either the droids, who are simply taken from the later films and inserted back into the sequels (in what feels like a really forced tie-in) or the character ""Jar Jar Binks"". While ""Jar Jar"" might be hated nearly universally for his constant bumbling and ridiculous speech pattern, at least the character is memorable. His physical appearance is quite distinct from anyone else in the film, he actually displays quite a bit of emotion at the events happening around him and while a lot of the character's comedic moments don't really work, he does ironically provide the only real excitement during the movie apart from the action segments.

The plot is muddled and drifts aimlessly without a real main character for a long time and there are a lot of sequences where politics and nonsensical trade route business is discussed. When it comes down to it, there's not a whole lot that happens in this story and the whole movie feels like it should be condensed into an opening crawl for a more exciting ""Star Wars"" film. The entire movie feels forced and padded out to its 2hr + running time and doesn't really provide fans of the series with any cool revelations or interesting insight into the characters they already knew. ""Annakin Skywalker"" gets an origin story, but it feels like a first draft and leaves you puzzled, ""C-3P0"" gets a similar introduction and ""Obi-Wan"" is absent for so much of the film that you don't feel like you got to know the guy at all. There are numerous plot holes and sequences where characters act illogically just so we can insert an action sequence in the film (think of ""Annakin"" being dragged into a warzone just so he can hide inside a ship that is blasting off).

When it comes to the special effects and creature designs, most of the film holds up pretty well, but sometimes it doesn't. There is a glut of computer-generated effects that often make the movie feel hollow. You know that the space battles, the robots, the backgrounds, the aliens, the racing is all generated in the computer so it doesn't have any real weight. When the movie is moving quickly it all looks impressive but when it lingers on some of the effects there are some shots that look pretty bad (a couple shots during the ""Gungan""/Droid battle look like they were taken out of the video game). Oddly enough the limitations of the original ""Star Wars"" films feel like they made the world seem credible because the creatures had to either work as physical puppets or fit as costumes over actors. Some of the designs for aliens in the film look so crazy you don't believe for a second that this could ever be a real creature. Look at ""Watto"" for example, a two-foot tall pot-bellied greasy creature with bat wings that is always flying. Every time you're looking at him you think to yourself ""How did this species come to be exactly?""

This may sound like an obvious point but when the movie is not slow or dull, there are a lot of fun things to look at and in fact, visually the movie is interesting. The crazy creatures, elaborate ships, grand structures in the backgrounds, exotic locations and fast-moving scenes are fun to look at and provide some good entertainment. ""Queen Amidala"" has an elaborate wardrobe that's quite beautiful and there is some pretty exciting fight choreography between the ""Jedi"" and the ""Sith"". This battle is unlike any other we have seen in the other films and in that sense it's nice and fresh. That familiar soundtrack is blasting as you see the characters slash at each other while jumping and kicking and while the constant editing that interrupts the battle is frustrating, it is a very memorable moment in the story.

With this installment, the series has become less accessible to wide audiences and casual fans of the series. Die--hard fans of ""Star Wars"" that just eat up anything from the brand and children will find something to enjoy, everyone else probably not so much. The kids particularly will have a good time with it though, the action sequences move quickly, there's always something weird and crazy on the screen and some of the comic relief, while juvenile will hit the mark for the young audience members. You won't sit through the movie and hate it but the movie does not stand on its own feet. It's the kind of movie you watch to prepare yourself for the other superior ""Star Wars"" films and worth watching/buying if you are curious and want a bit more out of the universe that George Lucas created but not the kind you can see yourself watching every year for a good time unless it's part of a marathon. Despite all of it's fault the movie isn't all bad and comes off as more of a mediocre, mostly forgettable story with some shining moments and a couple of memorable scenes. (Dvd, May 4, 2013)"
"May 08, 2013",3.5,"Episode 1 was probably the most pointless film in the series in terms of story and character development, but it did have some perks that make me think it is slightly underrated."

"May 06, 2013",2.5,"The Phantom Menace is a weird installment in the Star Wars series. It doesn't feel like Star Wars, instead a spoof of it."
"May 05, 2013",4.5,"Slated by Critics everywhere - but it may be blasphemy to say that this is my favourite Star Wars film. Great music, great characters and even a thrilling pod-race to satisfy the audience!"
"May 04, 2013",0.5,"Star Wars! It has to be good, right? No it's actually very bad. I won't even call it Star Wars. I'll call it Star Wars-ish. The Phantom Menace was supposed to be the best movie of the 90's. It was supposed to be an instant classic. But it sucks. Why? It's boooorrrriiinnng! You don't connect with any of the characters. Qui-Gon's character is very dull. Liam Neeson was decent in the role, but there's nothing the Oscar-nominated actor can do to save it. Same goes for Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Natalie Portman is one of the best actresses of our generation. Somehow, her character was probably the most boring. Maybe it was Keira Knightley's fault, because it was mainly the Queen that was boring about her character. There were also some very annoying &amp; obnoxious characters. I'll start with Anakin. Kid actors suck. There I said it. Some are good. The majority are bad. This Anakin never did anything worth while &amp; was the MOST ANNOYING KID I'VE EVER SEEN!!!! ""Yippee!"" Oh just SHUT UP Anakin!! I think we can all agree the worst character to ever come to Star Wars-ish was Jar Jar. George Lucas tries to pull of all these jokes in his script. They don't work. At all. And his voice. Oh his voice. It's the most annoying thing I've ever heard. Then some of the characters like the Separatists or Watto are just flat out racist. Darth Maul was a shining spot (the shining spot) of the the characters. He was highly underused. You have this great Sith, and you use him for maybe ten minutes of the movie. Great job George Lucas. Oh and the dialogue is awful. The overall story looks good on paper. But once you put in the awful dialogue and the poor execution on the director's spot, the movie is awful. The plot twist towards the end about PadmÃ (C)'s character seemed like it was just there for a plot twist. It didn't do anything to enhance the film. Now the few redeeming qualities:
-The Visual Effects
-Podracing 
-The end battle (the Darth Maul one. I could care less about the other 3)
-John William's score 
That's it. I would say that Episode I is an abomination to Star Wars as a whole. If you haven't seen Star Wars (I'm sure 99% of you reading this have) don't watch this movie. It's a waste of your time. Overall, The Phantom Menace is a horrible film. I'll just keep my Original Trilogy close to me. Thanks Mr. Lucas for giving us a low quality Star Wars-ish film. I'm sure he's saying your welcome."

"Apr 29, 2013",1.5,"Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace is just horrendous.  George Lucas made these films because he didn't have a lot of money and there was still a fan base for Star Wars.  The purpose of the prequels is to show how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. So why couldn't they just skip this movie and go to Attack of the Clones? To make more money of course! The kid actor who plays Anakin is just horrible. He does everything by mistake like create C-3P0 and blowing up the bad guys ship completely coincidentally. If I was told in the original trilogy that Anakin made C-3p0 i would have believed it and gone along with it. But after seeing the phantom menace and just how much of an idiot Anakin was it is very hard to believe.  The politics that fill this movie are incredibly slow and boring.  The podrace isn't as entertaining as one would hope, and was just made to make new arcade games.  The ONLY good thing about this movie is Darth Maul. He is an awesome villain who is kind of mysterious throughout the movie. Does this alone make Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Meance a good movie? HECK no."

"Apr 21, 2013",5,"Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace
	Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace, was most likely the first Star Wars I ever saw. This movie was probably many people from this generation's first Star Wars film. I have seen this one and then the original movies (Episodes 4-6). A few years later its sequels (Episodes 2 and 3) came out. Star Wars: Episode 1 was a great movie and really makes sense to have as an ""introduction"" to the saga. 
	The cast for this movie was quite impressive; it included Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala/Padme, Samuel L. Jackson as Master Mace Windu, Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine, Ray Parks as Darth Maul, and Frank Oz as the voice of Yoda.
	The movie had many cool scenes in it. Anything from pod races to lightsaber fights and battles. The pod races were in a sense like many movie races in which there is always that one person who does anything to win such as; crashing into others or messing with parts on your vehicle without you seeing. It was very entertaining nonetheless. The scenes that involved the Jedi knights were very cool. For people who are watching a Star Wars film for the first time, they get to see the force being used and lightsabers being wielded. The most intense lightsaber scene happens at the end of the movie between Qui-Gon Jinn, Darth Maul, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. They were not going to be able to subdue Darth Maul, so it became a fight to the death.
	One thing that bothered me about Yoda was that after 20+ years they still used a puppet. The reason that it bothers me is because in Star Wars: Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones, the Yoda they use looks more realistic and just all around better.
	One thing that I noticed as subtle as it was was that they made a religious reference whether they realized it or not. And it may just be me, but I think they wanted to make Anakin Skywalker ""Jesus."" The reason I think they did this was because of what Shmi Skywalker (Pernilla August) said to Qui-Gon Jinn when they spoke about Anakin.
	Qui-Gon Jinn: ""Who was his father?""
	Shmi: ""There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I've raised him. I can't explain what happened."" 
	Other than that the movie was very interesting, well written, and very entertaining. I highly recommend watching this movie if you haven't seen it and if you have seen it, but not for a while I recommend watching it again. The cast could not have been any better; they all seem to have a good chemistry. This is a movie that any age group can watch and I hope that they do watch this movie."

"Apr 16, 2013",2.5,"Within the annals of Star Wars lore, or just movie history in general, the business of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is something of a sore subject. Here, in one sitting, is the single most anticipated movie in the history of the medium (try to think of one bigger) and the most distressing to a generation that grew up with the hip-cool of George Lucas' original trilogy. They had waited 17 years for its creator to loop around to tell us the story of the rise and fall of one of the most memorable villains in movie history, and the results, for many, did not meet factory standards.

A decade after its initial release it may seem difficult to focus on the film more than on the public's reaction to it, but that really depends on your point of view. Back in 1999, the film didn't meet the overreaching expectations of a cynical audience, most of which were too young to even remember the elation of first seeing the first three films in a theater. For them (not me) their disappointment over The Phantom Menace made it trendy to make fun of Star Wars. Yet, your enjoyment of the new rerelease may depend greatly on where you stand with this series. What are you willing to forgive? Are you willing to drop your cynical hatred of Lucas' infamous meddling and see the film with fresh eyes? It is strictly up to you.

Revisiting the film again I am able to take a step back and review it from a distance without the anticipation or the negative feedback clouding my judgment. I maintain the same opinion now that I had 14 years ago: This is a glorious science fiction fantasy, a visionary work that embellishes the kinds of ideals that science fiction were created for. The colors are bright and vibrant, the visuals are breathtaking and the action scenes, especially the three-way lightsaber dual at the film's climax, still seem fresh. The craftsmanship is top drawer. The story, however, leaves something to be desired.

Where the movie works is in the technology. That's George Lucas' trademark. The best quality of the Star Wars pictures has always been in displaying new worlds to explore and new sights to see. It is clear that Lucas was light-years ahead of everyone else in terms of what went up on screen and I defy you to find one single frame of this movie that isn't crafted - technically - with loving care. The locations are wonders to behold, especially landscapes like the Italian-style vistas of Naboo, the desolate rocky terrain of Tatooine and the glowing underwater pods of Gunga City. They show Lucas' flair for imagining alien worlds that play as a lovely travelogue of places that only exist in the imagination.

Plus, as with all of the Star Wars pictures, there is a wonderful display of Lucas' love of action scenes. All of Lucas' films from THX 1138 to American Graffiti to Star Wars to the Indiana Jones pictures and the recent Red Tails, contain at least one breathtaking vehicular chase. There is no denying that the pod race sequence, a death-defying race through the rocky terrain of Tatooine is thrilling. The advancement of those scenes, which now employ the innovation of computer generated imagery are far gone from the Death Star trench-run on the original. Plus, there's something new in the advancement of the hand-to-hand combat. The lightsaber duals of the original film were based on classic swordplay. Here they seem based more on martial arts. Watch that lightsaber dual at the end again and you'll see what I am talking about.

Where the movie falters is in the characters, and that's something that no amount of technology can improve upon. What made the original trilogy work was that we cared about the plight of our heroes. They were well-defined within an action-packed setting. Here, I still find the human characters to be a bit thin. We forgive young Obi-Wan Kenobi, young Anakin Skywalker, Senator Palpatine and R2D2 and C3PO only because we know that they are characters who will flower over the course of the series. But new additions like Qui-Gon Jinn, Padme Amidala and Shmi Skywalker seem oddly empty as characters. Their personalities seemed dusted upon them lightly like dew. They are mired in a plot that doesn't have time for them to flower as complex human beings. Most disappointing is the relationship between Anakin and his mother, which you might expect to have a little more weight. When a gamble over the podrace leaves Anakin free and his mother a slave, she is forced to let him go. Yet there's something empty about her reaction - her son is leaving her! The scene in which the two depart feels like little more than a student leaving his elementary school teacher at the end of term.

Yet, while most of the human characters seem thin, the one that surprised me this time around was Anakin. As played by Jake Lloyd, there is far more complexity to him than I had notice before. He, of course, is the lynchpin of this entire saga, a kid whose soul will be corrupted, plunging him down in to the depths of darkness before redeeming himself with the help of his son. Here we see him as a sweet-faced little kid, a boy who is industrious, and inwardly anxious for a better life. His young eyes burn with ambition and there are moments when we can see fleeting glances of the frustration that will someday consume him.

The supporting characters that really work are Lucas' gallery of computer-generated aliens. As with his original triology, he packed the frame with 10 or 20 different kinds of creatures at the same time so the world seems to exist beyond just the central plot - we sense that the background characters each have a story to tell. The aliens in this film, for the most part, have dimensions. My favorite is the gravel-voiced Watto, a greedy creature who looks like a strange cross between an aardvark and hummingbird. There's Sebulba, a champion podracer with the face of a Great Dane who walks on his hands. And there's the jovial Boss Nass, a bulbous Gungan who flaps his jowls to finalize an agreement (more curious than a handshake, I think). Then there's the villain Darth Maul, a red and black skinned alien whose creepy presence is effective.

Alas, I must also address the elephant in the room. I cannot discuss the film without touching on the film's chief blunder (and the chief reason that the film is a sore subject), the presence of Jar Jar Binks, surely the single most hated creation in film history. Seeing the film again, I realize that time hasn't improved him. I maintain now what I have said all along: a little of him goes a long way and Lucas' chief mistake was allowing him so much screen time that he seems to take over the picture. Lucas, it appears, responded to the gnashing of fans over Jar Jar because his presence in the rest of this trilogy was severely limited - he got two scenes in Episode II and a fleeting cameo in Episode III. Also owing to the fact that Lucas knows he's made a mistake is the fact that when the film came out in a 3D rerelease last year, Jar Jar was completely left out of the promotion.

Even with that, the experience of seeing The Phantom Menace again was a chance to see it again with fresh eyes. I went in with an open mind, and an open heart. I find it to be a very good film, but not a great one. For everything that works here, I could find something else that doesn't. The film is a mixed bag of successes and missteps. It is easy to hate the film given the public derision hanging over it, but to look deeper is to see a film that is crafted with care, even if its story leaves something to be desired."
"Apr 16, 2013",2.5,Jar Jar Binks? SUCKS
"Apr 15, 2013",3.5,"Yes, it is not the best movie, but c'mon! It is sitll fun, it has nice characters and special effekts. And the story at least make sense and is the beginning for a new adventure!"

"Apr 12, 2013",5,I wonder why took so long to rate My Favorite Series Ever !! I cannot Rate This Anything Less Than 5 as This was Start of Journey which opened most extraordinary doors visually and intellectually !!
"Apr 12, 2013",1.5,"This is a very strange film.  First off, the obvious this in no way shape or form lives up to the original trilogy.  Second, the story is overly complicated, there is so much being thrown at you it's very difficult to know what is going on.  Third, the characters range from okay to boring to an obvious marketing tool aimed at kids that completely ruins the film when he's on the screen, or Jar-Jar Binks for short.   Fourth, there is no main character, the reason for the original trilogy being so successful is Mark Hamill making the audience believe that the story was real, here it's just a mess of uninteresting characters.  Fifth, still on the subject of the characters, they're so unbelievably strange, clearly Lucas had no worldly idea of what he was doing; it's impossible to care about them when there constantly whining, Obi-Wan, supposed to be a professional yet is a complete irresponsible jackass, Qui-Gon, a weird queen with a robotic voice and decoys where she herself lets the decoy be the queen and she herself becomes a decoy, Amadala, and a damn annoying kid that couldn't act at all, Anakin.  These are the biggest problems of the film and it's amazing that with 16 years to get ideas for the film, this is what Lucas came up with.  I'm not going to accuse Lucas of any wrongdoing like selling out or making a two hour long toy commercial, because in all honest compared to the next two films in the prequels this is fairly mild.  The Phantom Menace is no where close to being in consideration of best films of all time, but is one of the greatest let downs of all time.  I really can't recommend in all honesty it's just to uninteresting.  1.5/5"
"Apr 11, 2013",2.5,Slow and convoluted plot.

"Apr 08, 2013",2,"Honestly not the worst, the visuals look nice. But it's so boring, the story isn't interesting at all, and the characters and dialogue are dull. Overall I don't regret seeing the action scenes, but the rest bored me to tears"
"Apr 07, 2013",3,"Because I liked watching it as a kid so much, I don't hate it. In the end though, it's wooden acting and convoluted story plot make this Star Wars movie pretty bland with the exception of some cool action scenes."
"Apr 07, 2013",4,"Starting my marathon of all the Star Wars films, in preparation for The Force Awakens, it only makes sense to start off the story chronologically with The Phantom Menace.

Episode I has definitely a lot of hate from many Star Wars fans and while this film definitely has multiple flaws, I still think there's plenty of things to appreciate about it. 

Firstly, the flaws should be stated as there is plenty of them. There is an over-reliance of CGI and the film definitely could have benefited from more use of practical effects. Jar Jar Binks is an unnecessary, useless and unfunny comic relief character most of the time. The dialogue doesn't always hit the mark. They could have picked a better child actor for Anakin than Jake Lloyd and there are moments of silliness sprinkled throughout this film.

However, I still think there are plenty of redeeming qualities to this film. For one thing, the lightsaber action is simply fantastic (particularly the Darth Maul fight sequence). Darth Maul himself has an intimidating presence as a villain, even though he only has a few lines in the film. The film expands on the Star Wars universe by making us feel like we're in a different galaxy with the spacious and well-designed settings which have a nice aesthetic to them, even more-so than the original trilogy. The pod-race scene is highly entertaining to watch and I liked the way it showed the whole thing, so I felt like I was a part of the race. The John Williams score is fantastic (especially the Duel of the Fates theme). It's nice to see C-3PO and R2-D2 once again and the overall action and flying scenes are exciting to watch.

So overall, my rating is mainly based on my personal subjective feelings towards this film because while there are elements that I'm not a huge fan of, I think the good elements are still enough to overshadow them as I still had a fun time re-watching this film and I was never really bored at any point (even during the political scenes). Objectively, my rating would be lower.

In my opinion, it's worth watching not just in preparation for Episode VII, but also for the good stuff. Discover for yourself if you enjoy this film more than many others do!"
"Apr 07, 2013",2,"A disappointment for good reason. There is no real cohesive plot and the narrative is marred by characters that just don't even matter(Qui-Gon Jin, Jar Jar, etc.). The film's focus is all over the place, so you can't care about anyone or anything on the screen. It's just 2 hours of ""whatever"". 
4 out of 10"
"Apr 06, 2013",2.5,"Despite its oustanding visual effects and sound editing, the first installment of the Star Wars prequel presents a weak plot and character development, and several unecessary characters that will never please fans of the saga (or anyone)."
"Apr 06, 2013",3.5,"While it doesn't fully match the cinematic pleasures of the original Star Wars films, The Phantom Menace is an entertaining sci-fi adventure with fantastic visual effects, two likable leads in Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, and perhaps the greatest lightsaber fight of them all."
"Apr 06, 2013",4,"This much-hyped beginning of the prequel trilogy to the classic 'Star Wars' films (1977-1983) was never going to live up to its marketing or, even more so, the expectations of its devoted fans. 

Although the performances here aren't always as strong as they should be, there's plenty of gadgets, aliens, droids and action, showcasing the depths of writer/director George Lucas' imagination. 

If anything, 'The Phantom Menace' is lots of fun (we know how it all ends, so the excitement is getting there) and proves to be an effective piece of escapism as well as a solid stepping-stone in the lengthy saga."
"Apr 05, 2013",3,"Still the most well-made of the prequels, with plenty of live sets, miniatures, puppets, costumes, make-up, and choreographed stunt work peppered throughout the dated CGI to call back to the original films in our minds and ""feel"" like a true Star Wars film despite its flaws."
"Apr 04, 2013",2,"""The Phantom Meance"" may have some exciting action sequences, especially at the final act, but you have to suffer from a series of exposition scenes that are butchered by robotic acting and uninspired characters."
"Apr 04, 2013",3,"I remember the hype around this movie back in the 90's.  Everybody was so excited that Star Wars was back.  Of course a movie with such high expectations is sure to be a bit of a let down.  The Phantom Menace isn't horrible at the same time it lacks the spirit of the original.  You get the sense that Lucas is following a bit of a formula but of course the first Star Wars never had a formula to follow.  Still the pod race, the introduction of Anakin Skywalker, Darth Maul and even Jar Jar Binks are moments that make the movie unforgettable.  Certainly not the best, but it had a lot to live up to."
"Apr 03, 2013",3,The Phantom Edit is what the movie should have been.
"Apr 03, 2013",2.5,I hate that little kid.
"Apr 03, 2013",3.5,Nothing compared to the original films. It tries it's best to feel like it's still the same universe but the CGI stops it from doing so. But don't get me wrong it's still great to watch.
"Apr 01, 2013",2,"No where near as good as the original trilogy, but it is an enjoyable enough pop corn flick. This movie angered me at first, but then took it for what it was, a children's movie. However, if you don't watch this movie, you will be fine, your not missing out on much."
"Apr 01, 2013",2.5,"The movie event of the decade is finally here, but is it good?

I say it was alright. And really, Lucas has crushed me. His first time directing a film since the original Star Wars and he doesn't do it! The plot line needs work, a lot. And the dialogue? Don't get me started. The characters like for example Jar Jar is the most annoying movie character of all time since Kristen Stewart's Bella. The action and visual effects were the only good thing coming out of this movie besides Liam Neeson's impressive performance as Qui-Gon and Ewan McGregor's performance.

This is a big disappointment, I give it a 5 out of 10"
"Mar 31, 2013",4,it breathed new life into the old. and i didn't think jar jar was that bad
"Mar 31, 2013",5,Amazing first entry!!
"Mar 31, 2013",4,"Liam neeson was great, Jar Jar should be shot."
"Mar 30, 2013",5,"five stars for bringing Darth maul into star wars trilogy. Ps should have kept him around for next films, he was most exciting villian since Darth vader. And get rid of  jar jar stinks or however you spell that waste of movie space nut."
"Mar 30, 2013",3,"To be completely fair, Star Wars The Phantom Menace in spite of it's shortcomings, still has competent storytelling and showcases some noteworthy advances in special effects, and looking back, has plenty of cringey quotable moments which actually work in it's favour."
"Mar 29, 2013",1,The worst of the Star Wars Saga in my opinion!
"Mar 29, 2013",3.5,"Good movie, the podracer scene was boring though."
"Mar 27, 2013",4,"In its own way, Star Wars Episode I is a good film. Dogged more by pacing issues and character/casting problems (Jar-Jar and Jake Lloyd) than anything else, it nonetheless sets the stage well for the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker--and has possibly the greatest lightsaber battle in the saga to boot!"
"Mar 27, 2013",4,Acting seemed kinda corny.
"Mar 26, 2013",4,Two words why this is the best of the new three: Darth Maul.
"Mar 25, 2013",4,i really liked this movie i thought darth maul was so well acted i was very sad when they killed him off in his first film
"Mar 25, 2013",1,"This is, hands down, the biggest cinematic disappointment of all time. Admittedly, I am not a ""Star Wars"" fanboy (nor one of any franchise), but for years, we patiently waited for a ""Star Wars"" movie for our generation and George Lucas said ""forget what my fans what; I'm just going to add as much crap to the screen as possible."" Characters we really don't care much about (No, I don't care about other media besides the films where they explain it more, I CARE ABOUT THE MOVIES), a plot which is too complicated (why can't they just make it a simple good vs. evil story like ""A New Hope"" instead of including a conflict over taxation of trade routes), and special effects that just cloud the screen. One star out of five; if some fanboy defends this movie, just say: ""midichlorian,"" and he will shut up instantly."
"Mar 25, 2013",2,"For the record, I loved this movie as a young kid-- I went to this movie for my 5th birthday party and thus have rosy colored glasses when reflecting on JarJar and little 'Ani'. Unfortunately seeing the movie years later has shattered much of that fond nostalgia toward 'Phantom'. The stilted dialogue, shallow characters, overuse of cgi, and plot filled with senate hearings and trade negotiations (isn't Star Wars supposed to be escapism?) are hard to ignore. The movie has its moments, with an epic podrace and thrilling light saber battle, not to mention the second coolest Star Wars character design in Darth Maul, but sadly a painful watch for anyone over the age of 10"
"Mar 24, 2013",2.5,Cruse you Jar Jar Binks.
"Mar 24, 2013",0.5,"Ugh, do not get me started. Seriously."
"Mar 23, 2013",3.5,"The writing and acting is a big problem, but overall it's a solid entry in the saga."
"Mar 22, 2013",3,My first Star Wars movie. I thought it's a good one considering the visual and sound effects. It's just that the storyline is too generic.
"Mar 22, 2013",2.5,"Uninteresting characters and a confusing plot.  Visually the film is also wildly inconsistent - sometimes an impressive sci-fi fantasy epic, sometimes a goofy CGI-animated kid's movie (pretty much any scene with the Gungans)."
"Mar 20, 2013",3,While I don't see the point of re-releasing the first 3 episodes.I still enjoyed the movie for what its worth (not much)
"Mar 19, 2013",5,"Sorry to all the fake ""fanboys and girls"" who hated this film. Please remember that the Star Wars franchise is made for kids, thus no nudity foul and vulgar language etc. ad nauseum. This story is the exposition of the entire story of Anakin/Vader's life, so yes lots of background story. All in all another great movie that true fans that grew up with these movies (and books) love, and love to be able to show to their kids and grand kids one day."
"Mar 18, 2013",1.5,"I think The Phantom Menace tried to rely more on the fact that it was a Star Wars movie, and less on the actual plot, acting, etc... It keeps on shoving familiar faces on the screen, (through unbelievable 'coincidences') as if to distract you from the mess you're really watching. What a mess it is, though. Completely boring, with monotone acting that manages to ruin what should be exciting moments, Episode 1 is an unnecessary piece that really ruins the spirit of Star Wars. It has visual effects that acts as a bleach to your memory of the movie. Really look back to it, what the hell was the movie about? ""Well, it's uh, about Star Wars and, um ... Anakin... Right?"" I'm pretty sure no one really knows what was going on during this movie, because you shouldn't. It makes no sense. With all of the politics, children, and Jar-Jar Binks, The Phantom Menace makes you feel like you should know what's going on. Disappointing to say the least. George Lucas focused on this movie just to make him some more money. That's what it's all about, really. Not the plot, characters, or theme. The money."
"Mar 18, 2013",4,"It's not as good as the original three, but it's not that bad. The final fight with Darth Maul is definitely the highlight."
"Mar 18, 2013",1,Nothing that happens in this movie makes any fucking sense!
"Mar 18, 2013",1,"Repulsive, annoying, boring, convoluted, nothing makes any sense. This was a money-making scam."
"Mar 16, 2013",2.5,"I recently re-watched this film. As a big Star Wars guy I can confidently say that this is the only bad Star Wars film.  It was clearly watered down to appeal to very young children and those who don't really like Star Wars.  Although it has it's good moments, overall this movie is really a shame."
"Mar 14, 2013",3.5,"Ofcourse, it's not going to compare to the originals, duh. Darth Maul is awesome though."
"Mar 14, 2013",4,"The only Star Wars movie I like seems to be the one every one else hates. I don't know what the difference but this is the only movie in the series that I have managed to sit the whole way through. I like the banter between the two Jedi, the princess' spunk and yes I get a kick out of Jar-Jar Binks."
"Mar 13, 2013",2.5,"It is a good movie, but compared to the three Star Wars films that made the franchise, it falls short."
"Mar 13, 2013",1,Man a total piece of shit.
"Mar 07, 2013",3,3-way lite saber dual at the end kicked ass &amp; was best part of this movie.
"Mar 07, 2013",4,"This is the beginning of the story which takes place ""a long time ago -- in a galaxy far. far away."" It is the start of a new trilogy of one of the most beloved science-fiction franchises ever. However, like the rest of this trilogy, this movie is not perfect and doesn't follow the continuity set in the original trilogy many years ago. 

The galactic government has been weaken, and the planet ""Naboo"" is the next target to the powerful ""Trade Federation."" It seems that nobody will step in to protect ""Queen Amadala"" (Natalie Portman) and her loyal subjects. 

""Jedi Knight Quin-Gon Jinn"" (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"" (Ewan McGregor) are sent to find a settlement, and find a young boy (Jake Lloyd) ""Jinn"" believes will bring ballance to ""The Force,"" a mysterious energy that binds everything together that can be controlled after some training. 

The first thing you will notice is the incredible visuals. It is definitely CGI, but it is absolutely beautiful. I strongly recommend that you see this movie in letterbox format to truly appreciate the visual effects. 

Another thing that stands out are the incredible battle scenes and ""lightsaber"" fights. The battle scenes are filled with CGI, but are wonderfully produced, while the ""lightsaber"" fights are amazingly choreographed and will take your breath away for the speed they are at. 

There are some weak performances, which improve as this trilogy unfolds. There are also some scenes which seem to lag a bit, and are pretty boring. There are also some problems with the audio mixing, especially when ""Anakin"" (Lloyd) speaks in some scenes. 

One big problem is that one of the villains is not only poorly developed, he doesn't get a chance to be a major part of the franchise and only lasts until his death near the end of this film. Personally, I would have liked to have seen him last until some time before ""Anakin"" is seduced by the ""Dark Side"" of the ""Force"" in ""Episode 3,"" which closes this trilogy. In fact, many characters are not well developed in this film. 

Another problem, but minor one, is that there are just too many CGI characters in this film. To me the live actors aren't even looking ""eye-to-eye"" with them when they are ""looking"" at them to ""talk"" with them. In the original trilogy, all the characters are live-action, thanks to the technology of the time. Those characters that could have been CGI if the original trilogy were made today worked much better than the CGI characters like ""Jar Jar Binks"" (voiced by Ahmed Best) and ""Watto"" (voiced by Andrew Secombe). However, the CGI characters are nicely animated into the scenery. 

On the other hand, the wardrobes and non-CGI sets are wonderful. The clothing looks pretty futuristic, but somehow looks like something we'd see today in some cases. And the buildings are beautiful and quite massive. Some of the sets that standout are the exteriors used for the buildings on ""Naboo"". 

Fans of the original trilogy will see some continuity mistakes with the original trilogy. Newer fans may not see these at the first viewing of this film, but will eventually see them. 

Despite some problems with the CGI, sound mixing and continuity errors, this movie is fun to watch. In my opinion it would be a good addition to any sci-fi fans collection, and a good rental."
"Mar 06, 2013",1,The only positive thing about the Phantom Menace is the Plinkett Review
"Mar 04, 2013",4,"Have always thought The Phantom Menace underrated and the latest watch confirms this. When I first saw in the Cinema had a big lump in my throat as the opening credits rolled as it brought back childhood unlike anything else before or since. The movie grows in stature and substance throughout its length (and as Jar Jar shuts up a bit). From the Pod race forwards, it is excellent and a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga."
"Mar 03, 2013",3.5,Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace begins slow but the pace definitely picks up. Though The Phantom Menace is the weakest film in the franchise we still have the opportunity to the origins of the most amazing characters in The Star Wars Saga!
"Mar 03, 2013",5,awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Mar 01, 2013",1,"Terribly directed with the worst phoned-in acting, not even the nightmare-inducing coolness that is Darth Maul can save this film."
"Feb 28, 2013",5,"A perfect beginning (story wise) to a perfect saga, this is one of my Star Wars favorites. The beginning of all..."
"Feb 28, 2013",2,"it is horrible, but at least still have good sfx, but at the same time, it contradicts almost everything about the original trilogy. I think that says it all don't you think?"
"Feb 27, 2013",2,The only thing good about this movie is the cast.
"Feb 27, 2013",5,I don't think it's the best Star Wars movie but sure is better than the animatex version.
"Feb 26, 2013",1.5,"Fail, Fail, Fail, Fail, Fail, and Fail!
Worst Star Wars Ever!"
"Feb 26, 2013",5,"The locations and scenery are beautiful and exotic; the extremely well-done overall design of each planet and the specific places we are taken to is proof of that. From the lush and delectable beauty of Naboo to the vast and overwhelming city-planet of Coruscant, the environments are simply wonderful to behold.
I simply don't understand why the use of CGI in the film is ridiculed as it is-CGI is something created by humans, just like animatronics-I don't believe CGI is ""less human"" than animatronics. The CGI enhances the visual quality of the environment and the characters that are CGI; this was what CGI was created to do, after all.
The action sequences are amazing to behold, especially in the film's 20-minute climax; the pacing was perfect-the quick cuts between the three major conflicts matched the intense, fast-paced style of the battle-George Lucas' mastery in the visual arts was evident in the film.
The symbolism and mythology-a Star Wars hallmark-is still a force to be reckoned with. Darth Maul's image, the duality in characters like Palpatine, and the symbiosis between prevalent organizations are all compelling, as well as the character types.
Speaking of characters, I enjoyed Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Padmé, and Anakin. I was interested by each of their journeys, and where they began and ended. I cared about them, as well; they weren't ""wooden"" and ""boring,"" and nor were the performances behind them.
The writing was good-not written by a 5-year-old-Lucas kept me interested in the characters and the story. I liked the politics involved in the story, as I am very interested in politics. The pacing for the story was good, as well. The supposed ""plot-holes"" are easily explained and/or easily ignored, and are more like nit-picks than actual criticism.
I realize the problems both certain fans and critics alike have with this film-I understand their criticisms, but, to me, they either hold no water, or aren't significant enough to undermine the film, as I see it.
I thought at least some of Jar-Jar Binks' antics were funny; he didn't annoy me, and I'm willing to bet he didn't annoy most of the kids who watched the film. Not only was Jar-Jar a character for kids, but he represents a ""wise fool"" in the film.
Additionally, I hope people realize that this film isn't ""universally hated;"" look at this site-62% of fans gave this film a 3.5/5, and 57% of critics, just 3 points under ""fresh"" status, gave the film a positive review.
All in all, Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace is an excellent film, and a more than worthy beginning to the saga; if you haven't seen it already, it is at least worth watching once."
"Feb 26, 2013",0.5,"Jar Jar, midi-chlorians, droids, The Trade Federation, C3PO built by Darth Vader are just a few reasons why I have a mirror shatteringly bad feeling about this"
"Feb 24, 2013",2.5,"Easily the worst of the series. Jar Jar Binks is almost too insufferable to watch a second time, though it fulfills its purpose in beginning one of the best stories ever."
"Feb 24, 2013",2,"Only the originals, please."
"Feb 24, 2013",3.5,I agree that the movie doesn't have much humor or romance and at times the acting is not up to the standards of Star Wars but nonetheless it is still exciting and a treat to watch. It is also interesting to see how the events of the original Star Wars came to be and how the characters developed.
"Feb 23, 2013",4,the best form the new movies of Star wars!
"Feb 22, 2013",5,5 stars ... Just for Darth Maul...
"Feb 22, 2013",5,"I'm not sure George Lucas should have went this far back in time on the prequel Trilogy. Regardless,though, this movie is excellent. It is the only one out of the three prequels that feels like the originals. Too much flack for Jar Jar Binks. I don't mind him. It became popular, and still is, to make fun of Jar Jar and to say how bad this film is, but the fact remains, this movie is better than a lot of the garbage out there now and the movies at the time."
"Feb 21, 2013",5,I like all star War 5 for rateing.
"Feb 20, 2013",3,Jar Jar Binks is not as useless as people say he is.  At least we know where Anikan came from!
"Feb 20, 2013",3,"A good effort. This film is constantly given alot of shtick by hardocre fans of the franchise. I can relate, some of the scenes are poorly executed and some of the acting here is often constituted as wooden. If you can absord some of the cheesyness, it's rather enjoyable."
"Feb 20, 2013",3,Let's face it.  This movie is pretty awful.
"Feb 19, 2013",3.5,"This film is not that bad as the prequel trilogy haters usually claim. It's not excellent, but it still gives a good story with a bad screenplay. That's the problem, George has been always a terrible screenwriter and obsessed with effects since the first Star Wars was released. If the story would have been given to another director and writer, then I am sure the film could have been better even than The Empire Strikes Back. However, I find it more stupid saying that excess of politics made the film boring... Oh my gosh, if the film was mediocre, then the people who judge like that are mediocres as well."
"Feb 18, 2013",4.5,A really good movie. I like the story.
"Feb 16, 2013",2.5,"A cool character(Darth Maul) dies, and a dumb character(Jar-Jar) lives."
"Feb 16, 2013",4.5,My least favorite of the SW Saga.  Darth Maul was a phenomenal villian who went out like a punk.  Poor ending to an awesome character.
"Feb 16, 2013",5,a great movie it give a backstory to Darth Vader and Hayden pulls it off in an excellent manner
"Feb 15, 2013",4.5,"Not as bad as many reckon, is just not the way people imagined it for 20years!"
"Feb 15, 2013",2.5,"Yeah we saw the re-release, same movie only in 3D, same old story, they should of never killed Darth Maul. . ."
"Feb 14, 2013",3.5,Some great moments with some pretty TERRIBLE performances by some key cast member's...the pod race is cool.
"Feb 14, 2013",5,me and my son enjoy this movie on 3D
"Feb 12, 2013",2.5,"Liam Neeson and Ray Park make the first Star Wars film in 16 years an enjoyable experience, but nothing about The Phantom Menace is on par in terms of quality with the original trilogy."
"Feb 11, 2013",5,The start of something AWESOME
"Feb 10, 2013",3.5,For me it gets a bit better the more I watch.
"Feb 10, 2013",5,I love star wars a lot!!!!!
"Feb 09, 2013",2.5,"I wish i didn`t rewatched this, struggled to finish it,acting and diologue was shit, and Jar Jar Binks man u wanted to strangle that long neck turd..........."
"Feb 08, 2013",3,The only one of the prequels to feel like a Star Wars movie. I'll even forgive Jar Jar.
"Feb 08, 2013",1,"George Lucas sexually assaulted my inner child, Bastard! One star, and that's only for the sound effects in the pod race. Never mind Osama Bin Laden, why isn't the FBI hunting down Ahmed Best?"
"Feb 07, 2013",3,"the only good thing here was darth maul, but even he couldn't save the movie from the wrath of jar jar binks."
"Feb 07, 2013",5,"After the success of Star Wars Episode VI: Return Of The Jedi, 16 years later, we got a prequel trilogy chronicling the life of a young Anakin Skywalker before he became Darth Vader and this film is no option. This is Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. The focuses on a young Jedi apprentice named Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) who is looking to bring balance to the force between the Jedis and the Siths with his current training master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) because the trade routes have been unbalanced due to the taxes. Both Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon land in Tatooine to help fix their ship and they meet a nine-year-old boy named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) who is working as a slave in hope so that one day he will be set free. Qui-Gon believes that he can bring balance to the force because of the highest midichlorion count that is higher than all the Jedis including Yoda (Frank Oz). Qui-Gon makes a bet with the storekeeper named Wotto than if Anakin wins a pod race, he will get the parts he needs for his ship and he will also take Anakin and train him to become a Jedi. When Qui-Gon takes him home to be trained by Yoda and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), they lie that he's too old to be trained even though the maximum age to be trained to become a Jedi is age 13 because they all sense fear inside him. As fights arise, the queen of Naboo (Natalie Portman) sends asks permission to use Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) and his army and this makes Emperor Palpatine (Ian MacDiarmid) to release the droids. Anakin goes into outer space to blow up an entire ship so that he can make the droids go offline while Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon fight off a Sith named Dath Maul (Ray Park). He kills Qui-Gon but is later killed by Obi-Wan. Qui-Gon's dying words were to train Anakin, Obi-Wan gets permission from Yoda to train him and after Qui-Gon's funeral, they celebrate Anakin becoming the new Jedi. I remember watching this film when I was young and I did like it back then, I forgot how epic it was. For those of you complaining about so many pointless crap, what about the pod-racing scene, the fight with Darth Maul, the space combat, the submarine scene, Yoda training Anakin and even the very intro and very end? I know why there are people out there who hate this movie: The dialogue is clunky, the aliens are racist especially Jar Jar Binks and the fact of having a nine-year-old Darth Vader is unrealistically creepy- I get it. But without any of these, you wouldn't have this movie. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace gets a 10/10."
"Feb 03, 2013",3,"Not as bad as everyone remembers, overall. Some very stupid choices made by Lucas and some terrible acting bring it down, but there are a lot of redeeming elements to this one also. The narrative by itself is pretty solid."
"Feb 03, 2013",0.5,"Out of all of the Star Wars movies, this is the worst. Lets begin. So first qui gon. He is not obi wans master, yoda is because if u remember in empire strikes back, obi wan said that he was trained by yoda. The very beginning is stupid. That scene where they try to gas the jedi or whatever, wouldn't it be better to leave the door shut so they will actually die. Then you have the scene where qui gon and obi wan go on separate ships to naboo. Well wht if one of them was found, then the other one couldn't find him. Or wht if they land on opposite sides of the planet. Next is jar jar, the stupidest character in the movie. This guy is annoying, stupid, and completely clueless about anything. Y do they go under water anyways. Do they want to see where jar jar grew up. Next is when they save the queen on naboo. After they defeat most of the droids, 2 of them r just standing there not doing crap and qui gon puts away his lightsaber than kills them. Next is when they're on the naboo ship going to tattoonie and they care about r2. Really? Do u really need to recognize a droid. Next is the horrible kid actor jake loyd who plays anakin skywalker. Y can't he be grown up in this movie. If he was them we can relate to him just like we can to Luke. Next is the kids. The good thing about the original trilogy is that there were no kids in it, but no there has to be some and there's more in the next. Next is the podrace which is probably there just to make money from it, like toys and video games for it. Next is mr. Obvious. It is ric olie who is the pilot in the naboo ship. He points out the complete obvious. Next which is probably the worst thing in this movie which is the politics. The next 30-45 minutes is all boring politics. Even when I was younger, I just played with my Star Wars toys or just left the room. This is just here so the queen can do a vote of no confidence which will get valorum out of power and palpating in. And finally here is the last thing I'm going to talk about is the ending. There's to much going on. The gungan battle doesn't need to be in there. Palme and the naboo people going to capture the viceroy, that should be in the movie. Qui go and obi wan vs darth maul, that should be in the movie. Anakin going into space shouldn't be in the movie. This movie is stupid. And I don't recommend this to anyone. I don't even know y I put a half star on this movie it's more like a no star on this movie because its stupid. Ttyl"
"Feb 02, 2013",3,"To be honest the Phantom Menace, didn't bring about the introduction I desired about the whole Stars Wars saga, but it was a nice movie by its own rights. The problem I believe is from the fact that George Lucas had all the rights to wheel and drive this movie how he pleases, that with no one questioning him, this I believe is the reason I had to deal with 2 hours or less of Jar Jar Binks, who wasn't funny but annoying and his clan was so annoying that I wished the droids wiped them out before young Anakin Skywalker could save them.Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) were the high side of this movie, I was extremely impressed by the portrayal of Qui-Gon Jinn to the point that I just wanted to be seeing Liam Neeson at all times, he was just magnificent and made the movie worth seeing and his presence made it easier to deal with the annoying Character of Jar Jar Binks and his clan.Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is the forth film in the Star Wars saga, it came about from Lucas planning a back story that will connect and give a story depth between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, in the first Star Wars trilogy Vader is said to be Luke's father so this second trilogy is to show how Anakin (Darth Vader) was trained and swayed to the dark side. The movie main protagonist will be Anakin Skywalker, and this first movie of the sequel will be his introduction.The name Phantom Menace depicts Palpatine hiding his true identity as the evil Sith Lord. The movie follows the adventure of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they were to escort and protect the Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) of planet Naboo as she travels to Coruscant as she hopes to end the trade dispute between her people and the Viceroy. Their Journey wasn't a peaceful one as the Viceroy invaded Naboo and they had to flee.During their flight a breakdown of their space craft causing them to land in the planet Tatooine where they met young Anakin Skywalker and also witnessed the return of the Sith, as Qui-Gon Jinn had to defend himself from one.The CGI in the movie is not as impressive as I will expect and but the screenplay is one that will keep the interest of many, this massive box office hit was received with many mixed reviews and I myself have mixed feelings about the movie. It will be a lot easier to enjoy this movie if you have seen the first trilogy, don't try to watch the movie from here up hoping to get the feel.In conclusion, Star Wars is a wonderful franchise a movie plot that can go on and on, I did enjoy this movie but not because of the script or plot which were a 5/10 from my view but because of the performance of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor.www.lagsreviews.com"
"Feb 02, 2013",3,"Wasn't the greatest movie, nor the worst."
"Feb 01, 2013",2,"Though it's certainly a fun time for kids, long time ""Star Wars"" fans  will be unable to look past the awful dialogue, bad plot, Jake Llyod's horrible performance and Jar Jar Binks.  Thus leading to one uncomfortable conclusion: ""The Phantom Menace"" is a bad movie and big disappointment."
"Jan 31, 2013",5,it was a beautiful movie
"Jan 30, 2013",4,"Not as great as the original Star Wars films, but still good."
"Jan 29, 2013",0.5,this isn't pod racing
"Jan 29, 2013",4,Every Saga Has A Beginning
"Jan 29, 2013",2,"The big ""Star Wars return"" was a huge disappointment, Lucas's biggest mistake is to cast Liam Neeson (one of the worst actors ever). Story line was rather dumb, and is no Star Wars material."
"Jan 28, 2013",5,Darth Maul died too easily after defeating a Jedi Master and then being bested by a Padawan.
"Jan 28, 2013",1,A mess of a movie that made the mistake of being reliant on CGI that it now looks more cartoonish and cheap that the original series ever will. Throw in a incoherent plot and boring characters and this one rolls over and dies. One of the biggest disappointments in cinematic history.
"Jan 28, 2013",2.5,on par with a midday made fot TV kid's movie with expensive (but boring and computer game like special effects)
"Jan 27, 2013",1,"A worthless pile of bland nothing. I fell asleep through much of this movie (especially the Pod-Racing scene). The very second Jar Jar Binks cries ""MEESA GO HOME!!"" is the very second I want to see him ejected into the deep empty void of space to freeze to death."
"Jan 27, 2013",3.5,jar jar fucking killed a decent movie
"Jan 27, 2013",2.5,The most anticipated and made the most money and its the worst of the entire SAGA.
"Jan 26, 2013",4,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999) ???
Two Jedi Knights land on a planet where they discover a young boy who may bring balance to the force. Along the way, they face a sinister sith adversary. Exciting, eye-filling prequel to original STAR WARS is well acted, action packed, visually exhilarating. Not a strong source of  humanity, but it's good fun for one and all. Climactic lightsaber duel with Darth Maul is a knockout. Sequel: STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES."
"Jan 25, 2013",1,Biggest waste of time EVER
"Jan 24, 2013",4.5,As a Star Wars fan... I loved it.
"Jan 22, 2013",2,Not as great as I remembered as a kid... corny and stupid story now.
"Jan 22, 2013",5,"meesa day started pity okie day wit da brisky morning munchings!

not exactly what everyone wanted after waiting, what 20 years to see how it all began? although, if you go back and watch the prequel trilogy now, this one makes more sense. AOTC, however..."
"Jan 22, 2013",3.5,"OK start to the new trilogy of Star Wars movies, but suffers because of Jake Lloyd. I love Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon and his character rocks. Otherwise, some good setup plus the best lightsaber fight in the entire series. If only they had done a better job with storytelling... The prequels should have started with Episode II..."
"Jan 22, 2013",1.5,With a villain that doesn't bring wonder to and a bad storyline. A movie based on only special effects. 4.9/10
"Jan 22, 2013",4,by far one of my favs due to AMAZING CGI FX
"Jan 22, 2013",4,"Overly hated by posers, but actually a very good film. Holds up well."
"Jan 21, 2013",3,Nothing much else of it apart from the fight scene between obi wan and darth maul
"Jan 20, 2013",5,I LOVE STAR WARS &lt;3
"Jan 20, 2013",2.5,"Pese a ser visualmente increíble, es muy cliché y simple, y por otra parte, algunos de sus personajes dejan mucho que desear."
"Jan 20, 2013",3.5,An unexpected beginning to the star wars saga possibly from a lack of c3po or lack of the overall original characters everyone loves this movie seems dumb until you watch all the movies in the order 1-6.  However star wars is george lucas creation so I appreciate any thing he does for the star wars universe. Perhaps if we were told more about darth maul and his significance it would have more meaning sadly its focus is thrown all to Anakin which many don't understand is really what star wars is all about the tragedy of darth Vader so I see the focus on a young Skywalker however I would of liked more of a backstory on Qui Gon Jinn.
"Jan 20, 2013",4,This is not George Lucas's best work but it is still a good movie and a good beginning to the whole trilogy. Of course there are some flaws. There were flaws in the first 3 movies but that didnt mean that they weren't good. If the movie was perfect than all you so called critics out there would not have anything to complain about.
"Jan 19, 2013",0.5,"The movie that showed that George Lucas was/is a fraud. The best line I heard after he movie was 'George Lucas the accidental genius."" I almost refer to him this exclusively among friends that want to rip my throat out for my venom toward this film. The funny thing is I have never heard a response to my arguments about what makes the film so bad. The fact is most people just don't want to believe that it is the disaster it is. I give it half a Jar-Jar."
"Jan 19, 2013",1,"Booooooooo. And, Booooooooo."
"Jan 18, 2013",3.5,"I still like this film a lot, although Jar Jar does grate on one's nerves"
"Jan 18, 2013",3.5,"Finally. this movie starts to close the gaps from the 4th, 5th, and 6th movies."
"Jan 17, 2013",2.5,What can I say? It's Star Wars! I only wish the story was half as good as the action and special effects which breathed fresh air into the first prequel!
"Jan 17, 2013",3,What can I say. It's Star Wars. The 3D wasn't worth it but the story nonetheless is alright
"Jan 16, 2013",3,worst one of the series
"Jan 16, 2013",3.5,"Kind of boring, but most beginnings are. Still really good, and I'd definitely recommend seeing it if you're into Star Wars."
"Jan 15, 2013",4,I really can't stand those star-wars purist fan-boys. It's really not that bad a film.
"Jan 14, 2013",3.5,"My least favorite Star Wars movie. 3-D did look great. And I got to see a Star Wars movie in the theater with my daughter for the first time. It's got the best light saber duel in any of the movies. Qui Gon Jin &amp; Obi Wan taking on Darth Maul while John William's Duel of the Fates blasts out of the speakers. It sends chills up my spine everytime. For me, Jar Jar isn't the biggest problem.  That would be Jake Lloyd. The kid couldn't act. Everyone told me at the time, ""He's just a kid.""  I would just shrug. Then at the end of the summer, The Sixth Sense came out and Haley Joel Osment was brilliant. If only George Lucas could've picked a kid half that good."
"Jan 13, 2013",2.5,"El mérito de las películas de Star Wars no cabe duda que está en una apreciación conjunta de todas, ya sea de cada trilogía o de toda la saga. Cuando te detienes a examinar cada una de ellas por separado,  lo que encuentras puede ser gratificante o también puede ser algo decepcionante. Lamentablemente, esto último es lo que sucede después de una mirada crítica a la primera entrega de la última trilogía, Star Wars I: La amenaza fantasma. 
Pero comencemos con aquello que no falla, aquello que es bueno encontrarlo en esta primera entrega. Por un lado, tenemos el universo consistente en que se desarrolla la película. El mérito está presente en toda la saga y esta  no es la excepción. La historia que nos presentan, en líneas generales, es interesante, bien construida y muestra atisbos de lo que veremos en las posteriores entregas. Un universo creado con tal maestría no podría resultar en otra cosa. Sí, soy un fan de Star Wars. Por otro lado, la película entretiene. Creo que para todos aquellos amantes de la acción pueden quedar satisfechos y aquellos amantes de la saga, también. No olvidemos que hay algunas escenas memorables que hacen de la película digna de ser vista y disfrutada.
Pero aquí viene lo malo, y como quisiese que no fuese tan malo pero lo es. Para comenzar,  los personajes. Es realmente sorprendente que con actores de peso como Liam Nesson y Samuel L. Jackson se logre tan poco. La construcción de los personajes es pobre y estéril. Luego, y por si fuese poco los diálogos son terriblemente decepcionantes. Uno se pregunta dónde aparece el carisma de Hans Solo o la fuerza de la princesa Leia, pues no busquen tanto porque no los hay. Lo más cercano es el insoportable Jar Jar Binks con un screenplay que no le favorece y un pequeño Anakin que realmente no conmueve. Además,  la historia presenta unas deficiencias que solo podrían entenderse en una film infantil. La repentina habilidad del joven Anakin para destruir la nave enemiga, la batalla tan artificialmente armada entre Qui-Gonn Jin, Obi-Wan y Darth Maul, la muerte de Darth Maul, que de hecho era el único personaje con una construcción inciial interesante, etc. Finalmente, todos estos tropiezos hacen que los elementos políticos de la historia y los mensajes que se supone debe ir transmitiendo parezcan extremadamente clichés,  con los que solo  los niños estarán completamente satisfechos.
Bueno, ahí lo tienen. No creo que sea una película del todo mala, simplemente que palidece en comparación con el resto de la saga, lo que hace que sus carencias y errores sean más evidentes.  El problema, es que la magnitud de los errores que comete George Lucas con esta entrega hace que sea imposible no sentirse distraído de los momentos, aunque pocos, buenos de la película."
"Jan 13, 2013",3.5,"Wow, where do I begin.  I saw this 3 times opening weekend, and loved loved loved it.  Because it was Star Wars and I was mesmerized by the notion of a new Star Wars film.  Of course eventually I realized ""meh, not so much."".  There is much good in this movie, and much much garbage.  The ranking is as high as it is only because it's Star Wars."
"Jan 13, 2013",5,I love darth maul I believe people take the prequels as misstep i believe it's a lot better a lot of other film but the original films real always be the best
"Jan 13, 2013",3,"Phantom Menace has some impressive CGi and fight scenes, but Jake Lloyd as Anakin is annoying as well as Jar Jar Binks, and the plot is not so good."
"Jan 11, 2013",4,"Why this movie has such a bad rap among fans is beyond me. Was the kid that bad?  Did Jar jar Binks rip your childhood away?  The scenes on Tatooine, especially the pod race, added a dimension not seen in the original trilogy.  Was it perfect?  Absolutely not. Was it a great ""set the table"" film?  I thought so."
"Jan 11, 2013",0.5,"Ugh. Bad. Bad direction, horrible script, it's a disgrace to the star wars franchise!"
"Jan 11, 2013",2,"Oh boy, where to begin. A story that makes no sense, a group of the worst characters possible with terrible lines. Over-done special effects abound and the only cool person gets very little screen time and is killed in a ridiculous way. Way to screw up Star Wars Lucas!!"
"Jan 10, 2013",3,"I love the Star Wars franchise being able to see the  environments, characters, ships, evil vs good stories, etc., and the episode 1 delivers that.  However, it is disappointing on the strength of plot and dialog.  I really didn't care if Anakin was 10 years old and about his someday wife was Queen of Naboo.  That relationship really didn't work for me.  Episode 2 could of have take place in Episode 1.  Episode 2 could been during the Clones Wars.  Either way the movie loses it's hold and at the end we really don't care about the characters we invested watching.  It feels like this movie sits alone from the other episodes with no real relevants to the larger scope.  Anakin starts out as kid who cares.  If he started out as a Jedi about 17 or 18 like Luke and he met Padme maybe I would care and how their relationship mattered I would care about them.  Anyway, I give this movie 3 stars for the fact Lucas realized that we as fans wanted to return to his universe of Jedi and Sith, planets, space battles, aliens and unanswered questions from the last trilogy.  Special affects are not bad here either along with the light saber battles.  Watch it once, it won't be worth again.   BTW, the 3D version was added later and didn't make it better."
"Jan 10, 2013",3,"finally watched it n don't regret waiting so long to do so... it was ok, but just not one of my fave..."
"Jan 09, 2013",3,"Most of the reasons that I liked this movie have to do with the fact that it had been so long since a Star Wars movie came out.  Taking out that factor, this movie was ok at best.  Jar Jar Binks is the worst character ever to be put on the big screen, and the whole ""anakin was an immaculate conception"" plotline was ridiculous.  I guess it would be hard to live up to the expectations that this movie had to live up to, but even still...it could have been a lot better."
"Jan 09, 2013",2,shit shit mesa dont like this movie. C-
"Jan 09, 2013",4.5,"I remembered really liking this movie, and then I saw it in 3D, and my opinion was still the same as it was when I first saw it when it first came out...!"
"Jan 09, 2013",3,"The ultimate guilty pleasure, I can see why people despise it but I adored it as a child so now I treasure it. However I did watch it one time and think it was painful. But yeah Jar Jar should die."
"Jan 08, 2013",2,"Thanks a lot George. Everything about it went wrong, the CGI, the acting, and the writing just isn't there. HOW COULD YOU SCREW THIS UP."
"Jan 08, 2013",1.5,"Okay, let's face it: If episode I would have been the first star wars movie, there would not have been a episode II. If the only (good) thing everybody remembers about a movie are some eye-candy scenes (and I am talking of course about the pod race and the double light sabre duel), you know your movie is in trouble, because it fails on all other levels: storytelling, character development, acting, pacing and tone. This movie feels like a well-calculated commercial product that should deliver to all audiences, but it's all about a shiny surface and nothing beyond that. And let's not forget about Jarjar, the most annoying character ever to be put in a movie."
"Jan 07, 2013",4.5,"I don't hate this one as much as most... In fact I think it's just about the finest of the prequel trilogy. Jar-Jar isn't in it as much as you think you remember, and he's the worst part to endure. Otherwise, young Anakin is actually likeable here before Hayden ruined the character, pod-racing is badass, Qui-Gon and young Obi-Wan are worthy Jedi, and this film has possibly the best lightsaber battle of the entire series. Yes, there's some cheese, but what's to complain about?"
"Jan 07, 2013",2.5,"Weakest Star Wars. With the exception of Darth Maul, the characters were underwhelming."
"Jan 06, 2013",3,"This was one of the first movies I saw multiple times in the theater, and I remember enjoying it a lot more then than now. As I've gotten older I realize, like many other people I'm sure, that it was the superficial elements of the movie that I liked at the time. As a part of the generation that grew up with Star Wars, I would have seen this film in the theaters regardless of its quality, but it saddens me some to see that it doesn't stand the test of time like its predecessors. The reasons are obvious to me now that I'm an older man - a convoluted, over-complicated plot and dull characters, (Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn being the sole exception in my opinion. Maul was cool, but shallow as a character.) The original films were simpler, plot-wise, had better characters, and the difference shows in terms of quality."
"Jan 06, 2013",0.5,Jar Jar. Enough said.
"Jan 06, 2013",1.5,"Midichlorians, Jar Jar Binks."
"Jan 06, 2013",2,Jar Jar Binks ruined the whole movie.
"Jan 06, 2013",2.5,"I am not a fan of Star Wars. But this is the only one I can stand. There are many parts I like in this movie, but also many that I hate. If you are a fan of space/alien movies, or have been born recently you must see."
"Jan 06, 2013",4,"Surprisingly enough I really enjoyed it. The visuals were amazing, the cinematography wasn't incredible but it was still good, and the acting was actually pretty good from Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor."
"Jan 05, 2013",2.5,jar jar binks could have been kept out and the story could have been told better with more depth
"Jan 05, 2013",2.5,"Should have made so many changes in the script and in the acting. Still, Star Wars: Episode 1 retains enough of the originals to be an acceptable part of the saga."
"Jan 05, 2013",3.5,"Lloyd is terrible, but Neeson is wonderful and it helps you understand Vader from the beginning."
"Jan 05, 2013",2.5,"The hype for The Phantom Menace was about as insane as it is for the new Star Wars movie. Fans were ready to return to that galaxy and relive the adventures that they grew up with, and introduce a new generation to a realm of fantasy and adventure. Too bad what they didn't know was that the end product was about as interesting to watch as C-Span on a congressional holiday.
Since its release, The Phantom Menace was met with mixed reception by fans and critics alike, but unfortunately what you mostly see today is the hate. Personally, I think this movie gets more crap than it deserves. It's still not a good movie, but it's not the spawn of Satan that most Star Wars fans would tell you it is. With a movie franchise that has as much money and, dare I say, even effort put into it, there's bound to be some good things about it that should not be overlooked. So lets fairly judge it on it's own, and not compare it to the other films in the series.
The Good
One of the elements that Phantom Menace gets right is the atmosphere. From the title sequence to the end credits, you still feel like you're in the world of Star Wars thanks to the advances in technology. You get to see a lot more of the vibrant worlds around this galaxy. The movie just feels huge in size and scope. Sure most of it is green screen and Cgi, but the movie still does it's best to bring you into this world of crazy alien life and huge battles (for the most part). And given the fact that most computers at the time were grey cubes that could barely say ""hello,"" the effects were pretty impressive for their time.
The casting is also great. The performances not so much, but that's not their fault. Sure Jake Lloyd as a young Anakin Skywalker has a lot of horrible line deliveries, but so does everyone else! Are we really going to blame Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson for their bland deliveries? Of course not! They're just trying to survive bad direction. Not to mention they do have their moments to shine. One of the better scenes in the entire movie (that's not an action scene) is where Anakin says goodbye to his Mother (played by Pernilla August). Both actors undoubtedly have good chemistry and you genuinely believe them to be mother and son (despite their completely different sets of genetics). It's a really underrated and well executed scene. Had the rest of the movie been acted this well, it would've been a lot better.
The only actor who really stands out is Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious (The Emperor from the original trilogy whom this movie is named after). He plays a great politician, leader, and a chilling manipulator. His character is set up nicely, and he makes some of the more uninteresting scenes watchable to say the least.
But easily the best element of Phantom Menace is the action. Most notably the lightsaber duel at the end between Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson), Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor), and Darth Maul (Ray Park). Sure it looks a little too clean and a lot like a dance at times, but that doesn't mean it's not fun to watch. And any time Ewan McGregor is in an action scene, he just looks like he's having a blast just throwing down. Unfortunately, the action is restricted to the very beginning and end of this movie, with an overlong Pod Race and a small confrontation in the middle. The movie tries to make up for it by having the finale be 4 different action scenes going on at the same time, but it just becomes very convoluted from there, and you only kind of care about half of them going on. At least we still got the kick-ass John Williams score to get us through it.
The Bad
Oh boy here we go.
First, I'll address the elephant in the room. Jar Jar Binks (AKA the cinematic equivalent of syphilis) is the most annoying ""character"" in all of cinema. And I'll end it there for there's enough ranting about him all over the internet.
When you don't compare it to the original trilogy, The Phantom Menace mainly suffers from two major aspects. Bad directing, and poor writing.
Like stated before, every performance is bland and monotone thanks to Lucas' crummy direction. He doesn't care whether or not he gets emotion out of his actors as long as the shot is angled right and the lines are said. Cut. Print. Let's grab a cup of coffee and call it a day.
The writing... good god. This is easily the worst thing about the movie. Almost every line of dialogue is monotone exposition with only a select few lines being reaction lines, and it drags the film's pacing through the mud. The plot of the movie is that these two offensive asian stereotypes are invading a forest planet because the Queen (played by Natalie Portman) didn't pay taxes or some shit. Truly riveting stuff. Two Jedi are sent to protect the Queen and conflict ensues.
Ok. If you have a movie called ""Star Wars"" with a trailer that promises action, adventure, romance, and all that good stuff; the last thing anyone wants to see is freaking tax evasion. This is where the Phantom Menace really dropped the ball. Audience's wanted to be engulfed in an interesting story that leads to great adventure, but what we got was endless amounts of tax and political exposition with some action scenes thrown in as trailer fuel.
It drags the movie on in the slowest pace possible throughout the entire middle portion. They spend what feels like 2 weeks on the desert planet Tatooine, with the somewhat exciting Pod Race, and then they head to the city planet Coruscant and that's where every human being alive gets bored shitless. The audience is just beat over the head with all of this political talk that nobody in their right mind would ever find interesting, let alone with all these bland performances. Nothing happens in this portion. It eventually gets to the point where the characters decide ""Screw it!"" And head all the way back to the forest planet to take out the threat themselves. Good guys win. Qui-Gon dies. Nobody cares. The end. Yay.
Verdict
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is the definition of a mixed bag. The visuals are nice for their time, the musical score is phenomenal (as expected), and it does have some good dramatic and exciting moments here and there. It's just that getting to them is such a drag! The monotone acting and the exposition heavy dialogue (with little attention to detail) really make all the non-action scenes a real snooze to sit through. I don't think it's the worst in the series like a lot of people do."
"Jan 05, 2013",2.5,People were telling the Star War films parts 1 - 3 were rubbish but I seem to remember them as being ok so decided would re-watch. Erm gotta say think they were right. Scrip POOR. Not sure whether we watch 2 and 3 now.
"Jan 05, 2013",2,"Forget Jar-Jar,  the god-awful dialogue and Darth Vader's virgin birth. The really unforgivable thing here is the utter lack of relevance this movie has to the rest of the series. No one cares how C-3PO and R2-D2 met."
"Jan 05, 2013",3.5,"Eye candy, yes, but the acting is at its worst here...sometimes felt boring, but it does provide a good story on a young Anakin &amp; Obi-Wan."
"Jan 05, 2013",3.5,"Featuring a group of heroes with one of the most irritating and annoying sidekicks in cinema history.  Jar Jar gives the film child humour which will do everything but entertain anyone over the age of ten.  One of the first few CGI created characters the effects are goofy and do not hold up well.

The film to it's credit does feature some real sets and locations which the next two films in the saga ignore.  The finale battles are incredibly breathtaking.  The lightsaber duel at the end is incredibly ferocious energy even if lacking the emotional turmoil of the original trilogy.  The villain is as evil as needed, and makes an impression even if not developed in character at all.  It only makes him more mysterious and intriguing as a character though because Maul dies as quick as he arrives.

The roots and back-story of the saga's main character is a worthwhile journey to undertake for me.  While the story can seem clunky in some parts, in the overall scheme of things it's a good effort.  The dilemma's feel worrying-some enough and there are some sad moments that will move most cinema goers."
"Jan 05, 2013",0.5,"Quite a horrible movie. Uneeded characters (I'm looking at you, Jar-Jar) and many drawn out scenes that were not necessary."
"Jan 04, 2013",4,"Most people call it crap but I saw it when I was 8! It was the first time I was exposed to the world that is Star Wars, so I hold a special place for it in my heart. There's no denying Darth Maul is a badass mofo. Plus I loved Jar Jar as a kid...somehow. lol"
"Jan 04, 2013",1,"could be better, than little kid was annoying"
"Jan 04, 2013",3,Visual improvements don't make up for a boring story and not so good and relatable characters that made the original trilogy so epic.
"Jan 04, 2013",3.5,"Despite what people say, I consider this to be the best of the three latest films. Original, funny. It is not like the first trilogy, but still you can feel the force around the characters in this film and you don't get bored at any moment during the film.
It's entertaining."
"Jan 04, 2013",3,"good, probably the one ive seen the most"
"Jan 03, 2013",2.5,"While it was great to be back a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, with the exceptions of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor channeling Sir Alec Guiness, a tragically underused Darth Maul, and that one shot at the end when Palpatine says he'll be watching Anakin's career with ""Great Interest"" this movie was just embarrassing."
"Jan 02, 2013",1,MORE DARTH MAUL!!!!!!!
"Jan 02, 2013",4,"Perhaps it helps not being a diehard Star Wars fanboy, but The Phantom Menace still feels like an enjoyable film even with its shortcomings. The story is hard to follow with an overwhelming political backstory, and the overall story doesn't live up to the epic adventure of the original films. But the lightsaber battles are the best so far, and it's a joy to revisit the Star Wars universe and to see familiar characters in a different light."
"Jan 02, 2013",3,"The Phantom Menace squanders a good premise and a fresh start. Star Wars fans will be moderately pleased, others will be left crestfallen. Particularly with the appointment of Natalie Portman, who doesn't seem suited to the role at all, as with Liam Neeson, who somehow becomes wooden. It isn't horrendous, but it tries to be something its not, leaving fatal flaws obvious to even the most novice star wars fan."
"Jan 01, 2013",4,it's a good movie except for that dumb Jar Jar Binks
"Dec 30, 2012",5,I like how it tells the backstory of the originals. As a die hard Star Wars fan the flaws I see about this film is young anakin talks a little to much and jar jar is annoyig but funny.
"Dec 30, 2012",2.5,It is not bad but I think that it could have done with several characters and with less CGI
"Dec 30, 2012",1.5,What is there to say about this movie what hasn't been said already? This movie sucks! The End!
"Dec 30, 2012",2,"Not even a luminous 16 year old Natalie Portman can make me like this long, boring mess of a movie. In the language of Yoda, ""Star Wars this is not."""
"Dec 30, 2012",5,personally my favorite star wars movie....
"Dec 30, 2012",3,"A very cool way to get Star Wars into the next generation with a prequel to the old films. I cool cast and characters, but needs a bit more story."
"Dec 29, 2012",3,The kid who played Anakin gets more annoying with subsequent viewings.  Could have used FAR less Jar Jar.  But Darth Maul was so awesome.  Would have liked to have seen his role expanded.
"Dec 29, 2012",4,"At first, you are thinking ""What is a Jar Jar Binks and why did he ruin this movie"" but if you train yourself to IGNORE HIM (its hard) then the movie is actually quite good.  I've found that its one of the easier for me to re-watch over the others."
"Dec 29, 2012",2.5,"It's sad that this has to be included with the other Star Wars movies, which are all great."
"Dec 28, 2012",3,the first true chapter of star wars! my favorite of the prequel trilogy. Liam Neeson is great in this film! a great start to the series!
"Dec 28, 2012",2,"Of the much touted and over-anticipated prequels, this was the best one. Everything was new and interesting, the chracters gave hints at depth and history, leaving you wanting to know more... too bad the next two movies fell flat."
"Dec 28, 2012",3,Not enough Darth Maul
"Dec 28, 2012",3,"Jar Jar Binks might one of my least favorite characters ever. With that aside the fight scenes are very entertaining, as well as the race scene."
"Dec 28, 2012",3,Really an average beginning story.
"Dec 27, 2012",3,Exciting to step back into the world of Star Wars but loses itself with massive amounts of cgi . Darth Maul and a young Obi-Wan are the best things about this entry . Still very enjoyable to say the least.
"Dec 27, 2012",3.5,Good film. Not the best out of all the star wars films but still a good one. It definalty brings a piece of the story all together.
"Dec 27, 2012",2.5,"It's not bad, but I think George Lucas lost sight of what the original Star Wars films brought to the table."
"Dec 26, 2012",4,star wars. nuff said
"Dec 26, 2012",4,"Incredible special effects, awesome fight sequence, interesting story line, poor story development - Lose Jar Jar!"
"Dec 26, 2012",3,What the fuck is this shit?
"Dec 25, 2012",4,"It is kind of childish, but the story is involving and the characters are lovable. It could have been taken a little more seriously, but it is great fun. Special effects are amazingly made."
"Dec 25, 2012",2,Special effects are the main reason to see this movie...the birth of the Binks and bad acting era in SW
"Dec 25, 2012",3.5,worst star wars film but its better than most films
"Dec 24, 2012",0.5,"Bad writing, horrible directing, devoid of characters, and lacking any common sense. This is how to not make a movie everyone."
"Dec 24, 2012",2.5,"I think we can all agree this sucks.The huge let down that disappointed fans around the world,but isn't as bad as it's sequel.The affects were revolutionary,but at what cost?We have messy story that involves mostly politics that will bore you to tears,and most of what you wanted is in the last 50min of the film.All of us wanted jar jar dead because he was comic relief that just wasn't funny.The redemption for the movie was a hand full of scenes that I thought were quiet enjoyable.2.8 stars.It's watchable and suprisingly enjoyable,but the follow up to this.....episode 2.Oh God why?!"
"Dec 24, 2012",2.5,"Want to murder a classic franchise for the sake of money. Then write a senseless prequel with laughable dialogue, throw in about 2 characters to connect it to the original trilogy, create a completely different universe and hire one of the worst child actors this side of Full House. The only redeeming quality is the final lightsaber duel, which is probably the most intensely choreographed in the series."
"Dec 24, 2012",4.5,Good movie. biggest complaint is with the addition of Jar Jar Binks
"Dec 23, 2012",1,"There's a reason everyone hates George Lucas now, and this is it."
"Dec 23, 2012",1,Not sure how this movie could have gotten any worse... and then they introduced Jar-Jar...
"Dec 23, 2012",3,Kind of a disappointment!!!
"Dec 22, 2012",3,"I'm not going to lie, it has problems, but it is not nearly as bad as some people like to say."
"Dec 22, 2012",4.5,"Nunca me había llamado la atención Guerra de las Galaxias, pero aún así decidí ver esta película, después de verla me volví un fan de Guerra de las Galaxias.

Ahora ya las he visto todas."
"Dec 22, 2012",1.5,"Call me ""Old School"" . What can I say Darth Maul 5 stars , Jar Jar no stars. This movie was a disappointment for me. All I can say is this movie made me sad ... sad, that it had the ""Star Wars"" name on it."
"Dec 20, 2012",2,AS A BIG A ANTI CLIMAX AS XMAS!
"Dec 20, 2012",1,"Bad, just...bad...I'm sure that when it first came out I was blinded by wanting it so much to be better than it was. The convining has worn off long ago and I join the many fans in saying how horroble this movie is."
"Dec 20, 2012",3.5,Hot bad dude... need I say any more?
"Dec 19, 2012",3,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, is probably the weakest of all the episodes; there are pointless characters that are not interesting, charismatic or even annoying, as well as some moments, but still, it has its charm and enough stuff (like the final battle against Darth Maul and the still epic score of the legendary Williams) that saves this episode to be bad or worse."
"Dec 19, 2012",3.5,The original trilogy will always be classic - but I have found a new love for Star Wars rooting here.
"Dec 19, 2012",2,"A hollow and ultimately unsatisfying film where the impressive special effects completely overwhelm the mediocre writing and two-dimensional characters. The climax of the film is especially disappointing, as instead of defeating the 'Phantom Menace' through wit, intelligence, or prowess in battle, the child hero overcomes the army of killer 'droids by... sheer accident.
I expected much better from the creator of episodes IV-VI, and it's painfully obvious from this film that George Lucas has sold his soul to the Almighty Dollar, going from a gifted storyteller to a tawdry seller of overpriced toys and merchandise."
"Dec 19, 2012",1.5,"OK, a few things to say about this film; as a Star Wars fanatic I found the film to be ""OK."" Not great. Or awesome. Just OK. Just alright. As a movie buff... Eeh? What the heck was this? It was great to see how the Jedi were before the Empire, but after a few fights it just felt like god-mode on a video game. Boring and unchallenging. The main characters were never really in mortal danger they were pretty much on top of things. The podrace was boring and so was the political scenes. The only interesting part of the movie was the final lightsaber fight and the naboo taking back the city. Those parts were fairly relevant. The gungans felt a little forced and unnecessary. The space battle would have been fine if the kid hadn't been up there. That was the most forced thing about the film is how much the Aniakin (spellcheck) character is on the screen. Why did he have to be a 8 year old? Why not make him a teenager? He'd be more relevant and more likable not annoying and forced. There are also some issues of how the more doesn't match with the original trilogy and how we're supposed to believe that other things match up with the original trilogy, but not everything has to be directly connected and it feels in the way of what could have been a really good story, instead of a cash grab."
"Dec 18, 2012",3.5,"its not as good as the old ones, but its still fun"
"Dec 17, 2012",2,I watched it I wanted to really like it but there was to much cgi and it got old really fast I yawned through the whole movie
"Dec 16, 2012",0.5,I almost don't want to write a review I am so upset about how the prequels came out.
"Dec 16, 2012",0.5,Just... don't... watch it.... ever....
"Dec 16, 2012",2.5,We must kill jar jar binks
"Dec 16, 2012",3.5,Not bad I bought it.
"Dec 15, 2012",2.5,"While it maintains the pedigree of the prequel trilogy by having spectacular visual effects and thrilling action sequences, ""The Phantom Menace"" suffers greatly from dull acting and uneven pacing."
"Dec 15, 2012",4,Great movie. Watched this with my fiancé last night since she's never seen them. Going to go thru all of them again before the new one comes out.
"Dec 14, 2012",3,"While not the best in the prequel trilogy, it does have great visual effects, great score, and a very iconic villain, Darth Maul aka the second most famous Sith Lord."
"Dec 13, 2012",0.5,The only good things about this was sitting next to my son and seeing that he was enjoying it. Then he became a man and rightly cursed it.
"Dec 13, 2012",5,who knows what's in store haha
"Dec 12, 2012",2,"Garbage.  The originals were classics, but these new ones are just awful.  So said, because George Lucas really destroyed something wonderful."
"Dec 12, 2012",3,Being the first Star Wars movie i saw as a kid...i have to somewhat like it. Nothing compares to the originals tho.
"Dec 12, 2012",5,"Great beginning, already gets you wanting to know more and hold u to then end and beyond. Always bill be, the best."
"Dec 11, 2012",5,The reason why I started watching movies.
"Dec 11, 2012",2,"Good effects, but the character development was bad and the plot was boring. Not a very good movie."
"Dec 11, 2012",2,"The worst Star Wars movie, thanks a lot to Jar Jar."
"Dec 11, 2012",1.5,"The only good thing about this movie is Darth Maul, everything else sucks"
"Dec 10, 2012",5,Star wars fan. LOVE IT!
"Dec 10, 2012",0.5,Why was Anakin Skywalker a little kid? Darth Vader became less masculine with this adaptation. When I was a child I thought of a story that had Anakin as an older Jedi and the story began when he was Han Solo's age. Darth Maul is great character but lacks depth. When I met your father he was already a great pilot? At the age of ten??????
"Dec 10, 2012",5,The menance is a real bad dude.
"Dec 09, 2012",3.5,"I watched this movie again, and it's not as bad as I remember it being. Does it have problems, yes, but it's still entertaining, and it's still worth watching again"
"Dec 08, 2012",0.5,"The only good thing about this movie is Darth Maul. But no matter how awesome he is, the movie is still not worth the price of a movie ticket or DVD."
"Dec 08, 2012",1,if they used darth maul throughout the trilogy and gave character development a shot in any of these 3 awful movies I would score it higher. absolutely awful movie though. awful.
"Dec 08, 2012",2,Midichlorians my fanny
"Dec 08, 2012",3,"Admittedly the worst of the six Star Wars films.  It was almost too full of ideas and niftiness.  Nevertheless, it is still great story telling and marvelous science fiction of the highest order.  While disappointing in terms of the standards set by the first three films, it still holds its own in the milieu in which it is intended.  Maybe a little excuse is necessary - it is hard to hit the mark 6 times - but given the love some of us have for Star Wars, it is a decent discovery.  Just remember - watch Episodes IV through VI first."

As imminent conflict brews between the powerful Trade Federation and the peaceful planet of Naboo, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi travel to Naboo to warn the Queen of the galactic fallout which is to follow. 
Eventually, Naboo is invaded forcing the Jedi's to evacuate the planet with the Queen and her court. They travel to the desert planet of Tatooine where they meet a slave boy called Anakin Skywalker who is evidently one with the Force. 
They enlist his help in fighting the war, while the Jedi's confront one of the Dark Sith behind the invasion, Darth Maul, while his master Darth Sidious continues to lead the invasion as a "" mysterious phantom"" pulling the strings behind the scenes.

Truth be told, it was all but impossible to go into this movie without &lt;b&gt;HUGE&lt;/b&gt; expectations. Like countless other Star Wars devotees around me, I sat in my cinema seat with a full house expecting nothing less than cinematic magic. 

As the lights went down and the first notes of John Williams' triumphant score began to play, the entire audience erupted into a cheer of  ecstatic elation. This was it! We had waited ages for this film, but now it was finally happening! 

Few could've foreseen the crushing disappointment that awaited us. The trouble began long before the infamous Mr. Binks reared his CGI head on to the screen. From the outset, it was clear that film-making technology had advanced since the days of the original trilogy- unfortunately for us, Mr. Lucas' gift of storytelling appeared to have atrophied.

The laundry list of mistakes in this film has been lamented countless times across the Internet, in homes, and film classes all around the world- wooden dialog, poorly developed  2D characters, bad casting (much love to Samuel L, but he makes a far better Shaft than a Jedi), and those god-awful medicholorians.  

The music, effects, fight scene's especially the climactic end climax battle is breathtaking choreography used.  &lt;i&gt;Liam Neeson&lt;/i&gt; in my mind was exceptional as the fatherly mentor yet with some un-Jedi like tendencies. 

But in the end, the downfall of Episode I (and indeed, the entire prequel trilogy Clones &amp; Sith) stems from the director's infatuation with his own digital technology.
 In the documentary ""From Star Wars to Jedi,"" Mr. Lucas stated that, &lt;i&gt;""A special effect without a story is a very boring thing.""&lt;/i&gt; 
As I left the cinema that day in 1999, trying desperately to convince myself that I had loved the movie, I was reminded of those words which proved remarkably true, this was a film that dazzled the eyes but did nothing to stir the soul."
"Dec 06, 2012",1,"[2/10] With negligible character development and a feeble plot, The Phantom Menace is possibly the worst movie in the Star Wars saga. [2/10]"
"Dec 06, 2012",0.5,I can literally feel the seconds passing as I watch this movie. It's like watching paint dry.
"Dec 06, 2012",5,Not the best one... but I love Star Wars... so that's my story.
"Dec 06, 2012",1,There's no doubt about it- this is a BAD movie
"Dec 05, 2012",3,"Not terrible, but I still can't believe I waited so long for this."
"Dec 05, 2012",3,lightsabers are cool
"Dec 05, 2012",3,"Second, First Star Wars...lol"
"Dec 04, 2012",5,"The best of the Star Wars franchise. Features the best action packed sequences of all six films. (i.e. Podrace, Duel of the Fates, Battle of Naboo)"
"Dec 04, 2012",3.5,not as bad as people make out
"Dec 03, 2012",4,Darth Maul is the Best Villain Ever.
"Dec 03, 2012",3.5,"Visually stunning with many memorable sequences, however, the plot and relationships between characters left a lot to be desired."
"Dec 03, 2012",5,My favourite of the newer star wars movies
"Dec 01, 2012",3,The opening act of the prequel trilogy has a strong storyline according to me but it suffers from poor direction and the prequel-istic disease of connecting every damn thing in the movie to the original series. With an excellent cast in the bank the film fails to deliver ultimately and serves as a huge disappoint to all . Also the visual effects are way too bad to represent a fictional world.
"Dec 01, 2012",4.5,"Im really sick of the complaints for this movie by star wars fans. Minus the minor annoying things like Jar Jar (actually like that character) or the possible droids.  But this for me was just a really fun star wars movie, and included a really nice mood/idea with it. Thumbs up for this movie."
"Nov 30, 2012",4,Maybe TOO many special effects and not enough good acting....Jar Jar was annoying but the Pod race was awesome....a lot of fun overall....
"Nov 30, 2012",3,... not a big fan of star wars but it was ok
"Nov 28, 2012",3.5,I waited in a line to see this. All good except for jar jar
"Nov 27, 2012",2,George goes back to the beginning and messes-up a great story with a bunch of prequels that don't quite cut it with the rest of the movies. nice eye candy though
"Nov 25, 2012",3.5,in the beginning!!! i love movies that start from the beginning where it all started. long but worth it.
"Nov 24, 2012",1,the worst star wars ever
"Nov 24, 2012",2.5,"decent enough if it was anything but star wars, so its a bit of a let down. still there is enough action and visual thrills to keep most people entertained. no classic star wars story twists"
"Nov 24, 2012",1,"Its significant problems start with trying to do too much - a problem that rarely deserves to be called a problem. But in the case of ""Menace"", there's nothing else besides the bloated storytelling to pay attention to; the visuals are underdeveloped and the performances are nothing to take note of."
"Nov 24, 2012",4.5,"Yes, the plot seems rather unattractive for the younger viewers that the original triolgy attracted, but the battle seqences, scenery and (some) of it's performances make up for it."
"Nov 23, 2012",4,"In spite of some missteps, the film is solid entertainment and sensuously gorgeous, kicking off the fascinating story or how Palpatine manipulates everything to bring down a galatic government."
"Nov 22, 2012",3,"Great movie to pop in if you know the drinking game... NOT for people who enjoy Star Wars, movies, good stories, or anything that makes people happy."
"Nov 21, 2012",3,"As a Star Wars fan I have to say that I enjoyed this film despite the often poor acting, somewhat weaker characters,and a plot that is not that amazing. Scenes like the pod race and the final lightsaber battle are enjoyable nonetheless"
"Nov 21, 2012",2.5,"Episode 1 is the hit &amp; miss of the saga.
The characthers are either dull, bad acting(Ani is insufferable), annoying or a horrible puppet Yoda(thankfully CGI'd in Blu-Ray). They just don't have that charm that the characthers from the original trilogy have. The plot also suffers from dullness. I know Star Wars has some political background, but why would you make your legendary space adventure filled with war &amp; creatures from other world's, be mostly focused on politics? It's bantha fodder.
Now the good stuff here shines in my opinion. Now, there isn't really too much excitement in the movie, but when there is, it's amazing.
The visuals &amp; SFX are resposible for this. Every world looks stunning(the Gungam underwater home in particular). The podrace scene is way too long, yes, but so amazingly done. It's a thrill to watch &amp; hear(Ben Burtt is a genius). One of the best scenes in the saga Im sure.
The jedies may not be the most interesting guys here, but seeing them in action is worth watching the movie. The final lightsaber duel between Qui Gon Jinn, Obi Wan Kenobi &amp; Darth Maul(who looks badass, but suffers the fate of Boba Fett unfortunately) is just epic &amp; tense alone, but with the master of movie music scores, John Williams, Duel of Fates feels omnipotent.
It is dull &amp; dissapointing mostly, but it gets great at times &amp; it is watchable."
"Nov 19, 2012",1,"One must ask, why did this movie happen? It doesn't feed into the next movie or any of the other movies for that matter. A total waste of time and money, meeting young Skywalker is the only purpose this movie fulfills a total dud. And I have to wonder who is the phantom menace? Darth Maul? No way he was in the movie for maybe 4 science out of 50. So it wasn't him, is it the emperor? Why have Darth Maul on the movie poster and cover if he is an irrelevant character, at least use him more."
"Nov 19, 2012",1.5,"Not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. But still, pretty bad.

The story was way too fluffy, the characters were dumb and racist, and there was too much of a reliance on CGI. The battle sequence between the Gungans and the Droids looked like gameplay footage from the first Halo, for Christ's sake."
"Nov 18, 2012",3,Star Wars will NEVER get old. :) Great movie
"Nov 18, 2012",4,"The perfect beginning to an all-out amazing series...I don't understand at all why this movie deserves a 57%, but somehow it does. Thanks a lot, Rotten Tomatoes. That's why it's called ""Rotten""."
"Nov 17, 2012",1.5,"Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace is just horrendous. George Lucas made these films because he didn't have a lot of money and there was still a fan base for Star Wars. The purpose of the prequels is to show how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. So why couldn't they just skip this movie and go to Attack of the Clones? To make more money of course! The kid actor who plays Anakin is just horrible. He does everything by mistake like create C-3P0 and blowing up the bad guys ship completely coincidentally. If I was told in the original trilogy that Anakin made C-3p0 i would have believed it and gone along with it. But after seeing the phantom menace and just how much of an idiot Anakin was it is very hard to believe. The politics that fill this movie are incredibly slow and boring. The podrace isn't as entertaining as one would hope, and was just made to make new arcade games. The ONLY good thing about this movie is Darth Maul. He is an awesome villain who is kind of mysterious throughout the movie. Does this alone make Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Meance a good movie? HECK no."
"Nov 16, 2012",3,Hated Jar Jar Binks !!!!!!
"Nov 16, 2012",2.5,already saw it same old same old but Yoda looks so cool to me and funny to my little cousin I always just watch the Yoda fights
"Nov 15, 2012",4,goodness! why does everyone complain about this movie its not bad at all i love it jar jar may be annoying but this is still a good movie i don't see why there are all these bad reviews i'm a fan of starwars. I LIKE THIS MOVIE!!
"Nov 15, 2012",3,this movie is ok now but i used to love it when i was little.
"Nov 14, 2012",2.5,Never saw the 3D because it sucked so bad.
"Nov 14, 2012",4,I waited 16 years for this film.  Nothing could match the anticipation for it.  So probe rely a lot better than it reputation.
"Nov 12, 2012",2,A huge kick in the nether regions from GL
"Nov 12, 2012",5,great start of many to come
"Nov 12, 2012",1.5,"Jar Jar Binks I hate you! you ruined this movie, and also young Anakin you made it extremly boring! This movie was a travesty and almost made me not watch the next two!"
"Nov 10, 2012",5,action packed movie love this movie
"Nov 10, 2012",3.5,"Wait the force is just bacteria in your blood?  What happened to the cool zen explanation from the forth (first) movie.  And that's not all..  I want to like it more then I do, but..."
"Nov 10, 2012",4.5,I never really liked Star Wars but I liked this movie
"Nov 09, 2012",3.5,"In my opinion the only bad thing is Jar Jar BInks and his ridiculous behavior and voice.  He manages to copy Wayne's World and BIll Cosby's Himself.  Great action between the pod race and the lightsaber battle between Darth Maul, Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jin is amazing.  This movie sets up the prequels very well."
"Nov 08, 2012",2.5,"What senile exec green-lighted this? Oh, right George Lucas."
"Nov 08, 2012",5,"Its the phantom menace, nuff said. If you take star wars REALLY seriously this is just crass but if you love a good bad movie like me, check it out."
"Nov 07, 2012",2,"Just as shit as the original, but in 3D."
"Nov 07, 2012",2.5,"The pacing is terrible but the action, CGI and creativity are all pitch-perfect. If you're seeing this in 3D, avoid it."
"Nov 06, 2012",3.5,Okay except for Jar jar binks
"Nov 06, 2012",1.5,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was the most cringe worthy prequel to the greatest movie trilogy. How could you mess up something so bad? The bad thing is that you canâ(TM)t ever forget that they existed and they are going to be around, FOREVER. I hate how everyone in my age group thinks that âStar Warsâ? was the most boring thing ever because the light saber dual between Ben and Vader was boring because they just stood there. Well you know what!? That had way more emotion then when they fought at the end of Revenge Of The Sith. If you think Iâ(TM)m wrong, then quit reading this before I prove carefully how much of a fucking idiot you are.

	Nothing in this freaking movie makes sense. I feel like a six year old with a box of colored pencils wrote this, and if that did happen it would be a lot better than what Lucas wrote. I feel like he wrote this whole movie in one draft and everyone involved with the making of this movie said they liked it because they just wanted to suck up to George Lucas. I also think no one had the balls to tell him that his script sucked and he is a incoherent jerk. I also think at this point every person thought a new Star Wars movie would be a instant hit. Lucas probably at this point fired anyone who questioned him. I hate this movie...."
"Nov 05, 2012",3.5,"Not great, but the visuals were outstanding for almost ten years ago, and the lightsaber battle near the end was phenominal."
"Nov 04, 2012",3,"I honestly have fewest gripes about it. A bad intro, yes, but had the least problems than the others that got more burdened as time went on."
"Nov 04, 2012",4,"Star wars Episode 1 is not the worst film in the saga, it's a very good and awesome beginning. I have also seen this in the 3D release, but the 3D was not so good, it has one effect in the beginning in the movie. The movie is also well-maded, exciting and entertaining. The script is not bad and Jar Jar Binks didin't ruin this film and he's not boring, he's funny. Worth to see the film! Rankning: Three strong stars"
"Nov 03, 2012",2.5,"For someone who has never seen the original trilogy (I'm watching them chronologically), The Phantom Menace begins horribly but picks up and is capable of entertaining, even if we have to suffer through like Jar Jar, under-developed characters and the overuse of CGI and green screen effects. What helps this movie is the franchise's  mythology, good action sequences and Liam Neeson."
"Nov 03, 2012",3.5,"Liam Neeson did terrific as Qui-Gon, but the plot kept on changing and I didn't feel the character's emotion like I have before."
"Nov 02, 2012",3.5,"Nothing special- but remember folks rated it low because for the first star wars movie released in 2 decades they expected better everything.

I do admit the acting was dicey at times."
"Nov 02, 2012",5,this was good. I liked the first three better.
"Nov 01, 2012",4.5,"There are a lot of times while watching this film that I think to myself ""what the heck was George Lucas thinking?"" Particularly when it comes to Jar Jar Binks and young Anakin Skywalker. But Darth Maul is a beast, and it is still freaking Star Wars!"
"Nov 01, 2012",2,"It came out when I was 10 years old and I did enjoy it, but now that I'm older I can see that it's complete and utter garbage. Lucas really screwed up on this one, he should've just left things as they were. DEATH TO JAR JAR BINKS!"
"Oct 31, 2012",1.5,"A shockingly bad film, filled with tirelessly awful scripting and set-pieces."
"Oct 31, 2012",3,"Yeah.... No. Get rid of Jar Jar, and this could have been light years better."
"Oct 31, 2012",4,it has been a long time since i have seen it.
"Oct 31, 2012",0.5,Star Wars: Death of a Franchise. Pretend this movie was never made.
"Oct 31, 2012",5,"Oh my ruff, Jar Jar Binks is totally awesome and a dog's best friend!"
"Oct 31, 2012",1.5,It was apparent that Lucas was very rusting when he made this movie. I saw it 3 times int he theater to make sure that I wasn't insane and that it really did suck.
"Oct 31, 2012",2,"There are two memorable components in this film.....Liam Neeson and the Darth Maul character. Everything else is so ridiculous, it just collapses."
"Oct 30, 2012",0.5,They raped my childhood!!!! :)
"Oct 30, 2012",3,Not the greatest but worked to set up the whole story. The connections to the originals were ruined but there were slight connection to it. New characters were soooooo annoying (You know how Mesa mean).
"Oct 30, 2012",3.5,it should be 4.5 stars but something happened and they changed my rating
"Oct 29, 2012",3,"I remember seeing this when it was first released in 1999, having just seen the original trilogy a few years earlier. I remember all the hype about it being the first Star Wars movie in 16 years. I was very excited about seeing this, this movie created a new generation of fans, as we see the origins of Anakin as a little boy. Unfortunately, many audiences were disappointed. When I first saw it, I really enjoyed it, I was 9 at the time, and when I finally got it on VHS, I would watch it over and over again on the weekends. However, as years passed by, I began to realize this movie was not as good as it couldve been. As much as I would like to say I loved the movie, I am sorry to say that, I agree with most of the rest of the fans. It was a disappointment to the rest of the saga, its been 13 years since it was released, and it still sucks the big one. First, I am going to talk about the one element of this film that got the most hate, Jar Jar Binks. In the long run, Jar Jar is the comic relief of this movie, and it's okay to have that kind of character as part of the mix, I mean the originals had Chewbacca, and he did pretty alright. But there is a point when it starts to get pushy, and Jar Jar, while I like him as a character in general, he just doesn't fit in a Star Wars movie. Mostly, he was just a laughing stock for the kids, and if one looks at the prequels, you will see that they were more aimed towards kids audiences. In the case of the originals, while they work for kids, the films didn't go out of their way to entertain kids only. The originals were meant for audiences of all ages. Of the saga, Phantom Menace is definitely the weakest, mainly because Lucas wanted more kids to enjoy it. The podrace was pretty awesome to watch, some think it was the best part of the movie. Though it doesn't add anything to the story, hence I prefer Lucas didn't add anymore scenes to it, and that he just stuck to what he released theatrically. Some think there was too much going on in the Battle of Naboo, but I think everything was essential. Some would take out the space battle, but then where would be the 'Star' in 'Star Wars'? Look at the title people. The land battle with the Gungans however, while it was essential as the diversion of the battle, there didn't need to be so much of it. The throne room battle was most definitely essential, and enjoyable to watch. THATS the Star Wars I remember. And the fight with Darth Maul was pretty epic. Two Jedis against one Sith lord with a double bladed lightsaber. THATS awesome, and the fight was well choreographed. With all this, it still falls flat as the weakest of the series, but don't get me wrong, all sagas have to start somewhere, and I do admit I do like the movie, but it could've been so much more, and I'm glad to say that the next movie did have a some improvements, most namely, Lucas toned down Jar Jar, and a few other things improved in the sense of the audience it was aimed for. This one was just a rare mistep, no one is perfect, and everyone makes movies like this every now and then. However this movie is still essential to the rest of the saga, and a must see if you are true Star Wars fan. It's not a total loss, so go ahead and give it a watch."

"Oct 28, 2012",1.5,"The visuals still make parts of this film watchable.  But the lack of any clear protagonist or vital exposition, along with the shoddy plot, sterile acting and sheer amount of glaring logical errors, still makes Phantom Menace just as lifeless as when i first saw it aged nine."
"Oct 28, 2012",5,"George Lucas brings us a great modern epic space opera led by Lian Neeson's character, the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, which gives the audience an huge and familiar presence only rivaled by the late Sir Alec Guinness. The attention to detail is fenomenal which helps to make the fantastical universe a living entity of its own. The plot is more mysterious and serious than previous the ones from the previous chapters, the characters are charismatic, and it's a fantastic backdrop and starting point for the whole saga."
"Oct 27, 2012",2,"Liked it when I was a child, but watched it again recently and found it pretty crappy."
"Oct 27, 2012",2,I'm sure Jar Jar Binks ruined the lives of a lot of Star Wars fans.  Perhaps the worst movie character ever.  Tell me how 22 years pass since the original and the special effects look worse here than the original.  Yoda looked way better as a muppet.
"Oct 26, 2012",3,"It's not quite as bad as people make it out to be, but that doesn't mean I like it that much. Darth Maul is instantly one of my favorite characters in film history, and visually the film is stunning to look at, especially considering that it came out in 1999. But there are so many useless plots going on, unneeded characters for comedic relief, a bunch of action sequences going on at once, and Anakin and Obi-Wan had 0 lead up for the sequel. It needed so much more, but had so much less."

"Oct 24, 2012",2,"If you loved the original trilogy, prepare to be shocked by the disaster that is 'Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.' Bad acting and an annoying Jar Jar Binks drives excited Star Wars fans to disappointment."
"Oct 24, 2012",0.5,"I keep wondering what the most hard-core Star Wars-fans thought when they first saw The Phantom Menace. After the original trilogy and screen absence of 16 years, what were people given? They were given this awful, overly long, noisy, badly written and simply repulsive turd that feels more like a Star Wars-parody.

The Phantom Menace is a very rare film in the sense that it's so bad that you don't know where to start berating it. There is simply nothing positive on display here. Some cool visual effects perhaps, but that is quickly forgotten when you start thinking about any other aspects of the film.

I'll just enumerate some of the worst things. Number one, the film is completely devoid of character depth or complexity. The characters of The Phantom Menace don't progress or engage interest. They simply are, exist only to have some minor relevance to Anakin Skywalker's journey to a jedi and then to the dark side. Qui-Gon Jinn exists solely so he could die in the end and then tell Obi-Wan that Anakin is the chosen one and that Obi-Wan must train him. Darth Maul only so there could be a couple of cool lightsaber battles, and Jar Jar Binks... ugh, even mentioning that name makes me sick. Jar Jar Binks exists to provide comic relief, and it is an attempt so clumsy and desperate you want the character killed off immediately when it arrives on screen. Binks is the most annoying and obnoxious movie character of all time, period.

The dialogue is pain for the ears. George Lucas has never been a master of dialogue (and has admitted it himself), and the worst lines if the series are not heard until Attack of the Clones, but The Phantom Menace's dialogue just feels like a rip-off of the original trilogy's self-assertively epic lines.

But what frustrates most about the film is its plot. The Phantom Menace is a terrible 2-hour and 15-minute mess, a feast of incoherence, stupidity and boredom, bereft of the memorable characters (Han Solo and others, Jabba Hutt, Boba Fett and of course Darth Vader), unbelievable twists (""I am your father"") and the overall narrative simplicity that made all the original films so enjoyable. The good old-fashioned good vs. evil-stories of the original films have been replaced with numerous pointless subplots (the pod race, Padmé's body double) and some stupid political muddles concerning taxation and trade federations.

The performances of the film are terrible all the way. Jake Lloyd and the young Natalie Portman are absolutely horrible in their roles. There is loads of very capable child actors working today (in HBO's ""Game of Thrones"", for example), but Lloyd and Portman are just shamefaced, but that is mostly because of Lucas' poor direction. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor don't even bother trying, and even Samuel L. Jackson can't save the film, even if he said his famous trademark ""motherf****r"" even once.

The Phantom Menace will go down to history as one of the biggest monuments of crap seen on screen that betrayed the spirit of the original trilogy. It is all style over substance, substance that Lucas has desperately tried to generate, commanded by his lazy direction, churlish script and terrible performances. If this had been the first Star Wars-film I ever saw, it would have probably had some kind of effect on me. This is more of a children's movie (though the plot is far too complicated to be understood by children), and that is not what a Star Wars film should be, they should be powerful and memorable space adventures suitable for all ages."
"Oct 23, 2012",3,"40% great, 60% not so much. it is a nice intro into the world of star wars for little ones. Darth maul vs obi wan and quigon is still one of the  best figs in the entire series. plus this movie gave us Duel of The Fates, arguably John William's best music from the entire prequel trilogy."

"Oct 22, 2012",3.5,"It's a fun family movie. It doesn't live up to the name ""Star Wars"" that Lucas made for himself, but the movie itself was good. It just wasn't a slam dunk like you would expect. The special effects of course are amazing."

"Oct 17, 2012",2.5,"I can't help but feel that if this weren't Star Wars, it wouldn't get nearly as much hate. That being said, this is still pretty bad with boring politics, dimensional characters, and JarJar....C-."
"Oct 15, 2012",3,There is one word that describes what I think of this film: Meh.
"Oct 15, 2012",2,"God.  After all that time, what a disappointment."
"Oct 14, 2012",5,one of the best star wars movie
"Oct 14, 2012",4,"While undoubtedly stale, Episode I offers for the most part good acting, crisp visuals, and a powerful, compelling, yet overlong story.

Verdict: This is a real hamdinger of a movie, so get it on DVD."
"Oct 14, 2012",2,"As I get older this movie only gets worse. As a little kid I loved it. The lightsaber fight at the end is cool but once you look beyond all the eye candy, this movie doesn't hold up at all to the Star Wars legacy. The story makes absolutely no sense. I could go into detail but this video explains it much better:

"Oct 13, 2012",1.5,"Sterile, meaningless, unimportant and boring as F**k. Maybe Anakin was important, but the way they made his story up in this movie sucked big time.  And Darth Maul is so f***ing overrated."
"Oct 12, 2012",4,"This is without question, the weakest of the six main films, but I still enjoy it for what it is despite having the eternally annoying Jar Jar Binks and some slight racism. The action scenes are pretty cool, the special effects still hold up nicely, it has the classic Star Wars score, and I found it to be a lot of fun to watch despite being admittedly corny. I enjoy it, and I always will."
"Oct 10, 2012",1,"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace remains to be one of the greatest examples of a franchise-killer in terms of story, originality, dialogue and character development."

"Oct 10, 2012",0.5,"A glistening, beautifully muscled 6' 6'' contender for the title of Worst Film Ever Made.  By itself it would be a baffling, boring 2 hour long advert for toys.  As the first prequel for none other than Star Wars, it is unforgivably bad on every level, from the shockingly bad script through the whole film-making process to the often  awful post-production CGI.  No Darth Vader, no stormtroopers, no excitement, no fun - the complete cinematic antithesis of the original trilogy.  Good thing Lucas wasn't allowed near the Indiana Jones movies again..."
"Oct 09, 2012",3.5,great final fight scene.
"Oct 09, 2012",2,"Not without it's entertaining sequences, The Phantom Menace suffers from not so great acting, a slow middle act and too much attention to the less-serious aspects of the story."
"Oct 08, 2012",3,"Visually dazzling, and often exciting to watch, George Lucas' first film in the prequel trilogy has enough enjoyment to be had to make up for the poor dialogue, stale acting, and the dull moments scattered throughout."
"Oct 07, 2012",3.5,"Great to see the franchise back. But man, what a change. The effects, of course, ""looking"" better than the previous trilogy. But in no way better used. I still prefer older movies with puppets than with CG alien lizards moaning &amp; fighting. Very decent acting by the cast. (Besides the little boy.) The pod race was unnecessarily long. But the final fight scene, very well done. Not too over choreographed and not too unbelievable. An unforgettable fight scene. (Darth Maul deserved a better death though IMO.) All in all a very nice and fun film to watch. That's why I gave it 3 1/2 stars, an equivalent to a 7 out of 10."
"Oct 07, 2012",1,The Phantom Menace is poorly written and irritating.
"Oct 07, 2012",3,"The weekest of the star wars saga by far, but I still feel it gets too much hate. It's not as good as the Original Trilogy, but if you look at it as a film in it's own right, I think it's decent. It has a lot of problems (obviously), but I think it's a good introduction to the saga &amp; it has one of my favourite lightsaber duels in the whole saga!"
"Oct 07, 2012",5,This is a sci-fi epic of the century the star wars franchise kicks ass with the phantom mentace from action and adventure from start to finish leaving you to the edge of your seat
"Oct 06, 2012",5,a five star masterpiece
"Oct 05, 2012",4.5,The 3D was ok...could've been better. I liked though! It's Star Wars
"Oct 05, 2012",5,i think my fav star wars film
"Oct 05, 2012",2,A disgrace to the franchise but at least it is watchable.
"Oct 04, 2012",2.5,"The end result when George Lucas is left to his own devices: am empty, irrelevant story with little regard to cinematic grace and fluidity.  However, it should be commended for its dazzling computer animation, which legitimizes Lucas' otherwise ridiculous imagination."
"Oct 04, 2012",2,haha... long awaited but a disapointment over all!
"Oct 04, 2012",3.5,"Too childish in the long run, but still keeps the essence of Star Wars intact. Good entertainment, if not taken too seriously. Darth Maul is a superb new villain, though without enough screentime."
"Oct 02, 2012",4,"Picture it...  A small Colorado theater on a cool night in May.  Everyone is sitting when the lights go down and the epic drumming and fanfare begin to play that can only be associated with a Star Wars movie.  The crowd erupts in applause as the Lucasfilm logo appears, and the classic opening scene and scroll for Star Wars begins.  A little over 2 hours after those anxiously awaited first few minutes are gone, everyone is leaving the theater, some are a little upset (like me) over the disgusting overuse of CGI, but everyone is glad that the first 3 episodes of the Star Wars Saga are finally being told.  Written and directed only as George Lucas can, Phantom Menace is a delicious prequel that kept us all screaming for more and expecting nothing more than sheer cinematic genius."
"Oct 02, 2012",3.5,"Most Star Wars fans really dislike this addition to the series, but I actually enjoy it a bit. The movie is quite problematic with more entertainment value than deep emotion or story, but I find it to be a good start to the prequels. The effects, score, and memories this withholds for me make it all worthwhile in the end.

PLOT:When the galactic Trade Federation cuts all trade routes to the planet Naboo, two young Jedi are sent to negotiate the disagreements out. These Jedi include the young apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). However, when the Trade Federation becomes hostile under the Sith Lord's rule and starts sending battle droids to invade the planet, the Jedi must act and save Queen Amidala (Keira Knightley), the Naboo leader. Along the way, the Jedi meet many faces, including Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), a clumsy Gungan from Naboo; and young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a very skilled boy from Tatooine with much hidden power in the force. With these small alliances made, the Jedi and Queen decide it's time to act and fight back against the Trade Federation, freeing them of their treaty idea and freeing them for all trade. It's a decent plot executed fairly well.

ACTING:The acting in this movie is fairly good. There are some good and bad performances. The best performances would have to be from Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson as the wise Jedis, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn. These two seemed to play the best parts as the movie's leaders. Keira Knightley, Natalie Portman, and Ray Park also played excellent roles as Queen Amidala, Padme, and Darth Maul. The return of original actors Anthony Daniels, Ian McDiarmid, Kenny Baker, and Frank Oz for C-3PO, R2-D2, Chancellor Palpatine, and Yoda was pretty awesome as well. The voice acting was about as good as the live acting here in some cases.

SCORE:The score here is brilliantly done by the great composer, John Williams. Williams takes this Star Wars movie's score and turns it into a beautiful thing, from intense battle themes to calm and curious compositions, with ""Duel of the Fates"" being the key track in the movie's soundtrack. Williams seemed to really do a great job on this one.

EFFECTS:The effects in this Star Wars movie are actually really great. The visual effects of the planets from Naboo to Coruscant are very well done; I have to say the Naboo city is one of the most beautiful fictional cities I've ever seen. The effects of the aliens, also, from Jar Jar to Sebulba, and even to Boss Nass and the battle droids. Along with the score, the effects would have to be one of the best things about this movie.

OTHER CONTENT:Most fans seem to hate this addition to the Star Wars canon, but I actually like this one a good bit. The movie may have not much of an exciting plot, some apparently annoying performances, and a completely different feeling from the original trilogy, but this seems to start off an entirely new generation to the Star Wars franchise. This was the first Star Wars I ever saw, and I have to admit, it has stuck with me throughout my childhood and entire life. I just like the way George Lucas did everything; however, the lack of emotion and a tangible plot seemed to throw the movie into a bit of dismay. This Star Wars is very problematic, but it has stuck with me so long, I could hardly care.

OVERALL,a good Star Wars movie with a decent plot, fairly good performances, brilliant score, really great effects, and many childhood memories, but the plot isn't very tangible, some performances can grow annoying, and the feeling the original gave is completely lost."
"Oct 01, 2012",0.5,"The duel scenes and visuals are very good, but all else is dreadfully poor. I hate to say it, but I find most of this film funnier than almost any comedy."
"Sep 29, 2012",2.5,"for a Star wars movie, writing poor relative to the actors involved in the Project."
"Sep 27, 2012",1.5,I didn`t like this at all..

"Sep 26, 2012",1.5,"There's just too many wooden performances and ""what are they thinking?"" moments to fully enjoy this film, but The Phantom Edit does neaten up the flow of it a bit."
"Sep 26, 2012",3.5,"The reason why you should never let one man have too much creative control. Good lightsaber fights, unneeded characters, good music, stupid plot ...  does not contribute anything useful to the overall plot. Watch for the Duel of the Fates at the end."
"Sep 25, 2012",1.5,"A huge letdown from start to finish and not a good way at all to start the prequel series. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace takes everything that was great about the Star Wars franchise and squanders it to the ground. This entry has poorly written dialogue, too many boring political conversations, lackluster acting and directing, a story that is not interesting, poor and dated cgi, and dull one-dimensional characters. George Lucas had everything here in place to make a really great movie, but he just couldn't write a good enough script and direct his actors well enough to do so. One part of this entry is all about seeing what Anakin Skywalker was going to be like and seeing him start his journey to becoming a jedi and another part is having to sit through a bunch a political squabble behind a droid invasion on the planet of Naboo and seeing Queen Amidala being told to sign a paper and stand down. These scenes drag the movie down immensely because they are just really poorly acted and nothing of real interest was ever happening.  Even the part of seeing Anakin Skywalker for the first time should have been interesting but it wasn't. I can really see why nobody has heard much about Jake Lloyd after this movie came because it pretty much has killed any chance of him becoming a star in Hollywood because he was just truly awful here. Out of all the child actors that could have played Anakin Skywalker much better and George Lucas decides to pick him? Really? He is just a kid who you end up feeling nothing for and his line delivery is laughable at best. The people that should have been great here was the rest of the cast but they weren't at all. Liam Neeson and Ewen McGregor should have been great together but they just end up delivering most their dialogue like a 10 year old being asked to read a passage from a book to a class. Which is exactly like how most of the actors in this movie deliver their lines. At times they sound like droids when talking. The cgi in the film is too overbearing it numbs your brain. In the past it may have looked decent. but now it looks extremely dated. Besides a few great cgi landscape shots, there is just too much of a reliance on it here and there really should have been more practical effects utilized. Another thing that did not work at all was the character of Jar Jar Binks. This thing has to be one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in any movie ever and every time he talked I just wanted to see one of the Jedi cut his head off with a light saber. Ahmed Best's voice and unattractive cgi have made for such an unpleasant movie experience. He is just a character that spouts off silly dialogue, makes stupid jokes, and messes up all the time. In the end, this is my least favorite film in the Star Wars prequel trilogy and the only positives I can name in this disappointment of a movie is that the lightsaber fights are exciting and cool to watch and John Williams' score is always great to listen to here and he did all he could to try and elevate the film with his music."
"Sep 24, 2012",4,"Yeah yeah Jar Jar, but the dual at the end plus the introduction of Qui Gon. This isn't as bad as people say."

"Sep 19, 2012",2.5,"It has its moments that will be remembered in the Star Wars saga, but the Phantom Menace's thin characters, heavy exposition, and lack of excitement will be remembered more."
"Sep 19, 2012",3.5,"Its not AS terrible as everyone says it was. Sure, some parts are down right annoying, but the good far outweighs the bad. Its no Empire, but its good."
"Sep 18, 2012",2,"The law of diminished returns has never been more beautifully personified than with Episode I. This is a prim example of, ""If we make a seauel to a beloved trilogy, we'll still make the money."" They were right, it made tons of money. Unfortuantely, Lucas left the fans out when he made this film. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGreggor do the very best they can with the convoluted script, and at some parts of the film, it looks like they just wanted to stop. Then there is Jar-Jar Binks, the overly racist charicature. Nothing more needs to be said. Then there was Anakin, well, the actor who played him. I know that it is hard to find child actors, but there must have been someone better than that kid. My complaints aside, there are some fun parts. The underwater city was pretty cool, as was the water monster. The pod race was well done too. Lucas should have just left the series alone, because this one bad film left a stain on its legacy."
"Sep 18, 2012",2,"Definitely the worst of the saga. In fact, he only saved because it is Star Wars (that`s why i gave him the two stars). Because if it were not so, would be a film completely ignored. I watched today on BluRay and it got worse. The digital effects are quite dated, easily getting worse than Pixar and Dreamworks animations. The performances are sufferable. The impression it gives is that the actors were not willing to act. In fact, it seems that only the film begins after the racing Pods. Prior to that, is an endless runaround. Now, the film has some strengths that deserve that emerged: The soundtrack of John Williams with his ""Duel of the Fates"" is fantastic. One of the best of the series. The villain Darth Maul is also very cool. Other than that, I think there's nothing else good. Anyway, honestly, I would prefer that this film had not been made."
"Sep 18, 2012",1.5,"There are impressive moments in the technical department like the race or some of the action sequences that are very neatly delivered, but The Phantom Menace is just a showcase of eye-dazzlying images with no real ground. With a very weak treatment on both Skywalker and Obi-Wan the only character that has a fulfilling development is the one portrayed by Liam Neeson. George Lucas struggles in achieving a compelling story mostly due to the very vague way on which the material is boarded, and also because the source material is just not that moving in the first place."
"Sep 18, 2012",3,"This is a movie I will defend until the day I die. Dont get me wrong the movie does have flaws like the awkward pacing, and I know some people say that it never lived up to the hype. But I'm here to tell you that this movie could have never lived up to the impossibly high expectations. Some may say that the characters are boring, I wouldn't say all of them. To be honest the only characters that are somewhat likable are Obi wan and Qui Gon.
Im one of the very few people that actually didnt mind Jake Lloyd as Anakin. All I saw was just a kid being a kid (you cant expect him to be giving signs that he will become darth vader in this early stage in the saga)
I will admit that I didnt mind the whole midichlorian talk either. People need to understand that Lucas changed the Mythology of the force because the original idea was controversial among christian religion.
Although there is one thing I cannot stand about this movie, and thats the talk of Anakins virgin birth. If thats not stupid I dont know what is!
Again I still think that this movie is far overlooked."
"Sep 17, 2012",2,"Those that were there from the start here is your long awaited prequel to the man they call Darth Vader...excited?  Heck Ya!  Im all in on this movie!  Yep, and thats what Lucas knew as well.  Lets shelve what made Star Wars great, and put out a big pile of stinky turd, because He knew all of us would be all-in.  There is nothing about this movie that is enjoyable.  Special-Effects, by the end of this movie, you will be able to take a class, because that is Episode 1, a big pile of stinky FX.  Jar Jar Binks is annoying and I wanted Maul who comes nowhere near as intimidating as Vader to cut him up and feed him to the Nerf's.  Anakin the young Vader is also annoying, which leads you to believe that he could have been bullied at school...by nerds.  His mother is...well...never mind...when(if) you see it...keep in mind there is never just one...Lucas shined up this turd for us, and we all took a healthy bite...Here is to the next one, I hope it will be better, cause it surely cant get any worse"

Did not hold up well with age.  Some good action scenes, but some really bad slow plotting, dialogue and acting.

My Review: 5/10
Date: 5/15/2005
The movie sounds and looks great with nice action scenes. It's too bad everything else is not so good - minor details like dialogue, plotting, acting.

My Review: 6/10
Date: 10/19/2001
This was the first time I had seen this movie since I saw it in the theaters. It's definitely a flawed movie, but still enjoyable. Let's start with the good: 1) There's a bunch of cool scenes with good special effects, especially the pod race and the light saber duels. 2) There are a lot of good actors: Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Samuel L. Jackson, and Yoda. 3) It's Star Wars fer cryin out loud! On to the bad: 1) The plot didn't move along very well, and some of the twists were a little out there: Midichlorians??? Trade franchises - what is this McDonald's in space? 2) The actual dialogue was very stilted and seemed forced (I'm sure point 1 helped contribute to this). 3) Jake Lloyd is not a very good actor, and all his ""Yippee!""s get very annoying really quick. 4) And last, but definitely not least, Jar Jar Binks!!! Hopefully Episode II will live up to expectations better than this one (even with it's B-Movie title, Attack of the Clones)."
"Sep 15, 2012",1,The Phantom Menace may not be the best of the saga but it's enjoyable for what it is.
"Sep 15, 2012",0.5,One of the most awful expirences of all time their is no way that is can be star wars it isnt right but their was a tiny bit of fun in the end
"Sep 13, 2012",2,"The 2 stars are for the pod race and the duel of the fates, both of which make great demo scenes in my home cinema. The rest of the movie sucked big ole sweaty ass!"
"Sep 12, 2012",0.5,"This is NOT a star wars film.. 
jar jar binks, Anakin Skywalker, yoda looks like a gremlin with a heroin addiction I could go on but I won't so let's just say I finally find the ewoks loveable but only in comparison."
"Sep 10, 2012",3,The special effects and the action is awesome. The story and the acting is bad. Even Liam Neeson couldn't save this movie. Overall it was the fan in me that gave it such a high score. Probably doesn't deserve it.
"Sep 10, 2012",1,"All other problems aside, it's remarkably boring."
"Sep 10, 2012",3.5,This is an outstanding start to the Star Wars series.
"Sep 09, 2012",4,"22 years after Episode IV (A New Hope), the second Star Wars trilogy goes back in time and focus on young Anakin Skywalker and his metamorphosis into Darth Vader, the dark angel who along with his first son (Luke Skywalker) capture the screen on the first opus. A narrative arch around Good and Evil, the ultimate theme to this saga, and Lucas' coup de grÃ¢ce: taking up the timeless moral values from mythical works such as Lord of the Rings, Homer's Odyssey, or even The Bible, to build a Universe of characters, species, planets and dialects. That's what fascinates us: the Galaxy of things, that expands before our very eyes!
So what's innovative in Phantom Menace? Only at a technological level. The bombardment of special effects congests nearly every frame with pictograms of multiple moving layers. Never achieving the visual elegance of A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back, this movie opts for a stratagem of graphical fireworks that ultimately turn it into a CGI technician's playground. Symptomatic of that is one of the film's best sequences, the podracers competition (clear reference to Ben-Hur's chariots), very much marked by the esthetics of videogames. The cast, very strong indeed, grants it respect and soberness, but it lacks the opportunity to shine. However, this doesn't preclude the elementary priciple of the project: to tell a story we all wanted to hear. George Lucas, like no other, knows exactly how to orchestrate that capital of desire and curiosity."
"Sep 09, 2012",0.5,Three words: missa no likey!
"Sep 09, 2012",3,It did the legacy justice
"Sep 09, 2012",0.5,Fuck this movie. Never again.
"Sep 08, 2012",3,"Overall, I liked it. Watched it with the boys. I thought the comedy parts were pretty lame, and that race seemed like it took 20 minutes. But the Star Wars-y parts were good enough to hold my attention."
"Sep 08, 2012",2.5,"This movie is a total mess, but it has some good aspects."
"Sep 07, 2012",3,It's Star Wars! Even if it sucks
"Sep 07, 2012",1,"Y'know who the Phantom Menace is? George Lucas as he hides behind his excuse that ""Fans just don't get it"". A boringly shot, boringly acted, and boringly written movie that fails to make the audience connect with even one of the characters."
"Sep 06, 2012",3.5,"This was the first Star Wars movie I remember seeing, and I remember liking it at the time. It wasn't until later that I was able to compare it to the original trilogy. It may be relatively lighthearted, and may have a little too much comic relief and padding, but the story as a whole is still interesting."
"Sep 05, 2012",3.5,"Despite all of its oft-mentioned flaws I still liked it, fuck it."
"Sep 05, 2012",3,"Myself and my wife watched this movie again last night on blu ray.  We hadn't seen it since our first viewing back in 1999.  OK, it's Star Wars so that helps a bit having been awed by the original trilogy.  However, I didn't even remember that the acting in this movie was so atrocious.  In almost every line it was like the actors were simply reading off the script paper with almost no emotion involved.  Pathetically the only character, a computer generated character, that exhibited much emotion was the idiot Jar Jar!  Was the story that bad???  The story was extremely simple but in line with the Star Wars universe.  Lucas did redeem himself somewhat with his great special effects and they did fit in the story line fairly well rather than being effects for effects sake.  I rated it 3 overall as the quality and effects were excellent but it got knocked down 2 stars for the simple story line and pathetic acting overall."
"Sep 04, 2012",0.5,"the worst star wars movie it totally wrecked the legacy, but the rest of them are ok"
"Sep 04, 2012",3.5,"Worst of the series, but in no way is it a bad film."
"Sep 04, 2012",0.5,Really George??? ... Really?
"Sep 03, 2012",2,"This would've gotten at least four stars, but Jar Jar was horrendous!"
"Sep 03, 2012",2.5,"It was OK. It wasn't as bad as everyone said it was. It isn't atrocious like Project X, but it's not a masterpiece like the Original Trilogy."
"Sep 02, 2012",4,two words- DARTH MAUL!! Even though Obi-Wan whooped that ass!
"Sep 02, 2012",4.5,"I loved it as a kid as an adult I see the lack of character development and story. I hate JarJar, I love Darth Maul, I think Natalie Portman is hot, and Jake Lloyd is the worst child actor ever"
"Sep 02, 2012",3,"Not as fun as the original three, but neither is if as bad as many people make out.  It's worth adding that the final 'saber fight is probably the best in the whole franchise."
"Sep 01, 2012",3,Jar Jar Binks kinda ruined this movie for me. But the other characters saved it especially Darth Maul with his double Lightsaber now that's awesome.
"Sep 01, 2012",0.5,"Three words describe my feelings on this movie: This is shit. Everything about the film is laughably bad. Darth Maul is the only interesting character in this awful film. Do yourself a favor: skip this one. Although, it is fun to make fun of."
"Aug 31, 2012",5,Amazing it made me a star wars fan loved it
"Aug 31, 2012",0.5,"Star Wars: Episode I has become my generation's equivalent of Highlander 2: The Quickening - it's the epitome of a filmmaker betraying his fans, the base line for terrible filmmaking, and the butt of everyone's jokes. It has been taken apart, deconstructed, ripped to shreds and seethed over by countless disillusioned fanboys, to such an extent that reviewing it seems redundant. What can I say that the likes of Red Letter Media have not covered in far greater detail, and with much better jokes?

Being someone who never likes conforming to popular opinion for its own sake, I went into The Phantom Menace with as open a mind as it was possible to have. Sure, it might be bad - but surely not as bad as its reputation would lead us to believe? Even as someone with mixed feelings towards the Star Wars phenomenon, I wanted to be the one defending the film, at least in some small way. But despite my best efforts, I am forced to concede and state the obvious: The Phantom Menace is horrendous.

It is rare that you come across a film so utterly inept that you don't know where to begin in criticising it. I have neither the time nor the patience to list every last plot hole, or criticise every single creative choice (if the word 'creative' is remotely appropriate). Nor do I have such low standards that I intend this to become a splurge of incomprehensible ranting about how George Lucas is the devil (he's not, he's just delusional). So forgive me in advance if this review feels a little cluttered or disorganised - at least it'll make more sense than The Phantom Menace.

It probably makes sense to start with the ways in which Episode I betrays the original trilogy, and therefore the fans that made Lucas immensely rich. The whole reason that the prequels exist, other than money, is because fan enthusiasm for the originals was so sustained. Lucas had planned the trilogy several years before the Special Editions, in light of the success of the Dark Horse comics and Timothy Zahn's novelisations.

The difficulty is that The Phantom Menace doesn't know who its core audience is - indeed none of the prequels do. It doesn't know whether it wants to be a direct throwback to the originals, replicating the trilogy's aesthetic warts-and-all, or whether it wants to bring in a new, younger audience who have no familiarity with the first three films. Lucas never comes down on one side or the other, resulting in a film which is too complicated for anyone older than then, but too infantile and stupid for anyone over that age.

The plot of The Phantom Menace is simultaneously too convoluted and too asinine. The originals were classic, Flash Gordon-style stories of good vs. evil, which drew inspiration from the westerns, matinee idols and adventure comics of Lucas' youth. They explored ideas of freedom, justice and redemption through epic dialogue and action scenes on a grand scale. This is a film about taxation, votes of no confidence, and pod racing. At best, it's not engaging; at worst, it's cataclysmically dull.

Perhaps no aspect of The Phantom Menace has gained greater notoriety than the concept of midichlorians. Put simply, in a single conversation Lucas changes the Force from a spiritual power into a biological phenomenon, caused by something as ordinary as bacteria. The Force is no longer something which can be controlled and mastered by everyone, given enough time and training: it is something that you can only use if you are genetically built a certain way. Not only does the concept not make sense, but it turns the Force into something elitist and aristocratic. While the originals were populist, making us believe that anyone could master the Force and become a Jedi, Episode I teaches us that Jedi are born, not made, so you may as well not bother trying to be one, or indeed care about them.

Everything written up to this point has been from a fan perspective. But even to the casual viewer, who may be coming to Star Wars for the very first time, there are many problems with Episode I as a piece of filmmaking in general. It's not just that it's a terrible Star Wars film, or a terrible prequel - it's a terrible film, full stop.

Firstly, as Red Letter Media have pointed out, there is no central protagonist to whom we can relate. This stems from the fact that the whole of The Phantom Menace, and the other prequels, are essentially backstory to get us to the creation of Darth Vader and the birth of Luke and Leia Skywalker. Since this transition would only take up one film at most, Lucas has to keep us distracted for more than five hours, introducing characters whose only purpose is to get us to that point. They have no personality or development outside of that - they just exist as dull, poorly-written, obvious devices.

Qui-Gon Jinn's purpose is to be killed at the end so that Anakin can be trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi. There is nothing else that he does in the film that couldn't have been done by Obi-Wan himself. Darth Maul does nothing but follow the Jedi and fight them, since his only purpose is to provide a climactic action sequence - which of course, ends with a big anti-climax. Anakin, Obi-Wan and Amidala are all completely in situ: they're only there because they have to be in the next two films. As an aside, the body double sub-plot involving the latter and Keira Knightley doesn't work - because they look nothing alike. Why not just create a CG duplicate of Amidala, like you did with the droid army? 

This brings us onto Jar Jar Binks, a character who epitomises everything wrong with the film and the prequels in general. Not only is he poorly written, obnoxious and annoying, but he exists solely to appeal to very young viewers, patronising them with every word he says. That's not to mention the racial stereotyping of the characters, whose Jamaican-style dreadlocks and accent are partnered to a personality which is lazy, clumsy and cowardly. And Jar Jar is not the only blatant stereotype on show: the Viceroy, head of the Trade Federation, speaks with an oriental accent a la Fu Manchu.

The performances in The Phantom Menace are universally terrible. Liam Neeson spends the whole film speaking in monotone and looking into middle distance, like he really doesn't want to be there. Jake Lloyd is pretty poor as the young Anakin, though he's mildly less annoying here than in Jingle All The Way. Ewan McGregor does a half-decent Alec Guinness impression but it's all on one level, and Natalie Portman looks mopey and confused. Not even Brian Blessed and Terence Stamp can save this film: even if the latter started shouting ""Kneel before Zod!"", it wouldn't help.

If nothing else was true about the original trilogy, the action sequences were always exciting and engaging. But here not even the mindless action is remotely entertaining. Lucas has become so reliant on CGI that the battles have no physicality, and the lightsaber fights are so highly choreographed that there is no surprise or spontaneity. The editing is repetitive, Lucas' camerawork is lazy and his staging of every scene is broadly the same, with character either sitting and talking, or walking and talking.

There is no better example of a pointless action sequence than the pod race. Like so much of the prequel trilogy, it feels like we're watching someone playing a computer game - or that the film is essentially a long advert for said computer game. We sit there watching pods overtaking each other at random, enduring random explosions and changes in the course, until convention takes over and Anakin wins. In many ways, it sums up the film, being a long, tedious distraction with no narrative purpose, designed only to milk money from people who are mostly too young to know better.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace is a cataclysmic alliance of boredom and betrayal that will break the spirits of any Star Wars fan and put newcomers off the series for life. Every aspect of the film that you could possibly mention has something wrong with it, and all the pieces are barely held together by Lucas' horrible direction and lazy editing. It's a soulless and depressing experience, which leaves us not just reeling from its own awfulness, but from the knowledge that there are two more films to go before we get to the good stuff. Still, at least things can't get any worse - right?"
"Aug 31, 2012",4,Not bad for the first prequel to Star Wars. I love Queen Amidala's dresses and the music.
"Aug 31, 2012",0.5,"Awful   , Jar Jar Binks need I say more"
"Aug 30, 2012",4,BRILLIANT AND A VERY SENSIBLE START FOR THE PREQUEL
"Aug 29, 2012",2.5,Japanese Title: Suta wozu episodo 1 - Fantomu menasu
"Aug 29, 2012",1.5,The phantom menace is George Lucas's excuse to have CGI in Star wars without  putting it in the originals and to have boring scenes of endless politics.
"Aug 29, 2012",2.5,"Childish and sometimes laughable, The Phantom Menace is a lazy film driven by George Lucas who fails to deliver descent acting and a descent script. I'm surprise none of the actors deliver a worthwhile scene."
"Aug 29, 2012",2.5,Darth Maul vs. Jinn and Kenobi gave this two stars and the only memorable scene in the movie.
"Aug 28, 2012",2.5,A disappointing start to the franchise.
"Aug 28, 2012",3.5,Not perfect but love it nevertheless
"Aug 27, 2012",2.5,"Only just recently, after rewatching this, have I realized how utterly horrid the acting is in this. Even Natalie Portman isn't worth a shit in this and that's saying something! Ewan McGregor saves this piece of junk and Jake Lloyd is surprisingly good in his only big film role. Liam is only decent at best, as he phones in his performance either for the sake of a big payday or as a favor of some sort? The worst of the series, but to be able to tell the whole story properly it had to be boring. But it didn't have to totally suck like it does."
"Aug 27, 2012",3,An epic disappointment to everyone but a guilty pleasure of mine
"Aug 26, 2012",4.5,"I love the Star Wars Episodes, I watch them with my hubby!"
"Aug 26, 2012",3.5,Got me all excited for 2 and 3 to come out.
"Aug 25, 2012",2,The Pod-race and the Darth Maul fight are the only things worth watching in this film.
"Aug 25, 2012",2,This movie didn't add anything to the series. They should have left it as a trilogy in my opinion. :(
"Aug 23, 2012",3,actually this one is pretty boring and is well childish
"Aug 23, 2012",3,second worst star wars film next to attack of clones. there are many characters that no one care about. like podracers and other jedi characters besides obi wan kenobi and yoda. i didn't like child anakin skywalker.
"Aug 22, 2012",2,"When i first saw this as a kid, i loved it so much i saw it a second time in theaters. I really didn't understand what was going on, but keep in mind i had never seen anything like this and didn't know the original trilogy at the time. As iv'e grown up now and became interested in the original trilogy, i realized how crappy the CGI in this movie was and how badly it dropped a steaming turd on the original trilogy. Not to mention all the boring and annoying senseless parts. The best part of this movie was the brilliant new villain ""Darth Maul"" with his double light saber during the dual with that amazing music. I don't consider this movie part of the true story. There's so much i could talk about but i'll leave it at that."
"Aug 21, 2012",4,Well written and amazing effects
"Aug 21, 2012",2,"The first out of the prequels is almost a poor start. It doesn't touch the questions or story of the original trilogy, such as the development of Anakin Skywalker. Some characters feel weak, however, the character of Darth Maul has become quite an icon. While it does feature some nice visuals and some stunning lightsaber duels, this maybe the weakest out of the Star Wars saga, but it might be worth a try."
"Aug 21, 2012",2.5,"It has loads of energy and funs at moments, but not enough to justify the 130 minute running time. Almost every scene with young Anakin is boring."
"Aug 21, 2012",3.5,the only thing i can remember is Darth Maul
"Aug 21, 2012",3,somethin' is missin'...but i am a star wars' fan...so...what?
"Aug 20, 2012",1.5,"Oh, George Lucas, why? After waiting for 16 years, fans get Episode 1...Oh how it makes me want to cry. Let's start with the good: Liam Neeson is always awesome, Darth Maul was pretty epic and the lightsaber fight was pretty freakin' cool. Now for the bad: Jar Jar Binks is completely pointless to the story and he was made purely for merchandise. The pod race, otherwise known as How to Make a Video Game off of a Star Wars movie. The race is too freakin' long, and it was created to make video games. Jake Lloyd as young Anakin...no explanation required. All in all, half the scenes and the characters in this movie were unneccasary and it was a terrible start to a B level trilogy. Grade: F"

"Aug 19, 2012",3.5,Three and a half out of Five
"Aug 19, 2012",3,Saber duel earns a star.
"Aug 17, 2012",3,"Prequel (or history) of the famous movie series ""Star Wars"" was simply doomed to success. George Lucas did not appear on set as a director of more than twenty years, just built a strategy and tactics of their new ""star of attack"" on the population of the Earth. First, he made a careful reconnaissance expedition, releasing in 1997 again, with a few cosmetic changes and computer, the very first series of ""Star Wars,"" which, as we all know, is the ""Episode IVÂ». Unthinkable for the expected re-release hype and the other two parts (""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi""), issued in rolling, so to speak, for the company. With this commercial, and most importantly - the viewer's boom not only longtime fans of ""Star Wars"", but also a new generation who have not seen the previous series in theaters or not had time to read them on video (yes, it turns out, there were even some uniques) Lucas could prespokoynenko regarding the success of your future business to begin, at last, for the shooting of ""Star Wars Episode IÂ».

And the situation so well that he even put off nonsense, she would still have programmed caused heightened public curiosity. And if before the release of ""Phantom Menace"" and ""Phantom Menace,"" as in the original (by the way, would anyone really explained why it was called?), Director-writer-producer in one person chose to move away from the box office prediction , already received them in excess of $ 400 million, was able to convince all that about it and counted, not hoping to win the ""Titanic"", but being absolutely certain: the budget is $ 115 million certainly pay off. Ironically, even those critics who are sweet things about this film, George Lucas, former devoid of fascination, and above all - a unique feeling of opening unknown universe, not questioned (in contrast to the cases of attacks on Steven Spielberg) Calculate and speculative approach of the author "" Star Wars ""in the psychology of the crowd, which is being pre-treated, will accept any message from his new-found prophet.

Pick on something, mostly to the problem of subject-drama (as if they were not in the previous series!) To mellow songs (especially loose, if not sharper - it seems dull and overcast the entire first half of the picture until the racing scenes) . Sometimes unconvincing characteristics of the characters, especially the men (and a different, as in the animated film Walt Disney Studios, and obtained interesting pozabavnee). Of the performers, perhaps, can be identified only by August Pernilla as a mother of Anakin Skywalker, the original Madonna of the future - is not it her solid Scandinavian school of acting.

Two really exciting episode, introducing viewers to a state of active unrest, including - at the level of physical reactions like shivering when impatient (this is referred to the race - the alien equivalent of ancient chariot competitions - and even a powerful final battle), did not produce is really mind blowing experience for its special effects and Supernova are for Lucas largely samopovtornymi. As they say, so what! Even a special sound (Dolby Surround Ex) does not seems to be something crucial in perception. And even more - he and two thousand modern effects used in ""Episode IÂ», can not be revolutionary just the latest breakthrough towards the cinema, which was the release in May 1977, a low cost (only $ 13 million) and removed as at random to ""Episode IVÂ».

Everyone believed at the time that will be released some rubbish - and the fees for the first 6 days were only $ 2.6 million But enormously unwound ""The Phantom Menace"" in the first six hours of the night show (!) Had $ 7.5 million See the difference! More and more crucial for success is not the product of an artistic level, and the power of advertising campaigns, and to some extent the compelling campaign audiences to the cinema, and it is desirable in the first days of hire, if the quality of the goods offered will worsen next week. That is, these ""Star Wars"" have not only fast acting effect, but also perishable qualities. So-called ""sturgeon second freshness"", but that the sturgeon!

And in actual fact, it is hard to escape the feeling that George Lucas as a repetition or a poorly written essay (""the topic was not disclosed"" - as we wrote in the margins of notebooks teacher) had to sit down again for textbooks, preparing for re-examination, to rewrite re your text, explaining: where did the robots and Ar2Di2 Si3PiOu, as born father of Luke Skywalker and why it then fell under the power of the Dark Forces, what I did in my youth, his teacher, Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi? Not surprisingly, new issues appear more than give the answer to the old ...

However, reviewing the need for about a month ""hidden threat"", I not without surprise the second time, not only with genuine interest the action of the familiar, but much better appreciated ""hidden philosophy"" message George Lucas world population, especially - those who live in the XXI century. Basically, all the commentators pay close attention to the religious and mythological allusions's ""Star Wars"" - from ancient and biblical teachings to the modern ""new ageism"". Although very interesting motif appears and again disappearing ""phantom menace"" (perhaps this is how should be translated subtitle Phantom Menace), which it claims is literally from the first sentence uttered in the film the young Obi-Wan Kenobi. Also worthy of special analysis the theme of ""dual duality"", which is represented in the good (Queen Amidala and her maid allegedly) and evil (the boy Anakin ever become Darth Vader, but also the mysterious ruler of evil, as it were split in two, releasing the arena Darth Maul) options.

And then you can only assume that this will be more clearly developed in the two series, which is to be expressed more precisely the mechanism of transformation of the individual and in full force at all its opposite. While in ""Episode IÂ» has already been given a hint that the destructive changes occur in the case where someone is afraid of fear itself, fear of materialization ""phantom menace"" that is hidden, perhaps in all - and not all are willing to overcome this initial set of evil. But the eternal antinomy of Christ and the Antichrist, as recorded in the harmony of their names - not that it is the manifestation of the duality of all things and the shape-shifting, where good and evil fight indefinitely."

The character development is absolutely flat, and there is way too much going on to create a decent plot.  In the middle of it all, we get an overly-long go-kart race.  Seeing Darth Vader's roots as an annoying little kid serve little purpose and deters from the mythology of the character.  George Lucas' insistence on everything being connected through coincidence (e.g. Darth Vader just happened to build C-3PO) also contributes to the ruination of the highly anticipated prequel.

Yes well, with the release of Star Wars was a blockbuster because with the years of the first trilogy was increased over the audience.

"Aug 11, 2012",3,"Within the annals of Star Wars lore, or just movie history in general, the business of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is something of a sore subject.  Here, in one sitting, is the single most anticipated movie in the history of the medium (try to think of one bigger) and the most distressing to a generation that grew up with the hip-cool of George Lucas' original trilogy. They had waited 17 years for its creator to loop around to tell us the story of the rise and fall of one of the most memorable villains in movie history, and the results, for many, did not meet factory standards.

A decade after its initial release it may seem difficult to focus on the film more than on the public's reaction to it, but that really depends on your point of view. Back in 1999, the film didn't meet the overreaching expectations of a cynical audience, most of which were too young to even remember the elation of first seeing the first three films in a theater. For them (not me) their disappointment over The Phantom Menace made it trendy to make fun of Star Wars. Yet, your enjoyment of the new rerelease may depend greatly on where you stand with this series. What are you willing to forgive? Are you willing to drop your cynical hatred of Lucas' infamous meddling and see the film with fresh eyes? It is strictly up to you.

Revisiting the film again as it rolls out into theaters in a new 3D format (the other films are scheduled to be released in 3D, one per year for the next five years), I am finally able to take a step back and review it from a distance without the anticipation or the negative feedback clouding my judgment.  I maintain the same opinion now that I had 13 years ago: This is a glorious science fiction fantasy, a visionary work that embellishes the kinds of ideals that science fiction were created for.  The colors are bright and vibrant, the visuals are breathtaking and the actions scenes, especially the three-way lightsaber dual at the film's climax, still seem fresh. The craftsmanship is top drawer. The rest leaves something to be desired.

Where the movie works is in the technology. That's George Lucas' trademark.  The best quality of the Star Wars pictures has always been in displaying new worlds to explore and new sights to see.  It is clear that Lucas was light-years ahead of everyone else in terms of what went up on screen and I defy you to find one single frame of this movie that isn't crafted - technically - with loving care. The locations are wonders to behold, especially landscapes like the Italian-style vistas of Naboo, the desolate rocky terrain of Tatooine and the glowing underwater pods of Gunga City. They show Lucas' flair for imagining alien worlds that play as a lovely travelogue of places that only exist in the imagination. 

Plus, as with all of the Star Wars pictures, there is a wonderful display of Lucas' love of action scenes.  All of Lucas' films from THX 1138 to American Graffiti to Star Wars to the Indiana Jones pictures and the recent Red Tails, contain at least one breathtaking vehicular chase. There is no denying that the pod race sequence, a death-defying race through the rocky terrain of Tatooine is thrilling. The advancement of those scenes, which now employ the innovation of computer generated imagary are far gone from the Death Star trench-run on the original. Plus, there's something new in the advancement of the hand-to-hand combat. The lightsaber duals of the original film were based on classic swordplay. Here they seem based more on martial arts. Watch that lightsaber dual at the end again and you'll see what I am talking about.

Where the movie falters is in the characters, and that's something that no amount of technology can improve upon.  What made the original trilogy work was that we cared about the plight of our heroes.  They were well-defined within an action-packed setting.  Here, I still find the human characters to be a bit thin. We forgive young Obi-Wan Kenobi, young Anakin Skywalker, Senator Palpatine and R2D2 and C3PO only because we know that they are characters who will flower over the course of the series.  But new additions like Qui-Gon Jinn, Padme Amidala and Shmi Skywalker seem oddly empty as characters. Their personalities seemed dusted upon them lightly like dew.  They are mired in a plot that doesn't have time for them to flower as complex human beings. Most disappointing is the relationship between Anakin and his mother, which you might expect to have a little more weight. When a gamble over the podrace leaves Anakin free and his mother a slave, she is forced to let him go. Yet there's something empty about her reaction - her son is leaving her! The scene in which the two depart feels like little more than a student leaving his elementary school teacher at the end of the term.

Yet, while most of the human character seem thin, the one that surprised me this time around was Anakin. As played by Jake Lloyd, there is far more complexity to him than I had notice before. He, of course, is the lynchpin of this entire saga, a kid whose soul will be corrupted, plunging him down in to the depths of darkness before redeeming himself with the help of his son. Here we see him as a sweet-faced little kid, a boy who is industrious, and inwardly anxious for a better life. His young eyes burn with ambition and there are moments when we can see fleeting glances of the frustration that will someday consume him.

The supporting characters that really work are Lucas' gallery of computer-generated aliens. As with his original triology, he packed the frame with 10 or 20 different kinds of creatures at the same time so the world seems to exist beyond just the central plot - we sense that the background characters each have a story to tell. The aliens in this film, for the most part, have dimensions. My favorite is the gravel-voiced Watto, a greedy creatures who looks like a strange cross between an aardvark and hummingbird. There's Sebulba, a champion podracer with the face of a Great Dane who walks on his hands. There's Boss Nass, a bulbous Gungan who flaps his jowls to finalize an agreement.

Of course, I must also address the elephant in the room. I cannot discuss the film without touching on the film's chief blunder (and the chief reason that the film is a sore subject), the presence of Jar Jar Binks, surely the single most hated creation in film history.  Seeing the film again, I realize that time hasn't improved him.  I maintain now what I have said all along: a little of him goes a long way and Lucas' chief mistake was allowing him so much screen time that he seems to take over the picture.  Lucas, it appears, responded to the gnashing of fans over Jar Jar because his presence in the rest of this trilogy was limited - he got two scenes in Episode II and a fleeting cameo in Episode III. Also owing ot the fact that Lucas knows he's made a mistake is the fact that Jar Jar has been completely left out of this rerelease's ad campaign.

Even with that, the experience of seeing The Phantom Menace again was a chance to see it again with fresh eyes. I went in with an open mind, and an open heart. I find it to be a very good film, but not a great one. For everything that works here, I could find something else that doesn't. The film is a mixed bag of successes and missteps. As for the 3D transfer, I cannot complain. Lucasfilm has always been at the cutting edge of new technology and I was happy that the movie wasn't over-saturated with 3D effects. The movie is in 3D but you don't really notice it until the moments when the movie really calls for it. Most especially well-done is that podrace. It is always a treat to have any Star Wars picture - even this one - back on the big screen. I could have done just as well without the 3D process, but I appreciate the effort. Seeing the film again makes me anxious to get reacquainted with the series on the big screen over the next couple of years. I have a good feeling about this."

"Aug 05, 2012",1.5,"Thoroughly disappointing.  With the occasional exception of Ewen McGregor, not one likable character graces this film."
"Aug 05, 2012",0.5,"Bad writing, bad acting, stale direction, just an excuse for George Lucas to use his new computer animation technology for. I wonder if any thought was put into it at all. I have a soft spot for it because it was a major staple in my childhood."
"Aug 05, 2012",1.5,"This is not Star Wars! Full of boring ""Star Wars"" politics, choreographed lightsaber fights, Jar Jar Binks, awful characters and a story that has so many plot holes and a pod race. It's meant for kids obviously with characters like Jar Jar Binks and the main character being the kid (To be honest, I dont even know who the actual main character is) but why would they make it so complex for them to understand? George Lucas took a giant shit on his own franchise with this one."
"Aug 04, 2012",1,1 out of 5 poorly aging directors.
"Aug 04, 2012",4,"The restart of the Star Wars series.  Though not as good at the original three, the CGI has come such a long way that it is worth watching.  And Darth Maul is one of the coolest villains ever."
"Aug 03, 2012",4.5,"Even with Jar-Jar, it's great."
"Aug 03, 2012",2.5,Probably one of the biggest disappointments in movie history. In terms of annoying characters this movie has two which completely kill the presence of wonderful actors like Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor.  The story is also garbage and not that fun to watch. The fight seen at the end of the movie is the one highlight that is memorable from a star wars movie that many of us wish was never made.
"Aug 03, 2012",4.5,"It would have been great if they did the Avitar. It could have been special now if they get it right Before they get to A New Hope, it would be great to fly down the Death Star with Luke!"
"Aug 03, 2012",3.5,"Above average score solely on the innovative and excellently presented visuals, this terribly written prequel was a dissappointment to the entire Star Wars fanbase. Redeemed only -just- by an exceptionally well choreographed saber fight for a finale, this badly written film features the worst dialogue in movie history.... and midicloreans. What in the world were you thinking, George Lucas?"
"Aug 03, 2012",2.5,2 and a half stars for Darth Maul.
"Aug 02, 2012",2.5,"Filled with boring political propaganda that was not present in the original trilogy, not to mention the sickening presence of Jar-Jar Binks combined Jake Lloyd's performance, the only good to be taken away from the most disappointing comeback to a franchise is the demonic Darth Maul who has only minutes of screen time."
"Aug 02, 2012",5,"I'm definitely in the minority on the recent Star Wars trilogy. As much as people can complain about the movie suffering from a weak plot and sub-par acting, as a Star Wars fan, I actually have a lot of love for this excellent prelude to the classic trilogy. I generally prefer the original trilogy over the prequels but I still love the latter three. The acting in this film is generally competent with Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid doing stand out work. Jake Lloyd, who usually gets a lot of flack for his performance as Anakin Skywalker, is wooden in certain scenes but he does a good job in many of the more dramatic scenes of the film. The visuals are tremendous with Lucas clearly upping the ante in the effects department. The story is the weakest of the six episodes and the film has many goofy moments which is why I think it is weaker than the other films. Jar Jar Binks is often the main source of hatred toward the film. I'd be lying if I said I liked him particularly, but he does not destroy the film and it is easy to get through it without being bothered by him. The political talk in the film is also very interesting and allows the viewer to see how Palpatine rose to power. The final lightsaber duel at the end is incredible and thrilling and Darth Maul simply kicks ass. Despite my love for the film, however, my only big problem with it is that the main character of the film, Qui-Gon does not reappear in the following films with Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme, the supporting players earning the title of protagonist in the next ones. Therefore, this film is kind of filler though it still delivers the goods. If you go and watch it with an open mind, you may find something to appreciate and ignore the narrow-minded and opinionated comments by butt-hurt fans."
"Jul 31, 2012",3.5,Liam Neeson made this movie!!!
"Jul 30, 2012",2.5,Ehhhh it was okay...better visuals then the originals

"Jul 28, 2012",1.5,"The only thing you ever will get out of this film is an annoying ass racist CGI retard, a bad kid actor, crappy 3-D and special effects that were amazing in 2000.

Don't watch this movie....."
"Jul 28, 2012",1,"Lucas attempts to reignite the Star Wars franchise with a new spectacle driven story. Once you get over the pretty CGI, you're left with a clunky and emotionless story for the uninitiated"
"Jul 28, 2012",0.5,"Truly awful connived merchandising exercise that wastes some good acting talent and adds nothing to the originals  

Unless you are under five avoid at all possible costs, you have been warned."
"Jul 27, 2012",0.5,"My friends stood in line for half a day to see this when it first came out. We were all excited to finally see what George Lucas had made after many years. Never have I ever been so disappointed with a movie. Jar Jar Binks?! What the hell were you thinking!!! It wasn't just bad , it was horrible. Lucas you outta be ashamed of yourself and I want my money back!!!!"
"Jul 27, 2012",4,"Lucas provides a visually stunning back-story to the origins of Anakin Skywalker in Episode I. With brand-new modern-age technology (undiscovered in 1977) Lucas is able to present his vision of 'Star Wars' the way he intended. Though the execution may have fallen flat, the visual world of 'Star Wars' is given a completely different makeover with the CGI-improvement in this film. 4/5"
"Jul 25, 2012",5,a lot of people i know hated but i didn't it was beautiful
"Jul 25, 2012",4.5,"It's Star Wars, so I must love it on principle.  That said, it is clearly the weakest of the Saga."
"Jul 25, 2012",3,"It's okay, at best. Despite better effects and graphics, they do not make up for shoddy acting (although certainly no fault of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman) and a less interesting story."
"Jul 24, 2012",2.5,"While it has some impressive effects and fight scenes, The Phantom Menace suffers from the plot, characters, and script."
"Jul 24, 2012",3.5,I feel some potential for this trilogy.
"Jul 24, 2012",3.5,Darth Maul is the most underrated part of this movie.
"Jul 23, 2012",2,"Normally I write a synopsis but with this film I have no idea what was the ultimate plot due to the oversaturating amount of subplots. 
Reviewing the prequel trilogy is a demanding task as one could easily rant about its problems and story inconsistencies (which is what most people do) and because a lot has been said about them, so there is almost nothing you can add (a perfect example of a review that says every problem this trilogy has is Red Letter Media´s Mr Plinkett), but I will be fair and mention the good and the bad. On the good side the first instalment has undeniably impressive fighting choreography, the action sequences are a fest to the eyes, the new designs feel connected to the Star Wars universe, some ideas (like the Ben Hur homage) are somewhat clever, it takes advantage of technology and provides an impressive expansion of the universe, Ewan McGregor is the perfect choice for a young Obi Wan, ""Duel of Fates"" is among the finest compositions that Williams has ever made but the rest of the score is bland for a Star Wars film, it is the only prequel that has an actual production design and cinematography, instead of overloaded green screen; and the CGI is impressive for its time and it pushed the limits of new filmmaking (for better or worse). Now let's address the negative side: The dialog is just awful, the story is nonexistent and lacks focus, the characters are forgettable (even the bizarrely beloved Dart Maul as he doesn't do anything other than flips and taking out a cool lightsaber, even the also inactive Boba Fett had more going on), there are numerous inconsistencies with the original trilogy, it gave audiences the most annoying, useless, ridiculous and stupid character of all time and the one that's the focus of almost every scene; severe pacing issues that go from extremely rushed resolutions to endless sequences, painfully obvious ""twists"", an unnecessary addition of politics that goes nowhere, Lucas directing is as amateurish as in ""Star Wars"" (thus explaining the dreadful acting), painful to watch ""comedy"", the decision of making Anakin a child is one of the dumbest ideas Lucas has ever had (an that's saying a lot), a script that is filled with plot holes, and finally Lucas just destroys the spiritual essence of the saga in such an insulting way (I honestly can't think of a better word to express that decision) by trying to give a more scientific angle to a space fantasy! 
""The Phantom Menace"" is undeniably the biggest disappointment in cinematic history. It is poorly written, directed and executed; but it also shows that Lucas doesn't care about his creation or the fans that made him the successful businessman he is now. It is undeniably a bad film but not the abomination many claim it is, but please don't say it is a good film just because of the cool looking villain, because it has the name Star Wars or the showoffy action."
"Jul 23, 2012",4,Enjoyed it! Liked all the Star Wars Movies!
"Jul 23, 2012",3.5,"Not as fun as you would hope it would be, but still has some decent fight scenes and a memorable racing sequence. Characters a bit undeveloped."
"Jul 22, 2012",3.5,Darth maul fight only good part of the movie
"Jul 22, 2012",2,"""The Phantom Menace"" (the beginning of the Star Wars saga, chronologically) is more or less a disappointment to Star Wars fans due to the kiddie overtone of the film &amp; the hammy acting by characters Jar-Jar Binks &amp; Anakin Skywalker, both whom I find annoying. Kids will like it, teens &amp; adults not as much."
"Jul 22, 2012",2.5,You know you've got a problem when Jar Jar Binks has more character development than Obi Wan
"Jul 22, 2012",2,"Bright and flashy, but slow and boring at times. A few inconsistent plot holes, but, hey, it's got some cool action sequences."
"Jul 21, 2012",3.5,This entry in the 'Star Wars' franchise doesn't deserve the amount of hate it gets from fans.  Is it lazier than the other films? Yes.  Is it more silly? Yes.  Is Jar Jar face-palm inducing? Yes.  Are the meta-chlorines in Skywalker's blood a rip off of the idea of thetans from Scientology? Yes.  Is it a terrible film that George Lucas should spend the rest of his life apologizing for? No.
"Jul 21, 2012",1.5,"With the new Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens trailer just released, I thought it appropriate to review the prequels. In many ways I will always have respect for George Lucas. He was a pioneer of cinema for a time, working with great writers and directors including Lawrence Kasdan, and Steven Spielberg. However, I will never forgive the changes made to the original trilogy. After the major critical success of the originals and after the major fan base was established, Lucas wanted to revisit his beloved world amongst the stars. So, he went back in time to tell the story of Anakin Skywalker and how he transformed from Jedi to Sith lord. Did that tale need to be told? No, but it was exciting to return to this universe in a galaxy far, far away. ""The Phantom Menace'' was born. And it nearly broke the heart of every true Star Wars fan. It stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and others not worth mentioning.

Episode one takes place years before the original trilogy. The Trade Federation lead by the frog heads are preparing for war. Behind the curtain (not really), is the evil Emperor. His new apprentice Darth Maul, who is the menace I think, is sent to track down some Jedi. Obi-wan Kenobi (McGregor) and his master Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson), are escorting Queen Amadala to her home planet when they are shipwrecked on a beloved, yet desolate planet called Tatooine. Seeking help, they come across young Anakin Skywalker. He and his mother are slaves to a flying tusk creature. He agrees to help them win a pod racing contest to help them earn the money to buy a new engine. Anakin leaves his mother to go away and become a Jedi, even though he ""doesn't want things to change.''

First of all, this is a very disappointing film. It is a mildly entertaining film, but it is not a good movie. At all. Many people nowadays say this about the prequel trilogy. If you like these films that is perfectly okay. You still are a Star Wars fan just like me. I personally hate these films, but I will be pointing out the pros as well as the cons. For me, Star Wars was an a thrilling experience. The character of Luke Skywalker, a misfit farm boy become Jedi was amazing. The story lines, characters, humor, action and spectacle, and everything about the originals were perfect. They were uplifting and had a sense of magic to them, and they still do. These films are, for the most part, some of the most lifeless, effects driven, humorless, and boring scifi films made in the 20th century, despite the somewhat entertaining action sequences.

So before we get into the really ugly stuff, let's acknowledge the positives. There are several moments in the film that make me feel like I'm watching a Star Wars movie. Obviously, there are lightsabers and fights, but it's in the very subtle moments. The shots of Tatooine, the space battle, the brief mentions of the mythology of the Force. The fight scene at the end of the film, involving Maul and our two Jedi, is one if the best lightsaber duels in the saga. It stands proudly and just secondly to the duels with Vader in the originals. It is a well choreographed fight from beginning to end. The cinematography is quite impressive at times, and I love the score by John Williams.

Now for the negatives. Remember the humor in IV-IV? It was subtle. C3-PO kicked R2-D2 and called him a useless piece of junk. The Jawa's yelled, ""ootini!''. The scenes with back and forth between Han Solo and Chewbacca. These were truly comedic and memorable moments. This film created a new character, almost completely ignoring R2 and 3-PO, and rather the comedic relief came from Jar Jar Binks the Gungan. While there are some who actually can stand this nonsensical annoying as heck creature, he is mostly universally hated by Star Wars fans. Binks adds nothing to the film but further annoyance to the already painfully awful film. The characters are shallow and not believable whatsoever. The dialogue is clunky, and the CGI effects are most of the time terrible! The amazing effects of the originals put these to shame.

""The Phantom Menace'' is an unworthy film to be considered a part of the Star Wars Saga. While some parts and mildly entertaining, the rest of the film falls almost flat on its face. The dialogue is rubbish, the acting is flat, the GCI is like an old computer game, the ""comedy'' is not funny at all, and it lacks almost everything the originals established. No magic, no charm, and just flat out boring. Not even the fight at the end can save the thing from getting two stars from me. Boy, am I excited for J.J. Abrams new film. May the Force be with you! It's just not with this movie.Â "
"Jul 21, 2012",2.5,"Although it was not as good as it could have been, it catches your attention enough to watch Episode II, which is what it is intended to do."

"Jul 20, 2012",4,"While boasting masterful special effects and a gripping story, poor performances drag down The Phantom Menace."
"Jul 20, 2012",3,"Not the best of the saga, but it will be easily remembered as the movie that asked, ""why is Jar Jar there?"". For the average individual they'll never get the story straight."
"Jul 18, 2012",3,"I'm a Star Wars fan and this is the worst one in the series. This beginning could have been much better after 16 years from ""Return of the Jedi"". The most character I hated was ""Jar Jar"" which I don't know if it was supposed to be funny, Episode II is one step better by showing this character only once."
"Jul 18, 2012",0.5,Rubbish. Atrociously bad.
"Jul 17, 2012",3,"This movie lacks focus in my opinion. I like it, but mainly because its a Star Wars movie. Neeson and McGregor carry it. Everyone else just seemed to be there. It needed more plot and character development."
"Jul 17, 2012",3,Darth Maul's the best thing about the movie
"Jul 17, 2012",2.5,"The 4th Adventure in a galaxy far far away doesn't have a good or even unique plot with pot holes and confusing and pointless moments. The film's visuals are the true star of the film, as for the acting Liam Nesson is the heart and soul of the film with his careful and brilliant performance. As for future Oscar Winner Natille Portman, her performance is stiff and awful no emotion and no soul to her character. The film is okay  - but nothing compared to the original trilogy."
"Jul 17, 2012",3,"Hugely frustrating first part of the prequel trilogy, which just about manages to be watchable thanks to an excellent (but underused) villain in Darth Maul and a handful of spectacular action scenes."

"Jul 15, 2012",3,"Interesting for the visuals, yet doesn't draw you in emotionally with its poor plot. Williams, on the other hand, rises to the ocation and creates a sweeping score to be placed amongst his best."

"Jul 13, 2012",2,"A lack lusture plot, a less than engaging villain, this movie misses out on the grand epic scale star wars has always been on. As it is a relatively mundane, iscolated war. The characters are boring, annoying (ugh jar jar binks) and one dimensional and  there is no underlying moral message. The pod racers were a high point in this movie to miss."

"Jul 12, 2012",3.5,"While the conflict between the Trade Federation and Naboo is a bit muddy, Episode I is primarily an origins films; in this it is effective and fairly compelling.  Die-hards should appreciate watching the future Vader along with favorite mechanical buddies C3PO and R2D2 be pulled out of obscurity, as well as tracking the development of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and Prince Amidala, both of who will play major roles in ensuring that the dark side does not overwhelm this galaxy far, far away.  As humans are wont to do, we will probably always attach ourselves more closely to Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo of the originals--and perhaps they did have a bit more personality to offer than our young Obi-Wan and Amidala--but there is still a lot of fun and intrigue to be had in the first episode.  The least of the Star Wars movies was still exciting stuff in '99, and holds up well in 2012."

I can quote most of the original trilogy, (which are the best three), I have been a long-time fan of ""Star Wars Insider,"" and I built a Millennium Falcon in my basement when I was growing up.  But I really did like Episode 1, and the 3D version was something I couldn't pass up.   While 3D movies are far too expensive, this was worth going to just to see Star Wars in theaters again. The 3D wasn't spectacular throughout, but it was great during the fight scenes.  And of course, the best scenes are the dueling ones.  I loved this!"

"Jul 07, 2012",5,"Qui gon jinn and Darth Maul are soo badass, its a shame they die here. When I first saw episode 1 I had hope for what follows, it felt freah at the time and I thought it will only get better as we go (besides jar jar binks). But the sequels werent as good sadly but either way I love a the star wars movies."
"Jul 07, 2012",3.5,"The movie gets far too much hate for the good things it does. There's an abundance of exposition and uninteresting characters, and the second act of the movie becomes too boring for its own good. However, a tremendous first and third act is what The Phantom Menace can easily be praised for, as well as John Williams' memorable score."
"Jul 07, 2012",1.5,What is this? I don't even..
"Jul 06, 2012",2,"Unfortunately, Lucas' return to the beloved franchise does not live up to the hype. With cheesy dialouge, uninspired characters and one of the most annoying aliens to ever hit the screen, Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace lives up to its reputation has signaling the downfall of the once great George Lucas"
"Jul 05, 2012",1,"Jar Jar lives, Qui Gon Jinn dies, nuff said."
"Jul 05, 2012",0.5,Midi-FREAKIN'-chlorians...
"Jul 05, 2012",3,There was so much anticipation for this movie that it was inevitable to disappoint to a certain level. It is difficult to create new characters that are so cool as those of the previous Star Wars movies.
"Jul 04, 2012",2.5,"Although good in parts it's still known as ""The film that ruined a generation's dreams, hopes and that spawned the greatest prequel trilogy disappointment of all time"""
"Jul 04, 2012",3.5,Kid anakin and jar jar...... BLEH! Enjoyed the rest of the film though
"Jul 03, 2012",4,"Let's call this: ""a childhood guilty plesure."" 
Case closed."
"Jul 03, 2012",4.5,I actually really enjoyed this for the most part. Was entertaining enough even if its not perfect.
"Jul 02, 2012",5,I loved this movie in 3d. I don't. understand why it is so disliked.
"Jul 01, 2012",4,"I think George Lucas made the right decision to start the Star Wars series with episode IV. This introductory chapter is not developed enough to attract many new converts to the saga; however, it is beautifully filmed and introduces a wave of new technology and special effects to the legendary series."
"Jul 01, 2012",4,"This film was destined to disappoint from the start. 16 years of anticipation (felt longer than that for diehard fans). Incredible marketing and hype surrounding it's release, it had to be better than Dances with Wolves &amp; Titanic combined, to be considered a succes. Take away all that and Jar Jar Binks and you have a good Star Wars film that fits in well with the others."
"Jul 01, 2012",3.5,"Though the prequels are considered not as good, I did find some great action sequences in this once. I can watch this again for those only. Liam Neeson was good as always, Portman has been good as well.. rest are ok.. The casting and characterization of Anakin Skywalker has been a big disappointment both as a kid and as a grown up.. the makers really messed up resulting in the trilogy never arriving to the standards set up by the originals. I would still recommend a one time watch for some really awesome special effects. Will put this higher than Return of the Jedi as well."
"Jun 30, 2012",4,Out of hte star wars this one is the most boring i think
"Jun 30, 2012",5,My second favorite Star Wars film.
"Jun 30, 2012",3,"It was cool to see a Star Wars movie when it first hit theaters, but this movie seemed to be all flash in the pants. A let's see what really cool computer graphics we can do and not really tell a good story."
"Jun 29, 2012",2.5,"A significant drop in charisma and complexity set by it's predecessors and the weakest of the series, but none the less Phantom Menace will please fans and sci-fi junkies alike."
"Jun 29, 2012",0.5,Complete shit.  No personality in any of the characters.  No main character (should be Obi Wan.)
"Jun 29, 2012",1,"Too many plotholes, too much bad acting, too many inconsistencies. It's the beginning of a bad series that tried to be a part of the Star Wars trilogy, but failed miserably.

While the special effects were great, I am one of those who adamently believes in the words of George Lucas back when he actually put his heart and soul into making his movies, that 'special effects are just a means to tell a story' and 'it's the story that matters most'. What happened to that genius?

In my opinion, tear these up, redo them properly, and get the guy who directed Empire Strikes Back to redo this entire trilogy."
"Jun 28, 2012",5,i really love the movie
"Jun 28, 2012",2.5,"Probably not as cringe-worthy as many people remember, but not nearly what the world expected.  Parts of the movie feel too dark which the CGI could use another pass.  The elder actors are just fine, though the youngest in the lot (Lloyd as Anakin) has no charm.  Two key ""surprises"" in the movie should be greeted with shrugs to any astute movie-goer.  TPM feels like obligatory set-up for Episodes II and III with a half-baked story."
"Jun 27, 2012",2.5,"The first of the prequels has a lot of stuff that just doesn't make sense. In a way, it's more serious but it has Jar Jar Binks to make it seem like it isn't. A lot of the story, like the battle with the Gungans and everything with Anakin, are just plain unnecessary. There are some good creativity with some of the creatures and some performances, like Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson, are really good. They could have done a whole lot better though."
"Jun 26, 2012",3,"I own this Blu-Ray in a six movie pack along with:
* Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones (2002)
* Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith (2005)
* Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)
* Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)

and on DVD in a three movie pack along with:
* Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones (2002)
* Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith (2005)

and i also own the two-disc DVD."
"Jun 25, 2012",3,"""its star wars."" is all I can say about it"
"Jun 25, 2012",3.5,"Before you dismiss this brief review, I hated the concept of Darth Vader as a kid when I was ten years old!! So going into the film, I was already skeptical about liking it. Afterwords I enjoyed it! Years later....I enjoy it to a point! Jar Jar Binks is useless, having Anakin an Eight Year old to grab the younger audience is unnecessary, and making the world more advanced than Episode IV threw me off. At least the fight scenes was fun, and frankly, I am not as heartbroken as the rest of these Star Wars fanatics. I don't understand the expectations the die hards were looking for and I doubt I ever will. Episode I by all means is nowhere near among the worst of all times, and I'm sticking by my opinion!"
"Jun 25, 2012",3,"The special effects are as terrific as ever, but its story and characters lack the charm and sophistication of the original films."
"Jun 25, 2012",1,The first of three completely unnecessary Star Wars prequels that do nothing but disappoint. The only thing that kept me interested was getting to look at the sexy heartthrob Liam Neeson.
"Jun 25, 2012",2,Almost as bad as episode 2. Almost...
"Jun 25, 2012",2,"By the time TPM was released, just about every SW fan could have written a better story for the prequels. A silly, incoherent mess this movie is."
"Jun 25, 2012",4,The fanboys can rage all they want but Ep. 1 was visually gripping and powerfully acted even if its not as good as the original trilogy.
"Jun 24, 2012",2,A mediocre film that lets down the technical achievements!
"Jun 24, 2012",2,"May not be as bad as its reputation claims it to be, but still a flawed movie."
"Jun 22, 2012",4.5,Its Star Wars.  Need I say more.
"Jun 22, 2012",1,"Awful. First in the awful trilogy that makes you wish you lived in some other timeline where George Lucas retires after Episode VI, thus, never partially ruining Star Wars."
"Jun 22, 2012",4.5,"I loved this film when I was a little kid, now as an adult i can tell why people hate it and think it sucks, but Lucas made this movie for the kids and he succeeded in doing so. This movie (and pretty much all the other ones) have an nostalgic feeling and I enjoy watching them. I think that my generation appreciates Star Wars much more because I grew up watching all of them as a kid. I love Star Wars and I thank George Lucas and all the other people at Lucasfilm for giving me such a epic childhood!!!"
"Jun 22, 2012",3.5,"A different Star Wars feature. This one takes its time to build up the foundation of the story. Some interesting characters, political commentary and Darth Maul!"
"Jun 22, 2012",2,"A painfully dull exercise in high gloss, kid friendly science fiction"
"Jun 21, 2012",3.5,Looks like 80% of the budget was spent on the pod-racing. Still an awesome star wars movie for a different generation.
"Jun 21, 2012",4.5,"I was in the right era to love this movie. 
And rediscovered it in 3D. 
THis movie may lack of a lot of things it's still freaking awesome!"
"Jun 21, 2012",3.5,"While not being the best film in the series it still manages to hold some of the half decent story line and tale of a young Anakin Skywalker, although one character needs to go ( I think we all know who)."
"Jun 20, 2012",4.5,The most highly anticipated movie of all time and there was no way I was going to let it disappoint.  The movies that fueled my imagination as a child were back and cooler than ever!
"Jun 20, 2012",2,"The least of all six films. 

When it first came out, I, like many other moviegoers, was so in love with ""Star Wars"" that it didn't occur to me until multiple viewings (especially on VHS) just how much better the original movies were. ""Episode I"" succeeds in scope, but it fails to connect emotionally with the viewer like the other films. 

Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor do what they can, and I did believe they were Jedi (dull ones, yes, but believable). I didn't believe in Jake Lloyd as Anakin or Natalie Portman as Padme/ Amidala. I hate Jar-Jar- he's got to be the single worst thing that ever happened to ""Star Wars"". By putting such characters into ""Star Wars"", we are robbed of the more human heroes from the original saga. There were ""normal"" qualities about Luke Skywalker and Han Solo that made you really care about the characters. Not so here- we don't have a single ""normal person"". That person should've been Anakin, but Lloyd's acting is so atrocious that it never happens. And how did they screw up the Yoda puppet so awfully?! 20 years of evolution in animatronics, and yet Lucas is beyond sloppy with Yoda here- he looks nothing like the original puppet. Thank god they CGI'd him in the next two, I couldn't have taken any more of this thing. 

Because of home runs in production design, visual effects, music, and sound, this is a worthwhile big screen experience. However its severe limitations in dialogue and story are all too obvious on the small screen. 

Nominated for 3 Oscars (Visual Effects, Sound, Sound Effects), all of which it lost to 1999's vastly superior ""The Matrix""."
"Jun 20, 2012",1.5,This movie is flat out horrible.  It was a great example of bad film making in almost every sense except special effect.  This movie and script should make an excellent case study for new filmmakers learning what not to do.
"Jun 20, 2012",4,"Great movie, started one of the best trilogies ever."
"Jun 20, 2012",2,Such a great cast. Such disappointment.
"Jun 20, 2012",1,Possibly the most unnecessary movie ever made.
"Jun 19, 2012",4.5,"The best starwars movie to my point of vue, thanks to the incredible battle against darth maul."
"Jun 19, 2012",5,Timeless science fiction.
"Jun 19, 2012",1.5,I don't really feel there is not any developed character that you may call main character.
"Jun 18, 2012",2.5,Whosa gonna killa Jar Jar?
"Jun 18, 2012",4,"a wonderful start to the new film. good intro to obi wan, anikin and yoda. loved every minute. supurb story and let me say, ewan mcgregor is the perfect obi wan."
"Jun 18, 2012",3,i finally understand why people found jar jar binks so annoying... and is it just me or are the neimoidians asian...
"Jun 17, 2012",4,"i gotta get this, fantasy"
"Jun 17, 2012",1.5,"Metachlorian is what allows Jedi Knights and Sith Lords to use the Force. Yes, the Force. Something that was previously explained as  ""...what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together"", not a genetic mutation. This alone shows you how much respect Lucas has for his audience."
"Jun 16, 2012",3.5,Really liked Ewan McGregor

Being a hardcore fan of Star Wars &amp; George Lucas, all I can say is Brilliant performances, Superb Story-line, Fantastic Graphics, Outstanding Script, Mind Boggling Environments &amp; Out of the World Characterization - It is truly a Movie worth keeping for the ages. Thank you George Lucas. 
Overall Rating - A perfect 10 out of 10.
PS - Only Regret Darth Maul had to die. He was too good!!!

"Jun 15, 2012",2,"I mean, it's fun. If you take out Jar Jar Binks, midichlorians, space taxes, Nute Gunray's prosthetic lips, decoy hijinks, Jake Lloyd, and any Yippee's! therein and put in a protagonist, meaningful and lasting villain, some good dialogue, some real stakes, and you know, a plot, then we've got a movie!"
"Jun 15, 2012",1,the 3 hour long pod race scene cant cancel out the coolness of darth maul.
"Jun 14, 2012",2.5,"Not a great start to the second trilogy of star wars... The movie had perhaps the greatest Star Wars Villian of all... Darth Maul. But it also had the worst star wars character ever created... Jar Jar Binks- who added a childish humor, and an annoying presence which didn't suit the movie at all. The whole accent thing with jar jar  was just pathetic. This movie was a huge letdown compared to the 3 star wars movies before it. Which is why i gave it a 2 and a half (Not Worth Watching- Unless your a huge fan of star wars) the storyline was Good and the acting was Alright, it also had some nice visuals."
"Jun 14, 2012",2.5,Darth Maul and the confrontation at the end are the only good parts of this movie. C
"Jun 14, 2012",2,"Excessive prequel to the classic Star Wars trilogy. Respectable in its own right yet too far removed from its source material, this film is forever burdened by the expectation that it would live up to its theatrical forefathers."
"Jun 13, 2012",4,"The Phantom Menace (not including Jar Jar and the rest of the annoying characters) is certainly a fun filled movie that I personally believe is underrated. Although it definitely is a downgrade from the original trilogy, Phantom Menace is full of fast action sequences and has that enchanting feel from A New Hope."
"Jun 13, 2012",2.5,"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace would have been good had Jar Jar Binks not have been a bonehead. I hate it in movies when a stupid character can save the day even when they are doing everything by accident. Had that not been present this would have been a great film. I still think it was good. I loved most of the characters, and George Lucas has really proven himself as a visual story teller."
"Jun 13, 2012",4.5,yeah im a geek i own it :)
"Jun 13, 2012",2,"The Pod Race was cool and fun to watch.  Darth Maul was an amazing villain who  needed more screen time.  Ewan McGreggor NAILED Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Liam Neeson was delightful as Qui-Gon Ginn.  But the force is not balanced in this film.  For every pro, you get two cons.  The ugly: Anakin.  One of the worst child actor performance I think I have ever seen in a movie.  The Tatooine light saber duel is a close up mess of confusion and makes no sense.  The gungans are completely unbearable.  The Trade Federation is just silly.  And worst of all, Jar Jar Binks.  Oh, man, does he just ruin every frame he is in.  Star Wars Episode One has some amazing moments.  But the bad easily outweigh the good, making this one boring, almost completely worthless movie.  Seriously, if you look at this movie as part of the story ark for 6 Star Wars films, well, there's almost no point to this film.  Or the second prequel.   The new Star Wars prequels SHOULD have stared off where Episode Three ended.   Story wise, it would have been more powerful.  More compelling.  More exciting.  Instead, we get the three prequels that are boring, lifeless, soulless and almost pointless.  Again, this movie has some fun moments, but overall, it's a huge letdown."
"Jun 13, 2012",5,From the DVDs NOW to digital. Finally somebody did it right.
"Jun 11, 2012",5,"I thought this was a great movie. I love all the Star Wars. Yes, it isn't as good as the originals but it still had a good stroy and I like it. It was pretty cool in 3D too."
"Jun 11, 2012",2.5,"People complain about Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd, but it is still the best of the prequels"
"Jun 10, 2012",3,"Enough has been said about this film so I'll keep it as simple as possible, it's not as good as the original Star Wars films. The characters range from good to bland to Jar Jar Binks. To enjoy this film it's best not to question the plot, if you do, you're in a world of hell. It's still Star Wars so there's still some joy to be found in it."
"Jun 10, 2012",5,I like these 3 the best!
"Jun 10, 2012",3.5,i waited a loooooooong time for this
"Jun 10, 2012",3.5,A underrated Star Wars film. Not as bad as some fan's say it is.  It still has good moments in the film.
"Jun 09, 2012",4,I admit I do not hate this film and I regret nothing.
"Jun 09, 2012",5,"Contrary to popular opinion, this is the best episode to me."
"Jun 08, 2012",2,Ewan McGregor is the only reason
"Jun 07, 2012",2.5,"Star Wars: Episode 1 is back and this time in 3-D!!! For those who haven't seen Episode 1 I wish I could sum up the plot line, but that's a little hard to do. But here's kind of a basic: Star Wars: Episode 1-The Phantom Menace follows two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor) who are trying to prevent the Trade Federation from taking control of the planet Naboo. While doing so, they are unsuccesful and in turn must set off on an unplanned adventure with the leader of Naboo, Queen Amidala (Portman) and her friends, where they meet a very special boy with a very high midi-chlorian count (something that lives in our cells) named, Anakin Skywalker (Lloyd). From this, events unfold in unforseen ways. Leading us to wonder, what might come of this boy and how will he effect the future!

I must start off by saying this was my *gulp* eighth time seeing this film in the theaters. My excuse is that when it was originally released I had just graduated the sixth grade, there were really no others movies I could see in the theaters alone. At that time, I remember there was, for some reason, a hard crack down on letting kids who weren't thirteen into PG-13 rated movies. So, we saw Star Wars, a lot. Besides that point, when I heard Lucas was re-releasing the film I was excited to go and see the film once again. Relive the magic that once captured me the first seven other times and also be able to experience it as an adult. Yet, seeing this as an adult probably wasn't the best of all plans. I still found a few things exciting: the pod race, the fights with Darth Maul and the overall visuals. What I didn't find to great was: the acting, the way it drags on, and the 3-D. 3-D is always a big bother for me. I really do not enjoy running off to the theaters and having to sit there with those wonderful glasses on through the whole film. Plus, not to mention the increase of price that comes along with it. I do always say that if the movie was filmed in 3-D, it's at least some what of a benefit, but when a film is converted, like Episode 1, it's more of a waste of time. Here, the screen was blurry on the sides and also nothing really needed to feel 3-D'ish. This took away from some of the adventure. I realize that this is the most childish of all the Star Wars films and I'm okay with that. I realize that the story is lacking like crazy and the characters are very one-dimensional. But when the film jumps from being exciting to boring, I find myself wanting to be somewhere else. I don't want to sound like I didn't enjoy the experience, because I did. This movie really does have a special place in my heart and I know that's because of the time when it came out. But for now, I can only see it as the movie it is now, in 3-D. I felt let down by that and mainly for that reason I had to lower my rating. See it or don't see, I can't really tell you on this one. But for me, Episode 1 has been a great memory of my life, ever since I first saw it and that's how I'm going to remember it, the way it was when I FIRST saw it."
"Jun 07, 2012",3,"Star Wars, it has to be perfect... Right? Wrong. Although it's not the worst movie I've seen... It is far from the best."
"Jun 07, 2012",2,"Thank you George Lucas for the worst installment in the star wars saga. This is so bad, I destroyed the DVD."
"Jun 07, 2012",3.5,"Honestly, the worst of the six movies. It's a good story in theory, but because of the huge time gap, between Episode I and Episode IV, its difficult to actually get into. The real meat of the Star Wars genre doesnt get introduced until Episode II. From there on out it gets better."
"Jun 06, 2012",2.5,Two and a half because it's star wars. This movie has terrible boring dialogue.
"Jun 04, 2012",5,"The Thrilling Plot of Episode One,even though its  with its small share of goofy mistakes, such as  the characters of Jar-Jar and Young Anakin, with Lucas's Careful direction, the Characters of Darth Maul and Qui-Gon, John Williams awesome score, and the best visual effects of it's time, The Phantom Menace still turns out to be a pretty damn good movie.

Any true Star Wars fan can appreciate ALL of the 6-film saga."
"Jun 04, 2012",4,"Why do so many people hate the star wars prequels? They are (for the most part) good movies! I think it is because they weren't exactly using the same formula as the original trilogy. When I think of A New Hope, I think of black space, stars, futuristic ships floating around in them, and futuristic hallways that are supposed to be in those ships.

But when I think of The Phantom Menace, I think of beautiful green pastures, politicians, pod racing, and way more with the light sabers.

They're different, and that is why people have a grudge on them and call them disappointments. But when you separate them from the original trilogy, they're really good!"
"Jun 04, 2012",2,"bit boring and disapointing, though as a kid, i did love this film :/ xx"
"Jun 04, 2012",2.5,It is the worst of the series and had no character development. The annoying jar jar binks ruins the film. Besides these flaws it has strong acting and smart action sequences
"Jun 03, 2012",3,"This was not a good way to start of the prequels for Star Wars.  The acting and concepts spits on the originals glory.  The villain Darth Maul could have been something awesome, but Lucas does not use him to his full potential.  He ends up being a character we barely know from beginning to end.   The only thing this film has going for it is that it has the Star Wars name, and it has a lightsaber battle unlike any in history."
"Jun 02, 2012",5,STAR WARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 02, 2012",4,"While many bash on this movie as immature or annoying, Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson dual-handedly(?) save this film from a completely train wreck. Adding drama, characters to actually care about, and believable performances, these two actually make me forget jar-jar binks was even in the movie."
"Jun 02, 2012",2,"Fucking shit, George Lucas.

You introduce an awesome character that only has one line of dialogue throughout the film in Darth Maul. You also introduce one of the most annoying characters in the history of movies (that can be perceived as borderline racist) and has waaaaay too much dialogue. The kid that plays Anakin is extremely wooden and stiff. The story and direction are both choppy. Not even the holy trinity of McGregor, Neeson, and Portman can save this from being a bore."
"Jun 01, 2012",3.5,not as good as it's counterparts
"Jun 01, 2012",3,"I think I have a soft spot for this one because it was the first Star Wars film I actually could experience seeing on the big screen, and all the excitement that came with it."
"Jun 01, 2012",5,"good, my brothers all time fav. movie"
"May 31, 2012",1.5,"Pretty weak film. has the plot of a 1980s video game, and not a good one. Mostly shallow acting thanks to Lucas' bad direction, though there were great actors cast. Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson seemed liek the only two who cared, despite having nothing to do."
"May 31, 2012",2,"George Lucas finally did it, he created his long-awaited ""kids movie.""  Complete with little kids saying, ""Yipee!"" and of course, Jar Jar Binks."
"May 30, 2012",3.5,A let down to star wars fans a like but still a great popcorn flick.
"May 30, 2012",2.5,"Though it does give you goosebumps and has some good scenes and overall great action, and a good performance from Ray Park,Liam Neeson, and Ewan McGregor, The Phantom Menace suffers from some AWFUL performance (natilie portman is the worst), aged CGI, and to much politics and overall feeling that it doesn't need to exist. but it is a fun watch, but still a bad film."
"May 30, 2012",2.5,"Jar jars an idiot, Anakins a brat, and yet I can not look away..."
"May 29, 2012",2.5,"A long time ago...well, it wasn't a long time ago really...in a galaxy...well, not so far away...the start of a sci-fi phenomenon was born. It all started in 1977 when the first Star Wars movie (better known as A New Hope, the fourth instalment in the series) was released in the cinemas. Soon after, in the early eighties, two more sequels were made, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and both of them were just as good as A New Hope. However, in 1999, the start of another Star Wars trilogy was added, all three of them being prequels to the originals only this time, none of the movies in this trilogy were impressive (with the exception of Revenge of the Sith). A Phantom Menace isn't only known for being the worst movie of the lot but it's also know for the appearance of one of the worst science-fiction characters in the history of fiction. The three words that would have any Jedi shaking in their boots for the sheer horror of being absolutely annoyed and irritated and the terror that you'll be driving home from the cinemas with a headache: Jar Jar Binks. The bad thing about this is that he's on the big screen. What's worse is that he can be seen in 3D!

So Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace is and isn't really a bad movie. Just like every other movie, it does have it's strengths and it's weaknesses but it is mostly weaknesses. Some parts of the movie were entertaining whilst other parts could have been used as a tranquiliser to send you to sleep but luckily enough, the pod races and the Jedi fights are examples of why you should watch this in the cinema. The story isn't that great and there are some moments where it's cheesy and you feel like walking out but if you're new to the whole saga and you're going to watch them all in the cinema when they get released, please don't judge all of the series by Episodes I, II and III because truly, IV, V and VI are a lot better and more original.

I must admit, in 1999 when first watching this, I did enjoy it more but then again, I only had memories of the pod races and the fights and they're the same things that I remember from the film after watching it again. Luckily enough, my brain has managed to actually block how horrible Jar Jar Binks was. Some of the fans hated this instalment and I can see why they do since the story's really stretched, the characters are lifeless and the acting is wooden but the action and some of the special effects in the movie make up for it. If you're looking for a great plot with engaging characters, look elsewhere but if you're looking for some cool action scenes with some memorable fights, particularly one with Darth Maul, go and see this and as I said earlier, if you're new to the franchise and this is your first viewing of a Star Wars movie, please don't judge the others by this one!"
"May 27, 2012",3,I thought it wsas adventrous!
"May 26, 2012",2.5,"Um, the fight scene was pretty cool..."
"May 26, 2012",2.5,Can't stand Jake Lloyd.
"May 25, 2012",2.5,"The kids was annoying, Jar Jar Binks was pointless. Is this film comedy or fantasy? Not even George Lucas knows that answer."
"May 25, 2012",4.5,"entertaining and more, this prelude to the originals does the series justice. and lets be honest with ourselves, Jar Jar Binks is annoying, but really isnt that bad. comeon people"
"May 25, 2012",0.5,"3D just plane sucks, who wants to see Darth Vader as an 8 year old child, and don't get me started on Jar Jar Binks."
"May 24, 2012",0.5,Depressing in every way.  Some cool action sequences can't save this one.
"May 24, 2012",4,"Few filmmakers have had their back up against the wall as badly as George Lucas. The pressure to follow-up his original ""Star Wars"" trilogy with films of equal value must have been overwhelming, so much so that the next chapter in the saga was bound to be maligned no matter what. And that it was, but the question remains. How unjustly was ""The Phantom Menace"" criticized?

It's not in the same league (or more precisely, universe) as its predecessors, that much is true. Many of the new characters just do not have the enduring appeal of the ones we know and love, and some are just downright annoying. And the two that I connected with the most, Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn and the delightfully malicious Darth Maul, are killed in their very first film. That seems like a huge mistake on the part of Lucas.

The story is crowded and much less compelling this time out, dealing with some mumbo-jumbo about a Trade Federation, but what the film does achieve is laying out the backstory to this classic franchise. The acting is wooden, as is a great deal of the dialogue, but the special effects are still cutting edge. Nobody in recent memory has welded CGI and other insurmountable special effects as seamlessly as Lucas does here. Nowhere in this picture is the jarring sensation that we are watching something that was generated by computers and not something real. That may be the film's greatest strength.

You definitely cannot please everyone, but the backlash against ""The Phantom Menace"" is mostly unfair. It had an impossible task laid out for it, and it does the best that it can with that."

"May 24, 2012",5,"This is the movie that got me into Star Wars as a kid. It's what launched my love affair with this series. As such, I hold fond memories of it and love it to all hell. Except for Jake Lloyd, sorry kid. You can't act."

Bringing back the main theme from the originals was awesome,the lightsabers scenes are good,great visuals and CGI especially for the time,the underwater city was so cool. only SW movie with action underwater. Naboo is one if not the most exotic place in the saga,Jar Jar was funny for the most part imo,returning Tatooine was cool,watching actors from the originals like the one that portrays the emperor was great too,the podracing was cool and exciting,Coruscant is a cool place,Yoda CGI is way better than the original in the movie,Darth Maul was awesome so is the whole battle, the battle of naboo with the starfighters was cool,the droids are awesome in design,watching qui gonn funeral for the first time was interesting i didnt knew people could be burned as tribute at the time,the ending scene is a nice tribue to episode IV."

Tal vez faltaron mejores dialogos de Darth Maul con el emperador, DM parece un mero matón sin mucha personalidad.

"May 18, 2012",3,"With the exception of some exceptional fight scenes - especially the final duel between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul - this is easily the worst entry in the Star Wars series and a great example of lackluster film making. The dialogue and story are a mess, and it boasts a couple of incredibly annoying characters like Jar Jar Binks. It's far from a horrible film, but for a Star Wars film, it's a major disappointment."
"May 16, 2012",5,"Movie of my childhood. The 4 climactic battles (Anakin in space with the space station, Padme and the Naboo guard against the viceroy in the royal palace, the gungans against the droids on the plains of Naboo, and the lightsaber duel between Obi Wan, Qui Gon and Darth Maul) will be one of my favorite cinematic pieces for as long as I live.

"May 13, 2012",2,"A typical listless, dull, loud 90s action film that is 'Star Wars' in name only."
"May 13, 2012",3,This movie has great visual effects but lacklustre characters that are difficult to warm up to. I loved the original first three films and this one just did not have the same magic or chemistry.

   This movie was so great! I am a big Star Wars fan and this movie was just great! It had the great Liam Neeson as Qui Gon Jin and Ewan Megregor as Obi Wan! The cast was amazing, no doubt about that! Awesome special effects and epic battle scenes!

"May 12, 2012",2.5,"The adorable Jake Lloyd,Liam Neeson and Ewan Mcgregor couldnt save this abominable money-whoring movie"
"May 12, 2012",3.5,"Unfairly maligned for the better part of two decades now, 'The Phantom Menace' gets more right than it does wrong as a sci-fi/fantasy adventure film. Typical of its genre, some of the characters and performances are not that great -- and Jar Jar Binks can only be enjoyed by five-year-olds, pretty much -- but the visual design and FX is outstanding, and some action sequences are truly awesome. Where creator George Lucas most stumbles in this first Star Wars prequel, is he fails to introduce a story or characters that can be as beloved as the original trilogy -- exception being Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi, who largely anchors all the prequel films, I feel -- but that's a pretty tall order. Perhaps worse, instead of aiming his film at adult fans who grew up with Star Wars, Lucas aims it at the target audience for Star Wars back in 1977 -- families. And fanboys have raged ever since. Prior to 'The Force Awakens', the climax in 'Phantom Menace' still features the best lightsaber duel in any of the Star Wars movies, so that ought to count for something."
"May 12, 2012",4,After too long a wait this was a fantastic addition to the SW family.

"May 07, 2012",0.5,LADIES AND GENTLEMAN AND THE WINNER OF THE WORST MOVIE IN HISTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"May 07, 2012",4,"Star Wars Episode I Needs Introduction because most people have not given this movie a chance. I can tell you that you should give this movie a chance because its actually very good. The plot is the begginning of Anakin Skywalker and his years of a Jedi. He is very young and is a kid and meet Obi Wan and Qui Gon Jin and is taken with them. The main problem with everyone with this movie hates is Jar Jar binks. I think he is actually funny. He does have some humor. Other scenes like the pod race are very much fun and most of this movie is fun also so check it out.

86/100 B+"
"May 07, 2012",5,"Not a lot of people know this, Keira Knightley played one of the decoys for Padme"
"May 07, 2012",2,2 stars ONLY because it's star wars....
"May 07, 2012",1,"I really hate everything about this movie. The story is stupid, the acting below par, characters are not likable, and the only good parts, Darth Maul and Qui-Gon are not enough to salvage this movie due to one reason. The story is horrible and poorly written. Nothing can save a movie from a weak story or poorly written script (see Green Lantern), and when you have both problems, you know you're really screwed. This movie is terrible. Period."
"May 06, 2012",1.5,"After many years without a Star Wars movie been released, this one made the fans a little bit disappointed. It had no romance, no humor, not too much action. This one misses a character like the one played by Harrison Ford in the last ones."
"May 06, 2012",3,"So this is the film Star Wars fans waited 16 years to see?  Sure they say hind sight is 20/20 but if we knew at the time what we know now would we have still been nearly as excited to see this film now as we were then?  The film is visually stunning and the action sequences (especially the final duel between the Jedi and the evil Darth Maul) are impressive but the story is where this film really falls short and its unfortunate because the previous trilogy's story is timeless.  Jar Jar Binks is also a helpless mess of a character that George Lucas created as an attempt to cater to his younger viewers as well as serve as the film's comic relief.  

Lucas might've gotten it right the first time with the original trilogy however lightning rarely strikes twice in Hollywood and  this film sadly fell more than a bit off the mark.  Fortunately, Episode II proved to be a stronger movie however it still suffered from issues with pacing and poor ""romantic"" dialogue between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman.  Episode III, arguably the best of the prequel trilogy managed to in my opinion iron out most of the previous film's problems except for the fact that the film relied almost entirely on visual effects which kind of ruined the suspension of disbelief often created by fantasy and sci-fi films.  The Force will always be with George Lucas but the critically panned prequels prove that effects don't make the movie, the actor's performances and good, believable scripts do.  The Force is microscopic bacteria in your bloodstream? No thanks.  I would much rather prescribe to the theory that its a ""mystical energy"" field any day over that."
"May 05, 2012",1.5,Ehhhhhh... I'd prefer to not go into depth.
"May 04, 2012",0.5,"Child acting. Need I say more? Okay. A movie aimed at children, but still maintains a lot of violence (someone being bisected) and an education of the galactic senate process (who thought that would be interesting to watch?). This movie is a camel movie, designed by a committee. Action for the boys, jar-jar and poop jokes for the little kids, perdy dresses for the girls, and it all adds up to something spastic and inconsistent. It tries to explain so much crap which was needless. Midichlorians are the force? Really? Remember when the force was a magical and mysterious force that created wonder for the viewer? Well now it's space organisms or some shit (And this is literally never mentioned again in the series, that's how badly George knew he fucked up). Who gives a shit about a prophecy of the balance of the force? Why is it never explained who created the prophecy, and when and why? How would someone bring balance to the force if it seems like things are peaceful anyways? Numerous plot holes and several clear lapses of judgement and morality of characters who are supposed to be wise. Who  is the trade federation and why are they actually invading Naboo? Honestly, think about it. Something to do with taxes, but when is it ever explained what Naboo has to do with that? The jedi master, Qui Gon, needs to take a group of people to the shady and dangerous city of Mos Eisley; so he takes the moron jar jar, and defenceless women, and a slow and non-combative droid? Yoda let the kid, who an entire council of people said they had a bad feeling about and are kind of experts of predicting things will happen, train with the Jedi because of a promise? I could go on. Acting is consistently shitty because no one knows what the fuck is going on. There's no clear protagonist, and if there is one, he can't be connected with. The entire movie was made for money, and well in that way George, ya did it."
"May 04, 2012",3.5,When it came into theatres I saw it three times in one day.
"May 04, 2012",1.5,Pour les scènes avec Dark Maul et la course de pods. Le personnage de Jar-Jar Binks est vraiment insupportable. Et la 3D n'apporte rien.
"May 03, 2012",4,"Let's see.  How many films up to this point had been re-released in 3D?  Well, there was 'The Lion King' and the first two 'Toy Story' movies, but nothing was really as exciting as hearing the George Lucas would be re-releasing his entire Star Wars saga in the extra dimension.  Even the thought of seeing Kate and Leo in their youthful, shipwreaking days in 3D isn't as appealing seeing space battles, lightsaber duels, and asteroid dodging in 3D.  Yes, purist fanboys are still mad at George Lucas for altering his original trilogy.  Twice.  However, there are hordes of Star Wars fans out there who Lucas was banking on the shell out higher ticket prices to see their childhood dreams come at them in 3D.  Starting at the beginning was a smart move too, as the original trilogy is the more revered, and said fanboys will just have to go see the prequel and anticipate how epic the original trilogy will be when it arrives in three years.  
When the Trade Federation blockades the Naboo system, two Jedi are dispatched from the Galactic Senate to help end it.  What Qui Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) don't realize is that this is more than just a trade dispute.  The Federation is in league with the Sith, who have eluded detection for hundreds of years.  After an assassination attempt the two Jedi make their way to the planet surface, where, with the help of an exiled Jar Jar Binks (Amhed Best), the make their way to the capital city, where they rescue Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) from her droid captors.  During their escape from the planet, the Queen's ship is damaged, forcing them to land in a nearby system for repairs.  It's here that they meet up with a young boy named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who offers to help them get the parts for their ship.  However, it comes at a great price.  The Queen must make her way to Coruscant to make an impassioned plea to the Senate to help end the blockade, but her people's freedom rests in the hands of young Anakin and his podracing skills.  Meanwhile, the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) has dispatched his apprentice, Darth Maul (Ray Park) to recapture the Queen and kill the Jedi.  
As far as characters go, Lucas took a step back about thirty years and examined the generation prior to Luke, Han, and Leia's.  The knock out: Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Not only does McGregor channel Sir Alec Guiness, but the backstory helps flesh out his character tremendously.  The mediocre: Queen Amidala.  Yes, a lot of her story is veiled and you have to wonder why a planet would elect a 14-year-old girl to serve as their ruler, but she pulls it off.  The worst: Jar Jar Binks.  A lot has been made about how annoying Jar Jar is, and there's some merit to the argument.  However, it's clear that Lucas's heart was in the right place with the character. He wanted comic relief, and he got it.  If only he hadn't integrated the Gungan so heavily into the story, he probably would have fared better.  However, it was probably the light-hearted approach that Lucas was going for, instead of making the whole prequel trilogy as dark as its final installment.  Now, as a set up to a trilogy which examines the path that Anakin takes, this film only marginally succeeds.  It's nice to see a very young Anakin and then ponder why he embraces the Dark Side, but this one is pretty squeaky clean, when you might expect someone as twisted as Darth Vader to have a much more sorted past.  However, Darth Maul serves as a fantastic fill in for the dark lord.  Arguably, a better villain, where the less-is-more approach to his background is perfectly fitting.    
When it comes to the look of the Star Wars universe over a quarter of a century since we first took that journey back ""a long, long time ago"", a lot has changed.  Obviously Lucas probably wishes that he could have told his original stories with today's technology, but he's only had to settle for minor improvements - which throws purists into a sputtering rage.   But the film looks great.  Annoying, though he may be, Jar Jar was kind of the precursor to Gollum, in that an actor played the role of a computer generated character right alongside the actual actors.  At the time, it was kind of mind-blowing.  Plus, climatic the space battle and lightsaber duel look great.  However, he podrace sequence is quite the show-stopper.  There hadn't really been an edge-of-your seat moment in the Star Wars series since the trench run in 'A New Hope', but this one certainly got you there.  (Add the 3D to any of these sequences, and you're sure to enjoy it more.)  While we're talking technical aspects, let's talk sound.  As if the effects weren't enough, Skywalker Sound has crafted some brilliant sound effects to go along with the delightful score from John Williams.
Though it ranks fourth of six in my list of Star Wars films (you might be surprised which one is fifth, but sixth is pretty obvious), it's still a pretty entertaining film.  Yes, some of the acting leaves some to be desired - what ever happened to Jake Lloyd anyways? - some of the characters wear out their welcome, and there's probably someone somewhere who will argue ad nauseum over continuity.  But as a whole, the flick works.  The space battle is everything you wanted to see on screen as a kid, with the podrace as window dressing.  I can't be the only person whose jaw dropped when I saw Darth Maul whip out his two-sided lightsaber to take on two Jedi, and finally seeing Coruscant on screen was awe inspiring.  Yes, Lucas is probably only re-releasing the films to tamper with them or merely to make more money - because he must not have enough - but judging by the packed theater at the midnight screening, he knows how to play fanboys like a fiddle."
"May 03, 2012",3,"I saw this in 3D. And it's worth noting that the only other star wars film I have seen is revenges of the Sith. So I went into this one not having seen the originals, it seems to garner a lot of hate and honestly after watching I'd say a lot of it is not justified. Jar jar Binks should not be in this film. At least his personality shouldn't be. A character is needed to bond the gap between our hero's and his race but his personality is unbearable. His comedy is directed towards kids and no one other than kids will find it funny. Anakin Skywalker is a great little character and his upbringing although cliched is actually acceptable. Could have been more original but it is what it is. The races were cool I must say and they do a good job of showing the other racers personality with very little screen time. The short quips that Anakin makes are awful and underwhelm the moments. Natalie Portmans character and her planets background and political aspects I really enjoy. Same with the slave country's society. Darth Maul is amazing. So badass. But honestly we know nothing about him, he is there as action fodder. Although I over look this as his action, music and look out balance it. Still Doesn't make it right though. Liam Neeson is great. Overall this film gets a lot of hate from the original star wars fans and coming from someone who hasn't seen them I think it's a good movie, def enjoyed most of it. Binks ruins a lot of the film ESP the war between his race and the droids, what the hell was that? I loved the concept and army's fighting but his comedy made it look a joke. The film gets a lot of hate by original star wars fans and I understand why and can agree with them for why they hate the prequels."
"May 03, 2012",1,There are no words to describe how disappointed this movie made me.  For an amazing analysis of why this movie is so bad please check out this site:   http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/star-wars/
"May 03, 2012",2.5,"From the first 15 minutes, viewers will be disappointed with the plotline that focuses on wooden characters and pseudo-politics that looks like a big political debate thrown in with some lightsabers and droids. The very idea to incorporate an annoying, pointless overgrown duck named Jar-Jar Binks obviously means George Lucas is too lazy and overpowered with modern special effects to create fun characters, and the best character (Darth Maul) saw limited screen time and was killed off in a very ugly fashion. See it only for the Jedi  battle at the end."
"May 03, 2012",5,i have this not yet seen in 3D
"May 03, 2012",2,A disappointment. Over stuffed and underdeveloped.
"May 02, 2012",2.5,"The fun podrace, thrilling climatic duel and overall visual achievements can only do so much for a film with stunted dialogue, an annoying secondary/comic relief character and a plot that although makes more sense in the expanded universe, fails to excite in just the film (opening with a tax dispute is not the most exciting plot point)."
"May 02, 2012",3.5,"As a movie alone, it's OK.
However, making comparisons against the other Star Wars films cannot be helped, and Phantom Menace doesn't stand up.

"Apr 30, 2012",0.5,"The film that single-handedly ruined everything, ""The Phantom Menace"" is not just a bad movie, it's a cinematic pariah; the Mark of Cain upon celluloid. With a screenplay rushed out on a Legal Pad in less than a week, a director who has no clue what he's doing, nor cares, CGI that kills all suspension of disbelief and fun, and a cast who rightly look half-asleep given what they have to work with, ""Episode I"" destroys the magic and joy of the original films, and leaves us all colder and more hollow for having experienced it."

The saving grace I find through this film is perhaps its pod-racing scenes. Thus, by following the footsteps of Qui-Gon, I obtained two-and-a-half stars from Watto for initially betting on the Darth Vader kid to win the race. :-) Whereas half a star I got is the result of its half quality in three dimensions. As for the other two STARS I have lost during the WAR against the vast Trade Federation's droid army (which is why it is called STAR WARS, I think) on Planet Naboo, I owe them to RedLetterMedia's Mister Harry S. Plinkett's review of the movie (http://youtu.be/FxKtZmQgxrI).

"Apr 26, 2012",2,"A very long and drawn out film with unnecessary non funny characters, mainly Jar Jar Binks. Very overhyped and not a fraction as good as the original trilogy."
"Apr 26, 2012",1.5,"When I first saw Star Wars Episode 1:The Phantom Menace my thoughts were ""Why is this happening"" and ""Huh"". This movie sucks so bad, it's a mess. First, lets talk about the positives... it wasn't THAT long. Yep, thats about it. The effects aren't that impressive, and to be honest, the look so fake to me. Some on the animations look so bad! Okay, I'm going to calm down. This film takes place decades before the events of the original Star Wars (Bear with me here), a corporation called the Trade Federation has blockaded the peaceful planet of Naboo(Stupid name right there)in protest to a tax on trade routes(?) Two jedi knights , Qui-Gon-Gin(Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor) are dispatched to resolve the situation before it gets out of control. If you think that sounds stupid, that's because it is. There are so many plotholes it makes you wonder if anyone proofread this shit, and the characters make so many stupid decisions. Now I'm going to answer to compliments that this film gets:
 #1.This film is for kids, not for adults 
If this piece of shit film is indeed for kids, what's the deal with all the lame ass political dialouge? I guarantee you, take a kid to see this movie, by the time the Coruscant scene pops up they will be asleep.
 #2.The action looks really cool 
The effects aren't really bad, but I've seen much better. And the action is incredibly boring due to the fact that the characters are so unlikeable that you don't care if they live or die. It adds nothing to the plot or characters.
 #3.Jar Jar Binks is not as racist as people think 
Now I'm going to talk about the number 1 reason that this movie sucks, the racial stereotype that is Jar Jar Binks. He is so damn annoying, and if I was black or from the south, I would be mad as hell. He talks in an accent that's a mockery of these two. This lothesome c*nt does not belong in a Star Wars film.
 
To sum this all up, Star Wars:Episode I-The Phantom Menace is one of the worst films I have seen in my life, and I've seen quite a few. This film is a fuck you to the fans of old school Star Wars, a fuck you to film critics, a fuck you to kids, and a fuck you to humanity in general from George Lucas. This film is an abomination that never happened, avoid it at all cost!"

"Apr 22, 2012",4,"It's not too bad of a prequal to one of the greatest trilogies of all time. The story line fit perfectly with the originals and casting choices were perfect. The fight scenes were great an the new characters introduced by Lucas were intriguing... except for Jar Jar Binks, who was a waste of screen time but understandable considering the loss of the comedic duo of C-3P0 and R2-D2 from the original trilogy."
"Apr 22, 2012",4,"As good as the original trilogy, with a lot more serious action. The story is actually interesting, unlike its two sequels. I really liked this movie."
"Apr 22, 2012",2.5,Darth Maul is really the only cool thing about it. 2.5/5
"Apr 22, 2012",5,i luv star wars! people might call me nerdy but they should see the series first!
"Apr 22, 2012",5,by far the best of star wars.
"Apr 21, 2012",3,Haters going to hate.
"Apr 21, 2012",1,"Ok but did not match StarWars and Jar Jar sucked, who thought of that character"
"Apr 21, 2012",2,"There is a very good reason why this film gets shat on so much and is often called one of the biggest cinematic disappointments of all time: It flat out sucks, and if anyone ever tells you otherwise than they are either a dumbass Star Wars fanboy or a stupid little kid. 
The story is basically the Jedi have to stop a trade corporation from doing something to a peaceful planet by some means that are never explained to us.Let me just come out and say it: The movie doesn't make any fucking sense. And the plot itself isn't exactly what you would call ""Interesting"" or ""Complex"" either. Like, why the fuck are we talking about trade routes in a Star 'Wars movie, who gives a shit? Like I understand that this has to lay the groundwork for the entire Star Wars saga, but that doesn't give it an excuse to be this boring. 
How is the acting? Not much better than the plot unfortunately. While Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor do good in their roles (With what they're given to work with), everyone else in the movie is AWFUL! Jake Lloyd is awful, Natalie Portman is hollow, shallow, and just boring to listen to, and Jar Jar is annoying as fuck. And speaking of Jar Jar: Why is he here? If you thought the Ewoks sucked... they still do, but Jar Jar is so much more annoying than those walking teddy bears ever were. He is clearly meant as comic relief, yet every joke he makes is the equivalent to a fart or piss joke. I don't find him racist, just annoying and by far one of the worst characters in cinematic history. 
However, I will say this about the movie: The action scenes are really cool (What few of them there are) and the film has really damn good visuals. Like, seriously I give massive props to the effects team, cause the film is pure eye candy. This was the Avatar before there was well... Avatar. And the action is crisp and easy to follow and honestly, really thrilling (With the exception of the podrace, which goes on way too long and is not all that interesting to watch). The duel at the end between Darth Maul and the two jedi is a true sight to behold.
 However, there is way too much going on at the end: You got the battle up in space, the battle between Dath Maul and the jedi, the queen attempting to infiltrate the palace, and the gungans fighting the droid army. The jedi duel should be in the movie, the infiltration should be in the movie, everything else should be cut out. And another problem with the end is they way they kill off Darth Maul, like it has no meaning cause we didn't even know who he fucking was! At least with Boba Fett in Return of The Jedi we knew who he was and what he wanted, so despite his embarrassing death he remained badass, Darth Maul on the other hand goes out in the stupidest way possible, and we have no clue who he was or what he truly wanted?! Did he want revenge? Money? Power? We never find out. 
So yeah, while the film has impressive visuals and battle scenes the movie itself, with all of its boring political talk, shoddy script, and overall boredom it is easy to classify this as the biggest cinematic disappointment ever, though Attack of The Clones was so much worse than this."
"Apr 20, 2012",1.5,This movie was never made.
"Apr 19, 2012",3.5,"pretty good. The podracer scenes on Tatooine were awesome (great video game too). Loved Liam as Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul of course."
"Apr 19, 2012",5,Sith always come in twos
"Apr 18, 2012",4,Best of the first three in the series.
"Apr 18, 2012",3.5,"There are a couple of weaknesses with the first prequel, but, it gets better towards the Podrace sequence and the lightsaber duel in the finale."
"Apr 17, 2012",1,"Too long. I remember it as being much better than when I re-watched the 3D version. There is something to be said for the action scenes and visual effects, but overall, it's just hard to watch."
"Apr 17, 2012",3.5,jARJAR alm ruin-Darth Maul and Obi One saved it
"Apr 17, 2012",4.5,Worth the wait.. Answered a bunch of questions.
"Apr 17, 2012",2,The worst of the series. You don't care about any of the characters nor what is happening. Like a long boring video game that only 11 year olds would care about.
"Apr 16, 2012",3.5,Great Stat Wars film!
"Apr 16, 2012",5,I HART JAR JAR BINKS
"Apr 16, 2012",4.5,"I started watching the original Star Wars trilogy when I was 3, and I loved it ever since. Several years later, when I was 9, I saw this film in theaters for the first time. To those who say that this film lacks the magic of the originals, I say this: when I was a child, Episode 1 captured my imagination and enthralled me as much as the originals ever did. I was amazed and captivated by the podraces, Darth Maul, those freakin-awesome Destroyer Droids, and even the Gungans. The plot of this film may not be as tight as some of the others in the series, but there is so much world and creativity packed into this film...so many new species and concepts are introduced in only 2 hours that it's impossible for me not to admire George Lucas' imagination. Bottom line: I feel like a kid when I watch this, just as much as I do with the original trilogy. And though I'm in the minority, I will defend this movie until the day I die."
"Apr 15, 2012",3,seriously george leave them alone the original trilogy ok i can see putting in the stuff u left out  but why 3D it just don't help it any if u wanna do something with movies maybe try fusing some of the stories of the expanded universe i mean these books are really good im on fate of the jedi  apocalypse right now and it is awesome
"Apr 15, 2012",4,not bad but they should have remembered that they over did what the org. had. But George is still and awesome writter
"Apr 15, 2012",1.5,"Who are the Sith? Why are the Jedi at war? Why does a republic have a queen? What's the trade confederation? What is going on? Where am I? 

These are, unfortunately, some of the most blinding questions that will never get answered."
"Apr 15, 2012",5,You took away Darth Maul and left us Jar Jar Stinks...why I atta..!
"Apr 14, 2012",4,Good but Star Trek is still better.
"Apr 14, 2012",2,The 3D effects were lacking. Not worth the extra cost.
"Apr 14, 2012",2.5,"If you like guys with tattoos... and nascar... and strange cgi aliens... and shiny swords... and you don't like things like characters, plot, and good acting.... you'll like this movie."
"Apr 14, 2012",0.5,"La prueba documentada de que Lucas fue un tio con un golpe de suerte y algunas buenas ideas, pero indiscutiblemente carente de talento y cuyo unico don es saber ganarse a las nuevas generaciones para que compren merchandising hasta que se mueran. Una de las mayores decepciones que he vivido en el cine. Que coÃ±o, la mayor."
"Apr 13, 2012",2.5,"I really wanted to love this movie, but in reality: it's okay."
"Apr 13, 2012",5,George Lucas knew what he was doing when he created the last episodes first
"Apr 13, 2012",2,A long wait for a disappointing movie.
"Apr 13, 2012",2,Was this a George lucas film or a Disney film?  I guess for the little kids this one was alright.
"Apr 13, 2012",0.5,WORST WASTE OF TIME!!! All CGI with NO story!!! SNORE!!!! Insult to the originals! George Lucas needs to stop the Star Wars!
"Apr 12, 2012",3,go back to where you came from jar-jar
"Apr 12, 2012",4,one of my fav star wars
"Apr 11, 2012",1.5,racing scene was nice
"Apr 11, 2012",3.5,I liked it better on DVD than in the theater.  Maybe having the subtitles made it easier to follow.
"Apr 11, 2012",4.5,AGAIN ANOTHER GOOD STAR WARS
"Apr 10, 2012",2,"Even though it looks good in 3D, it still can't hide the bad charactor development, boring dialoge, and mind-boggling story."
"Apr 10, 2012",3,i sw it when i was like 4 but i stayed up 4 it so it must be good!
"Apr 10, 2012",4,"It's not the best Star Wars film to date, but it does give a great start to the entire series (perhaps because it isn't that much of a hard act to follow)."
"Apr 09, 2012",4.5,"Double end light saber, watch those twirls there sith lord."
"Apr 09, 2012",0.5,This movie is a piece of shit.
"Apr 09, 2012",2.5,"Ugh. Not the best Star Wars movie by far, but pretty good as far as George Lucas goes. Jar Jar is funny."
"Apr 09, 2012",2.5,Has some cool lightsaber scenes and the podrace scene is fun but I like thinking it never happened. Because it didn't. NOTHING MAKES ANY SENSE!
"Apr 09, 2012",3.5,the originals are better...
"Apr 09, 2012",1.5,I don't like star wars
"Apr 08, 2012",2.5,"What kind of a title is ""phantom menace"" for a star wars movie? That aside, this was a bit dull, but i guess every epic story has to start somewhere"
"Apr 08, 2012",3,Dear god... what was Lucas thinking...? But I still can't help but wanting to watch it.
"Apr 08, 2012",5,my favorite of them all
"Apr 08, 2012",5,LOVE STARWARS ESSPECALLY #1 AHHHH!
"Apr 08, 2012",1,"Bad acting, Lucas killed the mysticality of the Force with midicholrians and of course Jar-Jar.  I'll take a 4 hour movie of  ewoks if I could have Jar-Jar completely erased."
"Apr 08, 2012",4,"Obviously, so good, to see the start of the series, the young Anakin, the pod race, naboo fighter, Darth Mole, etc etc...First Star War movie (in 3D) for Sasha! (a big fan at 6 years old!)"
"Apr 08, 2012",0.5,"I laughed, I cried, and then I had a seizure. I, HATE, this, movie."
"Apr 07, 2012",2.5,Liam Neeson saves it from total failure
"Apr 07, 2012",1.5,"too much of the plot makes no sense or is never explained, and the characters are static and boring."
"Apr 07, 2012",2.5,Not as good as the originals...
"Apr 07, 2012",1,I just have nothing to say. This movie let me down and also the series.
"Apr 07, 2012",4,"it was fun and enjoyable, and I can't see why people hate this movie so much."
"Apr 07, 2012",1,"I hate child actors, I hate annoying comedy relief, I hate racist stereotypes, I hate awful writing, I hate senate meetings. In short I hate this movie."
"Apr 07, 2012",4,"Episodes 4, 5 and 6 were better, but it adds a star for loyalty"
"Apr 07, 2012",5,"I met Ray Park ""Darth Maul"" from this movie!"
"Apr 06, 2012",4.5,"Great-Freaking Movie!!!! All the bells and whistles and plot and canny and intrigue and romantic allusions of the original film. Filled in the gaps, and kept you there.  The Kid, while not a Haley Joel Osmet or Shirley Temple, handled such a big assignment with an air of childish calm, which leant authenticity to his role. Natalie...well, who wouldnt fall for her. I feel a bit wierd talking about the child-woman like that, but she is gorgeous. Liam and Ewan a put there stamp on a classic. We already knew they were good actors, but good actors having fun in the roles they are playing makes for a great movie. They came through for us.  And the legend continues."
"Apr 06, 2012",3.5,"Not nearly as bad as many will have you believe, ""The Phantom Menace"" is a solid piece of entertainment, every bit as well-acted and written as ""A New Hope"" or ""Return of the Jedi."" Star Wars is nothing but spectacle folks, and this film provides it in spades."
"Apr 06, 2012",4,"although not a bad movie its just not the strongest of the star wars movies, i mean theres plenty of stuff to make this good like Anakin skywalker and darthe maul and Qui-gon ect but its not the strongest of the star wars saga and not my favorite and granted there is a good story in it and good characters but there are points in the movie that just slow the movie down too much like the polotics and some of the jedi action seems allittle boring (not darth maul thats awsome) so theres not much else to really say. athough not the strongest, it still holds up to become a star wars classic"
"Apr 06, 2012",3.5,"I don't care what anyone says, it wasn't that bad.  Plus Darth Maul's fight was the 2nd best in the whole series (yoda vs. Palpatine is 1st)"
"Apr 06, 2012",4,"Whyyyyyy is it that Qui-Gon Jinn had to die, i almost had a heart attack on that part and was hoping for him to somehow get up. I found the little skywalker so adorable and loved the racing scene. The most epic character in my opinion so far, the disasterous Jar Jar Binks, oh dear he was pretty funny."
"Apr 06, 2012",3.5,great movie why is everyone hating on it it's long but other movies are long and they don't have pod races and spaceships and lasers and well you know better then episode 2 a little better then episode 3 good movie all around but they could have shortened it or added more action in the boring scenes 4/5
"Apr 06, 2012",3,O.V.R 6. Would have been more but Jar Jar Binks and young Anakin were terrible
"Apr 06, 2012",2,"Lucas should have stuck to the original methods that made his classics (4,5,6) what they are/were. Jar Jar Binks drove me NUTS!!!"
"Apr 05, 2012",4,star wars fan but then again to long
"Apr 05, 2012",4,Loved Portman's hair in this one
"Apr 05, 2012",2,COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOl
"Apr 04, 2012",4,Has to be part of my life
"Apr 04, 2012",2,"I was thrilled like everyone else to see this, but it just didn't have the staying power or presence of it's former installments."

"Apr 04, 2012",4.5,me encanta Jar Jar Binx
"Apr 04, 2012",5,its Star Wars enough said
"Apr 03, 2012",3.5,Not the original three but glad they made 1-3 :-)
"Apr 03, 2012",4,It is a good movie. But not my fav!
"Apr 03, 2012",4,The first of the new series...Qui Gon's death was the saddest part of the movie. A younger Natalie here. How she has progressed...and of course we are introduced to the real Anakin Skywalker. An exciting beggining to the final of the Star Wars films.
"Apr 03, 2012",3,Was this a story that needed to be told?
"Apr 03, 2012",2,"It would have been better if Jar Jar was not in there and they cut the word ""Yippiee!!!""

Is this Phase two of the Ewoks???"
"Apr 03, 2012",5,This was a very good movie.  I recommend it to any and all.
"Apr 03, 2012",2,"The Phantom Menace is like Crash, anything good that may be in it is overshadowed by stupidity."
"Apr 03, 2012",2.5,"Good movie, could have been better."
"Apr 03, 2012",2.5,"Take notice that this review contains spoilers for all star wars films.

After many request I am finally am going to express my feelings towards the star wars films. To try to make this as simple as possible I am going to start with the first one from the view of the story. 

Before I begin reviewing this I would first like to comment on something that bothers me. The link you have to click to review this movie is the 3-D link.... Why cant there be two types of links one regarding the original and the other this reissue of the same movie NOW IN 3-D, because everything is cooler in 3-D....


Star Wars eps.1 is not the only movie to have this treatment some Disney films are having the same effect such as the lion king and beauty and the beast. 

On to the movie it's self, well if you were like me and had watched the originals from a very young age like I was watching the original trilogy since age 5 then out of the blue there was hype because there were going to be a prequel trilogy. I was young and foolish back then so as you would of guessed I bought in to it as well. I went out and bought the original video games for the super Nintendo... I beat one of them some of them were a tad bit to difficult for someone like me. 

Then the day came when the movie had come out, all of us nerds came out of the basement and off to the movie cinemas, as a side note I went to my favorite for this one to bad for me this theater shut down in 2005 due to a lack of revenue.

When there was so much hype for this movie people had a scale that they wanted it to meet and my opinion this point was a bit to high. Something that I can say that really put people in the right direction when looking at the trailer was it was still the same director of the first movie G.L. that inspired hope in to all of us fans.

Then after a week or so I went to go and see it. Now to be honest when I left I was so excited and pumped for the next one because I was young and foolish...

The movie for it's time looks visually great and the light saber fight with darth maul at the end might be my favorite for the prequels. The part of the movie is borderline epic.... but lets just get this out of the way so I can just let loose when considering this film. Jar Jar could be the worst idea in the last 30 years. He has the potential to destroy the world. SO FREAKING BAD! 

I don't know one person who likes him nor defends him. Just the biggest failure of a creation if I have ever seen it come out of the star wars movies. If you disregard him then this movie is much more tolerable. Then there is the man who would become darth Vader (parody). He is nothing to praise. He is ultra disturbing and the high pitched voice makes my ears bleed AND THEY GIVE HIM SO MUCH SCREEN TIME!Not to mention the most disturbing thing about him which is how he is so young is trying to go after a girl much older then him (they have a baby by the third movie) that is cringe worthy so I shall do such.........


The movie as a whole is not that bad but this the worst thing to say that it is the best amongst the prequels. Liam Neson is gone by the end of the movie he is here and there well he is everywhere because of the koolest villain is the star wars prequels DARTH MAUL! That dude is epic. Duel light sabers does not talk much at all, just a quite killer who gets the job done I like him. 

For the final point one of the biggest high lights of the film. The race, it is ok for the time the effects were pretty epic but feels unnecessary for the movie. When you think of star wars what do you think of? Light sabers? Engaging story? Darth Vader? Well if you thought of one of those you are fine but if you thought of Jar Jar or the race please go back and watch the originals and see what star wars is really about.

Final Verdict: it is not bad, not good. but just there and will sort of be the movie that I will think the highest of when considering the prequels. 50% out of 100%."
"Apr 03, 2012",4,"Every story has a beginning, and this is the beginning of one of the greatest tales every told through cinema. 
Before there was Vader, before there were Rebels, before Princess Leia married Chewbacca?ah wait scratch that last part, 

There once was a little boy named Ani.
The chosen one the boy maybe, but many shadows surround his future.
He's just a boy, but yet the powerful energy that follows him is undeniable. 
Born to a virgin and living as a slave the Boy is miraculously discovered by a wise Jedi and taken under his wing., thus the events of fate begin to unfold.

Star Wars the Phantom menace, is a reference to the Jedi?s nemesis the evil and tyrannical Sith lords of the force, whose presence always remain hidden and shrouded in mystery. The Jedi who have long since fought off the Sith to there mere extinction, are now beginning to discover their revenge has been set in motion. 

But Star Wars is much more than just a story about Jedi and Sith, it is also very much about the vast and diverse world they live in and the humans and creatures they protect or seek to destroy. 

The vast emptiness of space yields itself to the dramatic events that are about to take place.  From the moment you watch the marquee scroll by you anticipate the excitement of what is about to transpire. As the title suggests Star Wars is a movie about intergalactic warfare and interstellar battles beyond the imagination. 

With a story so rich with origin and a predetermined future, it?s hard to live up to everyone?s expectations while filling in the gaps left open from this movies predecessors.
After all SW the Phantom menace is a prequel to the original Trilogy which broke box office records and cemented its place in the hearts of many adoring fans, 
However this film manages to recapture a few of those fond memories as well as attract a new age of audience to its following. 

The first chapter of a story general has a tough role to play, it has to establish characters and provide enough insight to interest the audience, and at the same time get the ball rolling in terms of plot development., this film is essentially the first chapter of the SW saga and delivers well on all aspects, including foreshadow. 

If you ever asked yourself what would SW be like without the villainous Darth Vader, or the heroic Luke Skywalker, this is exactly your ticket. Filling in the role of the villain you so love to hate is the mysterious and intimidating Darth Maul, whose tribal tattoos face paint and ornamental horns represent an evil of epic proportions. Maul?s silent nature is complimented by his dynamic actions and overwhelming presence.  His very essence seems to be designed to strike fear into the hearts of his adversaries.

As for the hero of our story, a young Obi Wan Kenobi takes up the role quite well as he inspires us to promote justice and pursue honor. He is mentored by his Master Qui Gon Jin, a considerate and compassionate Jedi if there ever was one. The acting talents of Liam Neison portray Qui Gon with a strong sense of grace and intelligence, as he acts as a father figure to both the boy and Kenobi. Ewen McGregor?s performance is likewise very sincere and emotionally profound. I greatly enjoyed watching the two of them share dialogue and play their part respectively. While on the other hand I found that Anakin?s
Character seemed to be a little misguided. The musical flute theme that represents his innocence is very stereotypical, along with his boyish sense of adventure and curiosity.
For a boy who was born and raised without a father and into slavery no less, it doesn?t quite add up logically that he would act this way.  It also doesn?t help when he makes expressions like Yipppee and Yeeaa. The overall feeling from his character is that he?s just too much of a perfect child to fit into the story as a main character; his personality merely isn?t complex enough.

However he?s not the worst by any means, the absolute most notorious personality to ever appear in a Star wars film makes his debut. He?s a walking talking disaster the size of big bird, by the name of Jar Jar Binks. Words cannot describe the abysmal qualities of this character. If they were looking to replace Chewbacca with another creative and colorful mascot character, they could have done a better job using a mop and a paint bucket with a smiley face drawn. Jar Jar Binks will go down in history as probably the most hated and ill conceived creation ever to come out of George Lucas?s brain. 

Moving on, Lucas relies heavily on the usage of CGI instead of props and puppetry to fill in the more imaginative gaps. Some prefer this method while other more traditional fans detest it. The CGI although entertaining and well animated, goes too far beyond reality and often creates a noticeable dividing line between itself and live action. 

The movie is chock loaded with spills and thrills, action sequences that will shock and amaze. The pod racing scene for example is one of the most enjoyable parts of the movie, and serves as a wonderful prelude to the grand finale. 

Exciting to say the least, the final battle is of such wide scale that it takes place from 4 different perspectives. Not only is there a battle taking place on land as well as in the sky, but our heroes, the Jedi are engaged in a light saber duel to the death, and as if that weren?t enough, the queen and her loyal bodyguards are busy infiltrating the enemies complex, in order to seize their commander. 

In dramatic fashion, just as it appears the good guys have lost and all hope is forsaken, an unlikely candidate saves the day, simply by pure luck.

Let the fireworks begin, after all it wouldn?t be Star wars without a few massive explosions, a la the Death Star.  How better to end the movie then bring all your characters together to celebrate their victory, and commemorate those who were lost? This is a wonderful representation of how togetherness can overwhelm adversity and triumph is more enjoyable when you share it.
Smiles, laughter, and praise, and as far as we know they all lived happily ever after, except Jar Jar Binks who was immediately executed. Now that would have been a truly happy ending.

Despite a few flaws with characters, overall SW ep 1 the Phantom Menace was a very enjoyable film, exciting, heartwarming, silly and adventurous. Highly memorable in more ways than one, and deserves to be treated as a classic."
"Apr 02, 2012",4,the character of darth maul was amazing
"Apr 02, 2012",4,"Plot was low. But was a real Star Wars movie. Introduced the series to modern generation. An awesome movie setting the tone for the proceeding movies .
CGI will piss you off, but it gets too much garbage, this is a very good film"
"Apr 01, 2012",4,best of the new trilogy.  the 3D was great fun but you could tell it was a conversion.
"Apr 01, 2012",4.5,"A few dull moments in the first chronological chapter of the Star Wars saga, nevertheless an exciting film all the same."
"Apr 01, 2012",5,Loved it. Subtle 3D but great!
"Mar 31, 2012",5,nice beggining to the saga
"Mar 31, 2012",4,"Despite the controversy, I really enjoyed this one.  Okay, it is a pile of crap in A LOT of places and disappointing after years of excitement - waiting for the prequels to debut, but looking back on it there are some decent things about it.  It's just a shame that Star Wars was ruined forever."
"Mar 31, 2012",2.5,"Eh ... Just not sure I ever believed that little kid could be Darth Vader.  Oh ... and now I remember why:  it's called ""character development"", Mr. Lucas.  Stop playing with your cool computer graphics and write a good story; that's what makes a great movie."
"Mar 31, 2012",4.5,Fuck it: this movie rocks!
"Mar 31, 2012",2,"The phantom menace is a very boring, uninspired, terribly written science-fcition film that is not exciting and poorly acted."
"Mar 31, 2012",3,"We had fun going back to the theatre to watch this. I still love Darth Maul and the duel scene, but the 3-D had much to be desired."
"Mar 30, 2012",2.5,"Writer-director George Lucas returned to his space opera with a half-hearted effort.  The imagination is still at work, and so is the ingenuity.  What's missing are characters that we care about in the context of good drama.  Jar Jar Binks deserves all of the negative press...This is actually better than Episode II, but that's not saying much."
"Mar 30, 2012",3.5,"Star Wars I - The Phantom Menace is a stunningly shot and edited film; a perfect and exciting visual feast for the eyes. Additionally, the new 3D enhancement gives this film a new sense of depth and believability. The negatives that prevent this film from earning a solid five stars from me was Lucas's lack of sound and prominent establishment of the film's tone, theme, and setting at the beginning. In addition, character development needs to be improved for everything felt a bit rushed and without time to really connect and understand the main characters."
"Mar 29, 2012",4.5,watching Yoda fight was worth the price of admition alone
"Mar 29, 2012",1.5,I guess this movie was good and they had a few parts that showed 3D. But I thought it was so boring. My friend enjoyed the first half because he sleped. The first half me and the kids asked to go to a other movie because they were bored and I know how to do the opening theme on the piano. Good movie I guess.
"Mar 29, 2012",4,This is like the only one I have seen.
"Mar 28, 2012",1,After a second look... complete crap.
"Mar 28, 2012",3,"After seeing 4,5, and 6 it is nice to see the more modern special effects but everything else is not as good. This movie is pretty long and boring a lot of times. I do not really like the actor for my manz Obi-Wan Kenobi. If i had watched this movie first before seeing the rest i probably would not have been as excited to see the other 5. The character development lacked a lot as well. I am hoping episodes 2 and 3 will make up for this"
"Mar 28, 2012",5,"XD ""I have a bad feeling about this!"""
"Mar 27, 2012",2.5,The weakest of the Star Wars movies. If I could condense this down to the first 10 minutes and the final 30 minutes it would be awesome. Unfortunately the back story of Anakin proves to be boring...
"Mar 26, 2012",5,"Jar jar binks was not that bad. Briskly paced and the best lightsaber duel is the Duel of fates between Darth Maul,Quigon Jin and Obi-Wan Kenobi trully spectacular"
"Mar 26, 2012",2,I'll leave Red Letter Media to give the review.
"Mar 25, 2012",5,"EXACT 
     &amp;
 GOOD"
"Mar 25, 2012",4,"This movie is certainly stunning and entertaining to a higher degree than its darker sequels, but the charme from the original series with Harrison Ford is gone."
"Mar 25, 2012",1.5,"If there is a better example of the waste that is 3D, this is it.

Enough was written about this movie at its original release, its poorly drawn characters, its hackneyed storyline, its utter inability to grab and hold on to the viewer, I really don't need to repeat it all here. But I never saw the original in a theater, and so, in a moment of weakness, I decided to take in a 3D matinee.

To be fair, the expansive landscapes really do lend themselves well to the big screen. And the special effects are top-notch. But jumping on the 3D bandwagon by converting the original is nothing better than (a) a waste and (b) a weaselly way for George Lucas &amp; Co. to extract more money from the franchise. 

This release epitomized exactly what I've been saying for years about 3D: it doesn't help bad stories, and good stories don't need it. 

Really, only a few scenes in the entire 2-plus hours got any 3D treatment, and none of them were helped by it. I actually removed my 3D glasses during stretches of the movie and found no 3D effects going on, so I could just watch a brighter picture and focus on what passed for story, acting, directing, and characterization. 

Bottom line, unless you want to experience again the lushness and beauty of the movie's visuals on a big screen, this release earns a hearty ""stay away,"" along with a renewed resolve to actively seek out 2D showings of good movies and to communicate with theater management that you are specifically avoiding 3D releases, that your money will be spend on 2D tickets."
"Mar 25, 2012",1,"3d review: The film itself is overlong, horribly written, crappy computer effects, wooden chacarcetrs/ acting, no human emotion like the original trilogy. Just boring plots and charcter aarchs that make this film, boring, bland, tedious, irritating and plain nasty. The 3d makes this film even worse, it makes everything look dimmer and flatter and rarely makes anything POP"
"Mar 25, 2012",3,This one to me has the best lightsaber duel aside from the Ob-Wan/Anakin battle in Episode III
"Mar 24, 2012",4,"The end of the twentieth century certainly had its share of surprises, one of them being the Y2K scare, another being cries of rape being leveled at George Lucas.  The focus of this, still fairly popular, craze was ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,"" and has since gone on to include episodes 2 &amp; 3 of the popular Hexalogy.  I saw it opening day in 1999 and had the chance to recently revisit it 13 years later in theatres.
  *spoiler alert*
  The story shows the beginnings of Palpatine's carefully calculated takeover of the galactic republic, and the discovery of Darth Vader to be: Anakin Skywalker.  
  The trade federation has placed a trade blockade on Naboo, in response Chancellor Vallorum sends Qui-Gon Jinn, and Obi Wan Kenobi to help negotiate a treaty between Queen Amidala (Luke and Leia's mom) and the TF.  Things don't go well, and the jedi are forced to leave the planet with the Queen, her double (Keira Knightley) and a Jamaican frog seems a lot more tolerable after having lived through Nickleback, the Twilight Saga, Teen Mom, the last ten years of the Simpsons, and Snooki.  They land on Tatooine where Qui Gon Discovers little Anakin, we discover that the force is channeled through microscopic creatures in your bloodstream, and Darth Maul proves just how badass the Sith really are.  Blah blah blah, politics... blah blah blah yoda disapproves of Anakin... blah blah blah LIGHTSABER FIGHT!  
  The big battles are a lot of fun to watch, and the lightsaber battle was a blast all these years later.
  Does it hold up?  Somewhat.  The effects are still great over a decade later, The acting is still pretty wooden, and Jake Lloyd needs to be punched in  the face every time he delivers a line, but that's how its always been.  The difference for me is one of being a teenager, and then of being in my late twenties.  
  I still enjoy the film quite a bit, but I don't think that the 3d added much to the proceedings.  
  The fanboys are a lot quieter nowadays regarding the prequels and their childhood.  I think that the most telling sign of why was while I was sitting in the theatre getting ready to relive some memories of my own.  I looked around and saw a decent chunk of fanboys, original late trilogy on, with their extremely excited kids taking up most of the seats.  Those kids were DEAD SILENT during the entire film.  
  I'm guessing that more than a few future fanboys were created at that screening."
"Mar 24, 2012",5,great film great in 3d
"Mar 24, 2012",3,"Decent film, but it fell short or expectations."
"Mar 23, 2012",3.5,I think everyone was expecting this to be better. The aliens dont have the same charm as the originals and actually do more harm than good. Darth Maul and the Pod Race saved this movie. Jar Jar is perhaps the most annoying character in film history.
"Mar 23, 2012",5,STAR WARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so not only for nerds
"Mar 23, 2012",4,"Done right, just not as well as it should have been.  Lucas did everything right.  New races, ships, droids, planets, characters and bad guys connected with characters we know: Jabba, Anakin, R2, 3PO, Obi Wan.  Very good progression from how everyone gets involved and the roles they are to play.  Enough to look new and be a new adventure to new comers, and enough of a connection to entice us old fogies.  Not that just having star wars on the marquee wouldn't have brought us in any way.  The Princess was a little too mono tone for me, but I can get over it.  The droids were dumb, it works for the animated series, but for the most part it was annoying.  I couldn't understand the leaders of the Federation, who could understand Jar Jar for the first time.  It was just annoying.  I don't need comic relief, I need a good story.  Overall, good show."
"Mar 23, 2012",2.5,Thou should watch red letter's media review :p
"Mar 23, 2012",1,Some neat design work gets lost in a dreadfully cobbled together reassembly of the Star Wars backstory.  Totally boring and out of touch.
"Mar 23, 2012",1.5,George... you know why!
"Mar 23, 2012",4,"Starts great but just kind of drifts through the rest of it. Still, it's the first Star Wars film in 20 years!"
"Mar 22, 2012",3.5,That Jar Jar Binks really annoyed me.
"Mar 22, 2012",2,"There's a certain magic to the Star Wars films and the idea of creating prequels would've been nice, but then we all saw it.  I can take crappy movies to a certain extent and The Phantom Menace nearly exceeds that. The story is a complete mess, the characters are boring and shares very little similarities to what I had enjoyed about the original trilogy.  The film barely even manages to retain any interesting action sequences and the idea of me saying that to something that shares the same title as Star Wars is flabbergasting."
"Mar 22, 2012",1.5,Hollow &amp; a disgrace to the Star Wars brand.
"Mar 21, 2012",2.5,Haven't I seen this already?!?!
"Mar 21, 2012",4.5,I love all Star Wars!
"Mar 21, 2012",2,"A lot of people say this movie is garbage, and you know what? That's right. I always used to protect this film (as it was indeed my first Star Wars film), but after I re-watched it in 3D not too long ago, I realized how utterly boring and somewhat dumb the movie is. It tries to be epic and wise, but a lot of the plot elements don't make any sense, and while the CG effects are nice, the physical effects (suits, puppets, etc.) look like crap. It isn't a disgrace, but it isn't very good either."
"Mar 20, 2012",3,"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... George Lucas made millions of fans happy with the announcement that STAR WARS was coming back.  Then he made millions of fan boys angry by serving up 3 not-so-great films.

I will always come down in favor of the prequel trilogy.  No, they weren't necessarily the films I wanted.  Yes, they are full of problems.  The story of Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side of the force and eventual rebirth as Darth Vader should be epic and glorious, and mesmerizing.  Unfortunately, the journey is bogged down by far to much political maneuvering (which believe it or not, I actually enjoy those scenes, as Palpatine is my favorite character in the new trilogy), Scooby-Doo sub plots, annoying animated characters, clumsy dialogue and bewildering editing.  But there are moments of glory, and since I look at fandom through rose-colored lenses, I choose to focus on the glory.

But focusing became a bit tougher through those 3D glasses...

I know everyone is down on up converting movies into 3D, and I'm not a fan of the practice myself.  But I got giddy with anticipation when I heard Lucas was doing STAR WARS.  For all their flaws, these are the kind of movies that 3D was made for.  Big, fast, loud and in-your-face.  So I eagerly plopped down my cash, fit the glasses on and waited for the lights to dim.

The results were mixed.  The opening crawl pops with this real floating effect that was super cool.  Then the film started.  PHANTOM MENACE suffers from the nuts and bolts of that galaxy far, far way.  Two Jedi are dispatched to deal with a trade dispute.  Um... TRADE DISPUTE!?!?  This is STAR WARS, GEORGE!  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor totally anchor this film as Qui-gon and Obi-wan, and they pop very much to the foreground of their shots on the Trade Federation ship, but the rest of the backgrounds look... well, like backgrounds.  Almost like a flat view screen behind them.  And not a high definition plasma view screen, but a I-just-pulled-the-string-and-un-rolled-this-on-the-wall-of-my-school-for-an-asssymbly kinda screen.  The fights with the battle droids on the streets of Naboo were cool.  Escaping the blockade was cool.

The movie drags when we arrive on Tatooine and get bogged down in the Anakin and the middiclorian plot.  The ship is broke, they meet Anakin, he can help them win the parts they need by racing.  Might as well have yelled ""Move along, nothing to see here!""  The pod race however, may be worth the price of admission by itself.  And, this is the DVD / blue ray print of the film, so the race is there in all three laps of orgasmic speed rush.

The arrival on Courriscant was cool, but then we bog down again in the interesting to watch but not fun to look at in 3D political mechanics.  I absolutely love how slimy and manipulative Palpatine is.  I marvel at watching him and his plans and schemes unfold, knowing what is coming, and cant look away anytime he's on screen.  Ian McDiarmid is an acting wonder.

We return to Naboo to put an end to the blockade and find 3D effects make the lightsaber battle to be cool, but not as good as I would have imagined, the battle with the droid army to be cool, but not as good as I would have imagined, and the space battle to be a downright disappointment.  I was so looking forward to that, but as it un-spooled, I realized that in space there is no frame of reference for the 3D to create a background to pop out of, and the ships fly by so fast that I couldn't tell if it was 3D or not anyway.  Surprisingly, the best part was Padme and troops fighting their way up to the palace throne room.  Those shots looked fantastic.

All-in-all it wasn't a waste of money.  ANY excuse to see STAR WARS on the big screen is a worthwhile one.  But watching it in 3D wasn't the religious experience I thought it would be.  YET.  Because all PHANTOM MENACE did was wet my appetite for the good ones to show up.

STAR WARS: EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE - Film - C+ / 3D - B-"
"Mar 20, 2012",2,"Not much to say on this one, perhaps one of the greatest disappointments in film history. But still better than Clone Wars."
"Mar 20, 2012",1,George Lucas' hyperdrive is leaking. You-sa in big doo-doo dis time!
"Mar 20, 2012",4,I hated jar jar though
"Mar 20, 2012",0.5,Probably one of the worst movies ever made on its scale.
"Mar 20, 2012",0.5,"You guessed it, in '99 this received terrible reviews, and now in 2012 in 3D it is still a terrible film and an insult to the saga."
"Mar 20, 2012",4,"fially we can see the beginning of the story
best scene: seeing Natalie in action"
"Mar 20, 2012",5,Star Wars are the best movies ever!
"Mar 19, 2012",3,"My least favorite star wars film, Darth Maul was cool, young anakin got annoying after awhile."
"Mar 19, 2012",3,"(WARNING - This review is not based on the 3D version of the films) Set many years before 'A New Hope'. The Phantom Menace follows the story of Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi-Master, and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi. The pair start out as being assigned to negotiate the terms of the release of the planet Naboo, which has been completely cut off from the rest of the galaxy by the greedy trade union. Things take a darker turn when the Trade Union try to have the Jedi murdered, with the pair narrowly escaping and making their way onto the planet. Together with the princess and their handmaidens, they escape to Tatooine where the group meets with Anakin Skywalker. Political deception, the battle for Naboo, new alliances and  new enemies continue the film...

WHAT I LIKED: I feel that there is something genuinely fresh about this film, and think that it gets a much worse wrap than it deserves. The acting, for the most part, is well up to bar; especially Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon. The pod racing scene and the battle for Naboo deliver brilliant visuals in light and airy settings, so unusual considering the battles in the following films. And I couldn't possibly leave this section without mentioning Darth Maul. A fantastic Sith Lord who was hideously underwritten.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Jar Jar Binks... I'm sorry, it's such a typical thing that a lot of people say about the film, but as a character I found him to be infuriating! ALong with this there were a few issues I had with some of the writing and felt that the balance between action and comic relief was poorly pulled off.

CONCLUSION: I do not feel that this is a film anyone can miss, despite my relatively low marking of it, because I think the Star Wars franchise should be seen by anyone who considers themselves a fan of film or of movies and as a result, I'd recommend you start at the beginning."
"Mar 19, 2012",2,The force is not with this one.
"Mar 18, 2012",3,"I thought this was over long, but my 7 year olds loved. So gave it an extra star for that."
"Mar 18, 2012",0.5,Jar jar in 2D was bad enough! Jar jar in 3D is just enough to make you want to slit your wrists.
"Mar 18, 2012",1,only decent thing is darth maul.. rest is kak

"Mar 17, 2012",4,"I don't care what anyone says, Jar Jar is great and I still find him funny.  This film is under rated it's not A New Hope but very very enjoyable."
"Mar 17, 2012",3,The 3d and the movie was terrible
"Mar 16, 2012",3.5,"Eh... it was boring. I mean, in episodes IV, V, and VI we have things exploding, saving princesses, and amazing scenes. In this one we have senate debates and Trade Federations. The end and the podracing was the sole reason I gave this film 3 stars. It was amazing. One thing that I was a little bored about more was that the special effects were mostly CGI. They were amazing SFX, but they didn't have that sense of mystery like in the original trilogy. You knew that it was all done on a computer, so it was impossible to think about. One other thing I was disappointed about was that annoying little fish-face Jar Jar Binks. Halfway through the movie, I had a headache before realizing it was the result of his high-pitched voice and fails at slapstick. Overall, it is a movie worth watching, if you can get through the senate room and Binks's annoying character."
"Mar 15, 2012",2,3D aspect of the film was very disappointing
"Mar 14, 2012",2.5,"finally, the Star Wars saga has completed its first episode, now also in 3D, I watched the movie in 3D, the movie lacks a story as good as the others, thus being the weakest film in the series, yet has great scenes action, but the character Jar Jar Binks ends up being a delay in the film, despite the constant errors, the film has many good points, and is the highlight for the final confrontation between Qui-Gon Jin, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul.Unfortunately the film is very weak and is the only film of the saga all I did not like, I can not give more than 3 stars for this film because he does not deserve more stars, my score from 0 a10 is 6.1"
"Mar 14, 2012",3.5,"Star Wars: Episode 1 is the weakest Star war films, but it is still decently entertaining non the less."
"Mar 14, 2012",3,Not empire strikes back
"Mar 14, 2012",3.5,Kind of uneventful until Darth Maul appears. Only reason I give it higher than 2 stars.
"Mar 14, 2012",4,Episodes 1 and 3 so far outweigh number 2. Really good way to re-start the frnachise.
"Mar 14, 2012",3,"We all know that 3D is the future of entertainment, and the 3D in Phantom Menace does a decent job, particularly the Pod Race scene. But what Star Wars fans are really waiting for is when the saga gets the 3D treatment on Blu-Ray, then it can really come alive with the superior HD clarity of home 3D TVs. If you go and see this with that in mind, you won't be disappointed, but undoubtedly the 3D Blu-Ray release is what we really want."
"Mar 13, 2012",2,The Only good thing is this film is Darth Maul everything else is bad.
"Mar 12, 2012",3,"There are a lot of positive aspects to it, it's just Jar Jar Binks and young Anakin Skywalker are some of the worst characters in the Star Wars universe."
"Mar 12, 2012",2,The overused special effects in conjunction with the bland characters and boring plot make the phantom menace a very huge disappointment.
"Mar 12, 2012",2.5,I was probably the best star wars prequel but not nearly as good as the originals it might be a movie rent if there wasn't anything better to watch even in 3d not very convinced
"Mar 12, 2012",3,"Let's face it; 3-D effects can't redeem this, any more than they could save mid-80s farce, Mannequin--interesting view it may newly offer of Kim Cattrall's bust.  Because bad writing is bad writing and there ain't no way around it. Three words: Jar Jar Binks."
"Mar 12, 2012",3,"Den sÃ¤msta av alla 6 filmerna, Jar Jar och lill Anakin fÃ¶rstÃ¶r filmen."
"Mar 12, 2012",1.5,Worst. Star Wars. Ever.
"Mar 11, 2012",4,Saw it in 3d some good scenes but felt 70% of it was 2d tho
"Mar 11, 2012",2.5,"The worst in the series in my opinion. Very boring story, horrible characters, the effects weren't so good, and ultimately is hated throughout the fan base. Jar Jar Binks is a unnecessary character that adds nothing to the story and the film offers little to the Star Wars universe than the back story of a few characters."
"Mar 11, 2012",2.5,"It is a ok movie, but compared to the three Star Wars films that made the franchise, it falls short."
"Mar 10, 2012",3,"I saw The Phantom Menace in 3D today and it was... The Phantom Menace... in 3D.  It was a novelty to go see it BECAUSE it was 3D, and virtually free thanks to some movie passes and gift cards i've had for two years, so whatever.  The script was horrible, the directing garbage, the pod race had some good 3D effect, the light saber fights were the shit, Jar Jar Binks needs a bullet in his head, but at least Darth Maul is freaking awesome."
"Mar 10, 2012",4,"although not a bad movie its just not the strongest of the star wars movies, i mean theres plenty of stuff to make this good like Anakin skywalker and darthe maul and Qui-gon ect but its not the strongest of the star wars saga and not my favorite and granted there is a good story in it and good characters but there are points in the movie that just slow the movie down too much like the polotics and some of the jedi action seems allittle boring (not darth maul thats awsome) so theres not much else to really say. athough not the strongest, it still holds up to become a star wars classic"
"Mar 10, 2012",3,I loved this movie. But star wars episode 2 attack of the clones and star wars episode 3 revenge of the sith were better. My two favriot are Qui gon jinn and Darth maul. Liam Nesson and Ray Park are good actors.
"Mar 09, 2012",2,"I am a certified ""hater"" of this ""episode"", and while the 3D treatment was top of the line, it didn't matter."
"Mar 09, 2012",1,Was not originally made in 3D it sucked!!
"Mar 09, 2012",3.5,"My first 3D movie and the first time I have seen any of the Star Wars saga on the big screen.  The experience was great, however, this is, by far, my least favorite Star Wars movie. Death to Jar Jar!"
"Mar 09, 2012",3,"Except a lot more improved special effects, this film is much worse than the classic first three sequels. My favorite character from the seventy's star wars C-3PO was given a little time this time  which has been really disappointing for me."
"Mar 09, 2012",3.5,Good movie by one of this centuries best director and producers. Not up to the par that was set by the previous starwars but was still a good watch for anybody.
"Mar 09, 2012",4,First installment of Star Wars saga.
"Mar 08, 2012",4,"As a ten year-old, going to the theater for the 1999 release, yes, I did think Jar-Jar was pretty cool. Regardless of that, John Williams provides an epic soundtrack for a visually epic movie."
"Mar 08, 2012",1,Pish bar the fight scene near the end
"Mar 08, 2012",3,On my way 2 see this in 3D. I really only wanna see the light saber duel at the end.
"Mar 07, 2012",4,Star Wars was fun movie can't wait for next Star Wars movie
"Mar 07, 2012",4,Love star wars I don't under stand y people don't like this one but I love it the first time I saw it and I loved it in 3d
"Mar 07, 2012",3,Harshly maligned state-of-the-art kids' sci-fi whose spectacular set-pieces outshine the clunkiness of the dialogue and performances.
"Mar 07, 2012",2,The 3D was just horrid.
"Mar 06, 2012",5,one of my Favorite films ever. and I love the 3D
"Mar 06, 2012",1.5,The worst of the Whole series.
"Mar 06, 2012",2.5,I'll go on record by saying it's not a good film but it's not a bad film.  Darth Maul makes up for a not present Darth Vader but corny dialogue and the ever so annoying Jar Jar Binks are what keep this film from being great.
"Mar 05, 2012",1.5,"Still a disappointment, even seeing it again with lowered expectations. Design is the only strength in the movie. The cities, ships, creatures, and 'droids are all exceptionally well designed and nice to look at. The story is routine, the dialog atrocious. Even some exceedingly good actors often can't deliver the lines with any credibility and poor Jake Lloyd doesn't stand a chance against his lines as young Anakin Skywalker. He does pretty well when not forced to speak, though. And Ray Park, of course, moves well as Darth Maul. There's never any real suspense, though, as we don't care a whit about what happens to anyone in the movie. The original trilogy was all about relationships against a backdrop of politics and war. Here politics and war are brought to the fore with relationships barely receiving any notice. And the post conversion 3D is minimal and pointlessness only serving, when it's at all noticeable, to make things look even more artificial."
"Mar 05, 2012",3,"Saw it 3 times in the theater, first Star Wars movie I ever actually watched. Cheesy and weird and sometimes annoying...but it looked pretty."
"Mar 05, 2012",2.5,"It was much better 13 years ago when I saw it a bunch of times in the theater. I rank it fifth among Star Wars films. Darth Maul is the best part of this movie and would have made a better prequel villian than Count Dooku. He should have had a bigger part.  More Maul and less pod racing would have been a good thing. 

Oh, and midichlorians were a dumb idea."
"Mar 05, 2012",2.5,I admit to liking this movie only for nostalgic reasons. It's very much like any Star Wars film; just fun to watch.
"Mar 05, 2012",5,it was 1 of many great 3 d movies  to come
"Mar 05, 2012",1.5,"Plain awful.  The storyline and script were horrendous, as was much of the acting.  Even the fight and race scenes were lack luster.  Very disappointing."
"Mar 05, 2012",1,"3d was shit, it was basically just in Blu-ray"
"Mar 05, 2012",3,I like it more than most. What more can be said that hasn't already been said? Goosebumps during the climax.
"Mar 05, 2012",2.5,"The hype was sky high and it unfortunately didn't transfer well to the revisit of this saga. Modern CGI is favored over the realism of such techniques like stop motion and puppetry, condemning the prequel series from the start."
"Mar 05, 2012",4,"Give George a break, it is good"
"Mar 05, 2012",3,Unfortunately all the 3d did was make me sit through this film in the cinema again and this tine i thought it aas a real slow watch and the 3d was pointless as well
"Mar 04, 2012",4.5,"I don't understand the hate against it. It's probably my favourite Star Wars film (childhood memories make everything better). And it was great in 3D (although definitely not as immersive as say, Avatar). It's certainly more family-friendly, but at times the series takes itself too seriously, and Jar-Jar lightened things up a bit. The pod race still stands as one of my favourite film scenes ever."
"Mar 04, 2012",4,"Great to see it on the big screen again,yes it does work in places with the 3d."
"Mar 04, 2012",1.5,"If I want crap thrown at me in 3D, I'll go visit the monkeys at the zoo."
"Mar 04, 2012",2,This really did NOT need to be in 3D. I think I nearly fell asleep watching it.
"Mar 04, 2012",4,Watched with nephew and brother in law. Had a great time and loved the 3d. Can't wait for Clones.
"Mar 04, 2012",2,"These three movies are lame, lame and more lame.  The plot is lame, the acting is lame and the story is lame.  The movie is just flat out weak.  It is also very dark.  I don't go to the movies to be depressed.  Also, why would George Lucas take the powerfull Jedi and make them sooooo lame!  They had the Dark Sith Lord right under their noses and they can't even see him sitting right next to them.  Also, JarJar Binks was the worst character ever in any movie."
"Mar 04, 2012",2.5,"Saw this in 3D recently and wow does this movie not hold up...I saw it opening day back in 1999 and LOVED IT! Now that I'm 12 years older, I see it for what it is: a hollow, lifeless shadow of the original trilogy. The characters are boring, the dialog is atrocious, and the pacing is all over the place. I won't even mention Jar Jar Binks because we ALL remember how much he sucks..."
"Mar 04, 2012",3,"Never saw this before, so it filled in some gaps of the Star Wars anthology.  Not great but good."
"Mar 04, 2012",3.5,"Mediocre in most regards, but improved with the 3D conversion and upon second viewing in 3D, properly enjoyed myself, whenever Jar Jar Binks was off screen...."
"Mar 04, 2012",0.5,Come on. So so awful.
"Mar 04, 2012",2,"Movie great, 3D horrible"
"Mar 04, 2012",3.5,All good except for Jar-Jar
"Mar 04, 2012",3.5,"The most hated of the series...and though I must agree with most of the criticism, I still think it's an entertaining film that, though obviously not comparable to the original series, is somewhat decent, and definitely, to me, better than its sluggish successor."
"Mar 04, 2012",1,"another Lucas spin. watchout, it will be out in black and white on the back of the ""Artist """
"Mar 04, 2012",1.5,"It was an *alright* film, but I resented being ripped off for the additional few minutes that were in 3D.  The special effects were spectacular anyway, plus the whole film was shot digitally - 3D added nothing to it.  If you haven't seen it on the big screen then it's worth seeing, but don't go for the 3D expecting to be wowed because you will be disappointed."
"Mar 04, 2012",2.5,I was so looking forward to seeing this movie in 3D but was so disappointed.
"Mar 04, 2012",4,"This Is Not the 3D Review!!

This film was very underrated....This site giving it 57% is way too low. It deserves at least 65-75%...Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson's  acting were very good but the i think the worst acting was by maybe Natalie Portman...Her acting was alright but wasn't the best in the movie....Very good beginning to the new trilogy of Star Wars...My 2nd fav Star Wars film behind Empire Strikes Back!!"
"Mar 03, 2012",2,Wasn't a great film 13 years ago.  Now it's not a great film in 3D.
"Mar 03, 2012",3,"My least favorite of the 6 films, fair 3d effects, fun to see Star Wars on the bog screen again"
"Mar 03, 2012",2,Didn't get into it at all. Disappointment
"Mar 03, 2012",3,The 3D feature was alright
"Mar 03, 2012",5,I seen Star Wars - Episode one . I really liked watching this movie.
"Mar 03, 2012",0.5,This movie gets worse every time I see it. The 3D was a joke. Should have left after the star wars logo.
"Mar 03, 2012",3,"2nd time that we watched this movie.Must say this second time around we really enjoyed it. Nonetheless, if we did not have had a free ticket for the once more never ending new edition in 3D AT THE IMAX, we wouldn't have never made the choice to go and watch it. But as jeday say, there's no coincidence. And so after 10 years of exploited stupid take on the saga on the web, it has been more than a pleasure watching Star Wars again in the place it was made for...the big screen .."
"Mar 03, 2012",5,If you are a Star Wars Fan then the 3d is worth it.
"Mar 03, 2012",2.5,It was a good movie but there was no 3d
"Mar 03, 2012",3.5,"I still like the movie, but it feels like the 3d aspect was rushed. The effect was lacking ""pop"" but I do admit the pod race scene was pretty great."
"Mar 03, 2012",4,Pod racing in 3D. What else do I have to say?
"Mar 03, 2012",4.5,Great Movie what's Wrong with these Movies?? it's Great .Even Better in 3D Yes I saw both of them
"Mar 03, 2012",1,"Actually fell asleep 3 ""THREE"" times during this 3D movie - lol"
"Mar 03, 2012",3,"Great movie, but the 3D didn't really enhance it. The movie wasn't originally made for 3D and there wasn't much in it that jumps out and grabs you. Still love the movie and the franchise though."
"Mar 03, 2012",1,God worst Star Wars ever...terrible. George Lucas hates his fans.
"Mar 02, 2012",4,"it was fun and enjoyable, and I can't see why people hate this movie so much."
"Mar 02, 2012",3,"Great movie except for Jar Jar. 3D not impressive though, waste of time. Most of the movie you couldn't even tell it was in 3D"
"Mar 02, 2012",5,"Great movie! The 3D is not like popping out like it is going to touch you, but you can really tell its 3D."
"Mar 02, 2012",4,Nothing better than a Star Wars movie on the big screen. 3D wasn't as amazing as I had hoped since it was an adaptation but my 5 year old son LOVED it!
"Mar 02, 2012",3,"not as good as 4, 5 &amp; 6"
"Mar 02, 2012",4,Amazing!  Felt just like a kid again!  Surprisingly this movie is one of the better ones I have seen this year.  And it is over 10 years old...  C'mon Hollywood.  We need some more A game material before summer actually gets here.
"Mar 02, 2012",2,Maybe the 3-D effects will make the 1-Dimensional characters look at least 2-D.
"Mar 02, 2012",3,the 3d did not make it any better! it was still good to see it again.
"Mar 02, 2012",4,"I am unabashedly a Star Wars fanboy, and while this movie was weaker than the others (aside from, perhaps, Attack of the Clones), it's still an important film.

Yes, Jar Jar Binks was annoying, I'll grant the haters that. And the acting wasn't fantastic. But if you think the Star Wars saga has ever been about quality acting, go back and watch the originals - the acting was never great then either. It was all about storytelling and special effects.

I like this one. I has a lightsaber duel in it. That's enough to keep me going."
"Mar 01, 2012",3.5,May as well watch the original with sunglasses on.
"Mar 01, 2012",3.5,Star Wars is epic and The Phantom Menace is a great start to a great series.
"Mar 01, 2012",2.5,"I took my 14 year old girl to see it.  She liked it.  I loved the final scenes, but I don't think the 3D enhanced anything.  Still, it's Star Wars."
"Mar 01, 2012",1,I feel this film being release on 3-D has kind of ruined the film for me personally
"Mar 01, 2012",3,"only about 10% of film in 3d.not much need for those good lookin glasses,a few scenes look different(yet again)still good to watch again on big screen though"
"Mar 01, 2012",2.5,"Huge let down, my least favorite Star Wars film."
"Mar 01, 2012",3,"Was the 3D even turned on?  I expected to see stuff flying at me, this could have been so much more especially considering most of the movie is CGI anyways"
"Mar 01, 2012",3,"I was bored with the original why waste money on ""3D""."
"Feb 29, 2012",2,"The movie gets one star for introducing the Darth Maul character and I'll add a second star for the decent use of 3D. This 3D re-release has been a dud for Lucas, wonder if he will abandon releasing any more of the films."
"Feb 29, 2012",0.5,George Lucas is a cunt. That is all.
"Feb 29, 2012",4,"3D invisible ou presque, aucun intérêt sinon le plaisir de revoir sur grand écran le début de la saga.... Vivement la suite !!!"
"Feb 29, 2012",3,"Loved Liam Neeson and I liked the story. Some of the acting was weak and uninspired. I felt like special effects came first and the performances of actors were an afterthought. However, I enjoyed the movie overall."
"Feb 29, 2012",2.5,"I actually find this movie to be underrated. The battles Are pretty neat and the pod racing is cool. The story is bland, Jake Lloyd is and annoyence. It defiantly isn't anyware close to being as good as the original trilogy but it is better then Attack of the Clones."
"Feb 29, 2012",2,Star Wars fan.... This film did not have to be in 3D. Most films that are now of days do not need to be.  My sons enjoyed the race in 3D
"Feb 29, 2012",1,"I have no idea why I was wearing the 3D glasses at all.  The 3D previews were cool, though."
"Feb 29, 2012",3,"Only Star Wars movie I've ever really watched, and that was when it first came out in the theaters years ago. Still like it, kinda long tho.."
"Feb 28, 2012",2.5,"It should be retitled ""Star Wars Episode 1: Darth Maul"""
"Feb 28, 2012",3.5,"Having now seen Episode I as a more mature person (and in 3D!), I understand that explosions, spaceships, and lightsabers aren't the only thing that make great Star Wars movies. Some characters in this film are so damn wacky (I'm NOT only referring to Jar Jar) that it's hard to ever take them seriously. Liam Neeson carries this movie from start to finish, with help from Ewan McGregor and, to an extent, Natalie Portman. It's hard to really get engaged with any character besides Qui-Gon Jinn (Leeson) and Anakin (only because we all know what he becomes).

The action is all there, and in 3D, it's a blast. I really enjoyed the film, but it just lacks the magic of the first three (4-6)."
"Feb 28, 2012",2,"This is easily the start of transforming great classic movies into a quickly expanding 3D world of film. I do enjoy that it was a very well done transformation, but sadly is lack luster due to a lot of backgriund blurring to get images to pop. It is still worth it to see this movie, but dont see it for the full art and depth the origonal film offers. Subtle things were added, like a window pane in one shot, to give a further illusion of 3D which like I stated works great for making it 3D, but hurts the original beauty of the film."
"Feb 28, 2012",3,3D effects not so great. Jar Jar Binks is still annoying! Other than that it was still decent
"Feb 28, 2012",1,"Like Tommy Wiseau's The Room, but with lightsabres."
"Feb 28, 2012",3,"The 3D was a bit disapointing but, since its release long time ago, it was nice to see the movie in a much bigger screen than at home. Jar-Jar Binks is still anoying in any dimension..."
"Feb 28, 2012",4,Only because I love Star Wars.. Not a lot of of 3-D difference. I actually thought the Sarth maul/Jedi Scene would be cooler in 3-D.
"Feb 28, 2012",2,Disappointed in the 3D I don't feel they should have tried to make this movie in 3D.
"Feb 28, 2012",0.5,This movie is so painful to watch.  I am going to try to remember George Lucas when he used to be good... before he went senile evident by this crap.  If it was not good in 2-D WHY THE HELL WOULD IT BE GOOD IN 3-D?
"Feb 27, 2012",3,3-D effect was melodramatic especially the race scene.
"Feb 27, 2012",5,star wars is great. good to see the trilogy on the big screen!
"Feb 27, 2012",2,Movie isn't too good. This will probably be the last post-production 3-D movie I pay to see. It added nothing to this film.
"Feb 27, 2012",1.5,"Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, 3 way lightsaber battle are the only reasons to watch this. Everything else... GARBAGE! Jar Jar needs to be completely erased from this film and history."
"Feb 27, 2012",2.5,"Underrated, but I see why all the fans hate it"
"Feb 27, 2012",5,awsome in 3D every guy is in your face and pod and lightsaber battles are great am i the only who likes jar jar binks?
"Feb 27, 2012",1.5,Worst Star Wars film ever! Re-watching in 3d is somewhat worthwhile. The 3d conversion is pretty good. But they should'v found a way to write off Jar Jar!
"Feb 27, 2012",4,In spite of its shortcomings this is a dazzling film to look at!  The 3-D really fills it out.
"Feb 27, 2012",2,"It's still episode 1,lucas has (correctly) replaced the muppet Yoda with the superior cgi version,but neglected to take the opportunity to give us less Jar Jar!"
"Feb 27, 2012",3,"Decent. I just went to see what it was like in 3D, but not sure it was worth $16. Movies are highly overpriced these days."
"Feb 27, 2012",4,"Aside from the fact that it's the worst movie of the series, it was a fun way to introduce Star Wars to my 6-year-old! The 3D conversion was really well done!"
"Feb 27, 2012",5,not as good as the first three but still great
"Feb 27, 2012",3,I enjoyed the subtlety of the 3D in this movie. The depth it added was fantastic and the whole movie looked great. Of course we all know the flaws in the story but I still really enjoyed the experience. 3D pod race and 3D Darth Maul light sabre battle was worth the admission price!
"Feb 27, 2012",4.5,"dont see why everyone dogs this movie..my favorite by far besides ""revenge of the sith""...i thought the worst ones were ""a new hope"" and ""attack of the clones""...i never get tired of watching this one...darth maul is awesome"
"Feb 26, 2012",2.5,"Darth maul, action. and ........."
"Feb 26, 2012",5,Great movie as an original!!! Even better with the added 3D effect! I was loving every minute of it!
"Feb 26, 2012",5,Star Wars &gt; everything else in life.
"Feb 26, 2012",5,it had everything a movie should have other than horror in 2 hours
"Feb 26, 2012",3.5,It's true... I'm a sucker for any movie with a light saber in it...
"Feb 26, 2012",3.5,I definitely enjoyed it.  I wasn't sure if I would but it was awesome.  Looking forward to seeing the rest
"Feb 26, 2012",0.5,"Saw it in 3D, but it was the same, nothing was in 3D!"
"Feb 26, 2012",2.5,It was nice to see star wars in the cinema again however it is still the worst one of them all and the 3d is hardly noticeable so your basically paying to see star wars in 2d but with a darker screen.
"Feb 26, 2012",3.5,Of course we went to see it :)
"Feb 26, 2012",2,The 3D was a Joke! The movie looked the same with or without the 3D glasses! Forget trying to reproduce a movie in 3D!
"Feb 26, 2012",2,"I went into this not knowing crap about the franchise, just little tidbits from cultural references in other movies and TV shows. I thought it was the 1977 original, then I found out this was from 1999. The title is totally misleading, and I also thought that it was from 1977 because the CG-I blew. Anyways, the 3D was mediocre at best, but the absolute worst was the pacing, which was horrendous. This could have been 30 minutes shorter. 4/10, F, two thumbs down, etc."
"Feb 26, 2012",1.5,"The 3D did not help this film at all. Something you could/would see on TV Saturday morning.  After seeing this, putting these films back on the big screen in 3D is not a good idea nor is it worth the money."
"Feb 26, 2012",0.5,"Sat thru the last 30 minutes waiting for another movie. It was worse then I remembered. Boring, uninspired 3D as well. Lucas should writhe in hell for that movie. Awful. Just awful."
"Feb 26, 2012",1,Worst movie ever made
"Feb 26, 2012",5,"Amazing. I don't care what other people think, it was worth it. Just ask the other 15 teens I went and saw the movie with."
"Feb 26, 2012",1,"No plot, no protagonist, no fun. One courtesy star for the costumes which are amazing."
"Feb 26, 2012",4,"Really enjoyed this, 3D is fab with the special effects in this movie"
"Feb 26, 2012",3,I thought the 3D effects would have been better.
"Feb 26, 2012",1.5,DciDment 7 3D ne sert à rien si ce n'est à vous donner l'impression d'avoir la myxomatose
"Feb 26, 2012",2,"Besides that racing scene, it's lame."
"Feb 26, 2012",1,"as with the original 2D film, this should never have been made. don't blame jar jar - blame the greed of one GL."
"Feb 26, 2012",2,The worst in the saga. Jar Jar Binks is the most racists character in cinema since Mamie.
"Feb 26, 2012",3,"Jar Jar Binks in 3D, sure whatever. The movie is worth watching again for the special cameos throughout and the fight sequences in 3D."
"Feb 25, 2012",5,"Anyone who doesn't appreciate this movie is blind............ Great action, a great soundtrack, and a great story. Maul Lives!"
"Feb 25, 2012",3.5,"Even though it's not the best Star Wars movie I believe it's not the worst nor a poor movie.

Yes, Jar Jar Binks is annoying. Yes, Jake Lloyd doesn't deliver. But we're forgetting the acting of other people like Liam Neeson (who I think is amazing), Ewan McGregor (who gives a convincing Obi-Wan), Ian McDiarmid and so on.

I could argue about this for hours but my point is that The Phantom Menace doesn't live up to the originals but that it's still a film that's worth watching for any Star Wars fan."
"Feb 25, 2012",3.5,Eh. 3-D not so thrilling
"Feb 25, 2012",3.5,"JarJar Binks was like fingernails on a chalkboard of course but I otherwise enjoyed watching it with my little boy, who was thoroughly entertained.  I have to say though, the 3-D was just lousy: I kept forgetting it was even supposed to be 3-D; and when I took my glasses off to go refill the popcorn, the picture didn't even look blurry without the glasses.  If you're going to re-release a picture based on a gimmick, at least employ the gimmick!"
"Feb 25, 2012",4,"For a non 3D movie converted into 3D, it was excellent!"
"Feb 25, 2012",3,The 3D was not good just made stuff look closer and the actual movie you could have took off the 3D glasses and it would have been almost the same just a bit blured
"Feb 25, 2012",3,"It has its moments but lack of character development, memorable lines and/or what made the original trilogy amazing it absent. Great special effects though.."
"Feb 25, 2012",5,The pod racing scenes are even better in 3D.  As well as the space battle over Naboo.
"Feb 25, 2012",5,If u  saw it in 2D you'll love it in 3D
"Feb 25, 2012",4.5,"Call me crazy, but this is my favorite Star Wars."
"Feb 25, 2012",1,"I am a horrible father for letting taking my kid to watch this.  I led myself to believe it might be better after all these years when watching with a kid in mind, but its as bad as ever."
"Feb 25, 2012",4.5,"I grew up on Star Wars.  Even for all its faults, it was as enjoyable as ever.  Seeing in the theaters again was great.  Excited for 2, 3 in 3D will be amazing.  4-6 will be something I have been waiting for years for."
"Feb 25, 2012",3,3d version sucked movie to long 3 stars only because its starwars
"Feb 25, 2012",5,Wait. isn't this like a 3-D version of a movie that has already been seen? Then why the hate from the critics? ha!
"Feb 25, 2012",3,"What it boils down to is that this film fails on too many levels to nitpick them all like so many (too many) people on the internet have done. Yes, I've watched fans and casual audiences alike rip this movie limb from limb, analyze every scene, and analyze every problem, perpetually comparing it to the original films and declaring it an unholy abomination.  I prefer to look at the film as it's own entity, at least partially. I have the original films on the back burner of my mind while watching it, not at the forefront.  
I'm not going to attempt to sway anyone into thinking this is a great movie; it isn't. But I don't think it's quite bad enough to turn me away entirely.  I really like the visuals.  From the costumes, make up and visual effects and designs of the aliens and worlds.  The universe has a very real presence; it doesn't have that claustrophobic feel that tends to happen when a film suffers from CGI overload.  I'm pretty sure Attack of the Clones has that problem.  But I think that the CGI looks amazing at points, Jar Jar Binks being the exception.  He's a more complicated character than the dog-faced droids, so that's just expected I guess.  But something tells me his character was unnecessary somehow... anyone else feel that way? But man, that pod race is just exhilarating, as are most of the battle scenes. 
What bothers me the most about this movie is the wooden acting. Someone. Please. Emote! It's not that the actors are acting poorly, it's just that they aren't acting like...anything!  And the casting of that kid was just a misfire on all cylinders.  Shouldn't Darth Vader in child form be, you know, interesting? Have some personality? For all the things wrong with Jar Jar Binks, at least the racially-offensive bastard had some personality.  And honestly, the scrolling text comes up in the beginning and goes on about a trade dispute.  How boring is that?
Bottom line is that the movie is beautiful, but empty.  A disappointment against impossible expectations.  A marvel of production design combined with a man trying to outdo himself by abandoning the things that made his films accidental masterpieces.  I like Phantom Menace on a superficial level, and it being a superficial film, it deserves nothing more."
"Feb 25, 2012",5,"Relived this in 3D, great film.  Still not a fan of Jar Jar...."
"Feb 25, 2012",2.5,This first prequel fails to evoke any of the emotions experienced in the original trilogy. Why should we care about these characters?
"Feb 25, 2012",4,Take it for what it is. Enjoy seeing it on the big screen again. Don't over think it. Just go.
"Feb 25, 2012",1.5,"I know this film was meant as a scene setting for the saga, but JESUS CHRIST it is bad, boring, dull and pointless. Who ever thought that jaja binks (or however his name is spelt) is a good idea?"
"Feb 25, 2012",2.5,"Star wars phantom menace - A massive disappointment upon release, a nonsensical plot, bad effects and wooden acting. 

However in comparison to later prequels this is far better. The main charm of this film is the reality of it, sure the cgi is worse than in 2 and 3, yet there are many more sets used and the camera is not digital which adds a far more real tone to the film wheres the later films would just look like video game cut scenes. And lets not forget that duel at the end, which is the best of the entire saga."
"Feb 25, 2012",5,It was nice to see it :) again
"Feb 25, 2012",4,"the 3D is gorgeous, really makes the movie worth seeing again in theaters!!"
"Feb 25, 2012",5,A Great movie!!!! Critics are stupid...
"Feb 25, 2012",3,"Star Wars is always good.  3D was okay, nothing spectacular."
"Feb 25, 2012",2.5,It's entertaining. In parts. And those parts are few and far between. The film will make you want to hit fast forward everytime Jar Jar Binks or Jake Lloyd are on screen. Which is sadly most of the movie. Liam Neeson and Ewan MacGregor look as if they've wandered on set from a better Star Wars movie that we'd rather be watching.
"Feb 25, 2012",5,It was even better in 3D..pod races and light saber battles were epic!!
"Feb 25, 2012",5,As with all star wars movies it was brilliant and episode one has always been my favourite. The pod race was amazing in 3D! Anyone who hasn't seen star wars needs to go see this!
"Feb 24, 2012",5,Underrated masterpiece.
"Feb 24, 2012",5,"Loved it the first time, and it's just as good now.
Can't say I loved the 3-D though."
"Feb 24, 2012",2.5,"An avid Star Wars' Saga fan said ""Jar-Jar should be left to die in 2D. I hate to pay extra money to be 3Dimentionally annoyed by him""."
"Feb 24, 2012",3.5,The 3D was just right. It added depth without being over the top.
"Feb 24, 2012",4,It was a cool sci-fi action movie but the 4th 5th 6th were better
"Feb 24, 2012",2.5,It's a kids film; judge it on that basis.
"Feb 24, 2012",5,"The force is strong with this movie - went with two droids, but these are not the droids you are looking for!!"
"Feb 24, 2012",1,"Flat characters, story hinging fully on assumed unknowns and an over agressive ad campaign from lucas arts makes me think maybe star wars as a whole has no value outside of letting lucas take all your money and fall back on claims of being an artist despite contributing nothing good to the field of art."
"Feb 24, 2012",3.5,"It's better in 3D and it does get better the more you watch it, mainly due to Liam Neeson. Still not a patch on the originals though."
"Feb 24, 2012",1,This film makes exactly zero sense.
"Feb 24, 2012",5,loved the non 3-d.  saw the 3-d version not impressed with 3-d features.  when not orginially done for 3-d just doesnt jump out at you.
"Feb 24, 2012",5,"3D makes the characters alive but the flaw is this version can be much more better than this. Anyway, ""Star wars"" is still the ""Star wars"".

Just experience the Star Wars in 4DX for the first time, WOOOOOOOW the effects are COOL!!!! The seat shaked like a roller-coaster. The wind blew like a storm which make me shiver. 

Yes, never get disappointed in this epic!!!!"
"Feb 24, 2012",0.5,do not waste your $ on this s...
"Feb 24, 2012",1.5,"Phantom Menace isn't the worst of the Star Wars prequels, but the 3D version incorporates almost no elements of 3D. Converting old movies to 3D doesn't work, so seeing the Phantom Menace in the theater adds little to what I get on my home entertainment system."
"Feb 23, 2012",0.5,Trying to wade through this schlok is terrible.  The plot holes combined with Jar Jar Binks and Anakin really dragged this movie down.  The Red Letter Media review of this movie is more entertaining than the movie itself.
"Feb 23, 2012",4,I was hoping to see the very first one. This one was only ok.
"Feb 23, 2012",4,The sith hits the fan!
"Feb 23, 2012",5,every saga had a begining and this was one of the bigest movies from 1999 and the movie i was realy looking forward when it came out back then and now in its back in theaters and this time its in 3-D and if you forgot the plot of this one well 2 jedi knights played by liam neeson and ewan mcgregor are sent to stop a invasion force taking over a planet and make their queen played by  natalie portmansign a treaty to let them do it how ever they manage to escape but their ship was damaged and had to land on another planet there one of the jedi knights run into a young boy anakin skywalker played by a yong jake lioyd that can help them out how ever a sith lord darth maul played ray park is sent to get the queen and get her back to sign that treaty of theirs  and now the good guy must find a way stop the invasion force and retake their planet i remember when i first saw a preview for this movie back in 1998  and i said that this was going to be my big movie of 1999 and it was my favorite movie that year and i could not wait to see the next 2 prequels directed by george lucas who did 3 other star wars movie including the one that started it all a new hope i know people had problems with this movie when it first came out back in 1999 but i loved it and i throught the 3-D in this one was realy cool and i am looking forward to seeing the other star wars movies in 3-D when they come out in the future so is star wars episode worth seeing in 3-D yes it is and this was the first of many old movies that will be back in theaters in 3-D we will see titanic back in theaters this april in 3-D and i will be seeing that one to when it come back to theaters  if you were a fan of this movie when it first came out back in 1999 like i was then you will want to SEE IT  in 3-D
"Feb 23, 2012",4,I really enjoyed it! I've never seen star wars and now I can't wait to see what happens next!
"Feb 23, 2012",0.5,The 3D sucks and I was quickly reminded how much I hate Jar Jar and Anakin.
"Feb 23, 2012",4,"ESTRADA @ THE MOVIES: STAR WARS EPISODE I 3-D

"Feb 23, 2012",2.5,George lucas has lost his mind when making this. Who wants an annoying sea cretire in a movie
"Feb 23, 2012",1,After watching the Plinket reviews I don't think I will ever watch this movie again even if its on 9000 dimensions
"Feb 23, 2012",2.5,Jar Jar Binks is such an amazingly brilliant character
"Feb 23, 2012",3,"Not really worth seeing in 3D. Enjoyed the movie, but the effects really didn't add what I was expecting."
"Feb 23, 2012",5,Seen this film before at home but the 3D version on the big screen is just great. Saw and heard bits I missed before and the kids were transfixed the whole time!
"Feb 23, 2012",4,this is the famous film of the great saga. watched 3d and better than 2d in 1999 - 12 years ago.
"Feb 23, 2012",1.5,"I have been a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy since I was a very young child.  I have even delved into some of the novels because I enjoy the Star Wars universe so much.  I'm sure there were other people that were anticipating this movie more than I was, but I was certainly above average in excitement.  Now it's easy, perhaps even fashionable, to say that this movie crushed all my expectations.  I mean that's the popular opinion nowadays, right?  But the first time I saw this prequel I must admit I overlooked its flaws and tried to love it for what it is.

The thing that this episode gets right is that it has a few great action sequences, including a battle on 4 different fronts as the climax.  Also they kept some silly slapstick humor which, although annoying to some adults, helps draw in the younger viewers.  However the action sequences lose their magic after the first viewing, and you are left realizing that when you look past those few good scenes this is a really bad film.  Jar-Jar Binks has become the scapegoat, but even if you completely edit him out of the movie, you are still left with  a myriad of problems.  For starters that dialogue is wooden and doesn't feel natural at all.  And Lucas did a brilliant job of hiring actors who could deliver the lines as awkwardly as they were written.

One of the brilliant things about the original Star Wars films is that they never left the action for too long.  However in this movie they have so much plot exposition they want to cram in there, you can go 30 minutes without anything exciting happening.  Perhaps this would be excusable if the plot made any sense but, since the plot sounds like some stream-of-consciousness thing that Lucas just threw together in order to have reasons for the action sequences, you can't help getting annoyed.  And, good grief does it drag on.  Lucas needed an editor, because this could be an entertaining 100 minute movie, but at 131 minutes it's interminable.  Oh and, just to be clear, shifting it into 3-D doesn't magically make a bad movie good.  While the 3-D did make some of the action look even more intense (like the podrace) it didn't make a big enough impact to change my opinion of the film.  I'll probably still watch this movie from time to time because it's Star Wars and it has a few great scenes, but I sometimes wish this movie was never made."
"Feb 23, 2012",4,"always good, 3D was cool"
"Feb 23, 2012",4,"Still a good movie, but not overly impressed with the 3D effects."
"Feb 23, 2012",4,Already seen it what's the point in paying again to go see it in 3D
"Feb 23, 2012",3,"The worst of the 6, but still Star Wars..."
"Feb 22, 2012",5,Want to see this...leis go!!
"Feb 22, 2012",2.5,I watched the trailer and was basically like fuck this shit and then I watched the movie...Seriously? If your gonna bring star wars back at least make a good film about it!
"Feb 22, 2012",3.5,"Say what you want, the Phantom Menace has some phenomenal elements, from the pod-race to Darth Maul, and this coupled with an HD upgrade and top-notch 3d makes for the absolute best way to see Star Wars. I can't wait for the rest of them."
"Feb 22, 2012",1,"It may have been twelve years ago when I saw the film on opening night, but my disgust remains fresh. The story lacked flesh and interest. Mysticism of the force was removed. But Jake Lloyd and Jar Jar were the film's largest cyanide pills."
"Feb 22, 2012",3,Menonton 3D. Jalan cerita masih sama. Efek 3D yang ketara adalah bahagian subtitle sahaja. Tunggu untuk episod 2 pula.
"Feb 22, 2012",4,what 3D?? Love the movie but the 3D Was terrible!
"Feb 22, 2012",5,"The 3D was very good, better than other 3D I seen."
"Feb 22, 2012",0.5,"The 3-D conversion is almost as pointless as this chapter in the Star Wars saga. For what Lucas himself has called high-budget B-Movies, extra care was taken to ensure that the 3-D wasn't ""gimmicky"" where things pop out of the screen (which is the only reason anyone goes to a 3-D movie...ever).  So instead we're treated to images with lots of depth behind them taking you further away from a movie you barely wanted to watch to begin with.  The only real improvement to Episode 1 was that shitty sideburns puppet Yoda was replaced by the CG version.  It's a testament to how crappy the whole experience is that the one thing I was thankful for was the CG replacement of a practical effect.  Seeing this film again only solidified my thinking that this movie was basically tacked on to cash in on the family audience before shit got real in Episode 2 and 3.  A more effective start point for Episode 1 would have been it's climax, opening with Qui Gon Jinn's death in the lightsaber battle. No Pod Race, minimal Li'l Vader and no fucking Jar Jar.  Jar Jar Binks...yeah. One of the few things in the world that fully lives up to the hate-hype around it.  See him again, on the big screen in 3-D and you'll realize that however you reacted to him upon first viewing, you weren't being harsh enough.  Still, as I watched him Amos and amble his way through the film I was reminded of just how much credit I gave Lucas the first time around.  I was certain that this annoying character would later represent the final tether to Anakin Skywalker's childhood and would show just how lost he'd become when he literally cut that tie by killing Jar Jar in Episode 3.  Sure slaughtering unseen Sand People families is dark, but Anakin Killing Jar Jar would have packed more of a dramatic punch.  That's the kind of choice that wasn't made that instead shows just how lost Lucas has become.  This film will serve as a cautionary tale to all artists in the future.  This is what happens when you aren't hungry anymore and people have stopped saying ""No"" to you altogether."
"Feb 22, 2012",3,"Resaw this in its 3D version, which gave it a boost visaully. It's still somewhat dissapointing, but my eight year old son was jumping up and down in his seat all throught the movie, so I guess it is right for the target audience."
"Feb 22, 2012",5,"I give it 5 stars because I love this movie, but the theater sucked at Az mills the glasses were too dark which messed up the 3D"
"Feb 22, 2012",4,"Jar Jar Binks is the worst character Mr. Lucas ever created and almost ruined the film, but it's still Star Wars...in 3D"
"Feb 22, 2012",1,Not sure you would go see this - been out on theatres and on DVD - and then blue ray DVD - think about taking 1 good idea and milking it - way to go George
"Feb 22, 2012",4,"Still the same movie, but many of the 3D scenes were great, especially the Duel of the Fates and space battle."
"Feb 22, 2012",0.5,"To love Star Wars is to forget about this movie.  Sure, it's 3D, but Lucas didn't digitally enhance the acting, directing, and plot enough to watch this a 2nd time.  This is a B Movie at best.

Note, I've seen the originals 30+ times.  I've seen this movie 1 time. So sad."
"Feb 22, 2012",2,"Disappointing return to the Star wars universe. Plenty of quality acting and big screen entertainment but lacked the humour of the earlier films and took itself far, far too seriously. Some people list Jedi as their religion on the census, this film will be fine for them. For the rest of us it was a disappointment"
"Feb 22, 2012",1.5,"Total mess on the screen and lack of emotions ruins Episode 1. Clunky plot, flat characters, Jar Jar Binks and WTF Amidala's wardrobe are evidendces of bad Lucas direction that turn his own opus magnum into a shit. Phantom Menace is biggest disappointing movie in modern history of cinema and, for Lucas lucky, did not put a bad name on Classic Trilogy."
"Feb 22, 2012",4,"Great to get a chance to see classics like this one on the bug screen again. With the newer Starwars movies the sound is a personal favorite of mine and there's nothing like getting to enjoy it once again through a mighty theatre sound system.

As far as the 3D, I have to say it felt VERY subtle and minimalistic. It certainly didn't take anything away from the experience, but I'm not sure how much I really thought it added either (and I'm normally a pretty big fan of 3D)."
"Feb 22, 2012",4,"Anytime any Star Wars film is re-released in the Theater it is a must see. I enjoyed this much more the second time around. The 3-D was alright but the Pod race was cool to see again on the big screen, My kids loved it seeing it on the big screen for the first time, after all isn't that who it was meant for first!"
"Feb 22, 2012",5,"Great to see this film in the cinema again. One of the best Star Wars films, subject to a lot of haters unfortunately."
"Feb 22, 2012",3,Wasn't a big fan of this episode but much better in 3D
"Feb 22, 2012",4.5,3d plus extra footage.  3d does not add much
"Feb 21, 2012",5,"i loved this funxxinng movie, it gave me inspiration and shows that all movies should now be in 3D, i would love that :D plus to make it better they should of had a scene of Mila Kunis eating out Natalie Portman. now who wouldnt like to see that in 3D"
"Feb 21, 2012",3.5,"The lack of a strong character development was excusable in 1977 due to the then brilliant visual effects which changed cinema. However, the same can't be said for this 1999 film. While the special effects were acceptable, the plot was very average and the acting was generally mediocre."
"Feb 21, 2012",3,"The 3D made it a bit better than what it was, but not by much, it remains a slow start to a great series."
"Feb 21, 2012",2.5,"With any re-release, George Lucas has added small scenes to the movie along with the 3D technology to try to boost the overall quality of the film. This works with more detailed scenes like the pod races,  the Mos Isley cityscape, and the planet of Coresent. However, other scenes such as Naboo's overall planetary scaling and Anakin's face in the Coresent scene where he is requesting Padme are ruined. If Lucas had spent a bit more time working on this re-release, then little problems like these might not have been seen, otherwise it could have simply been a result of translating a film that wasn't shot with 3D cameras into 3D."
"Feb 21, 2012",3.5,"Although the Star Wars geek in me will always enjoy a movie such as this one, there isn't a review long enough for me to write that perfectly describes the disdain I feel toward the new trilogy in its entirety. If you are a Star Wars fan, I would definitely recommend seeing it. The ""Duel of the Fates"" scene is as amazing as the space battle and the dive to Gungan City in intense eye-popping 3D. If you are a movie goer looking for something fun to watch and have no emotional bond to Star Wars whatsoever, Jar Jar alone is reason enough to hate it."
"Feb 21, 2012",2,Just google 'star wars plinkett review' if you want to know why 2 and a half stars is generous.
"Feb 21, 2012",2.5,Eh. That pod racing video game based off of this movie was way better than the movie itself.
"Feb 21, 2012",1,Truly the 3D did nothing to improve this terrible travesty.
"Feb 21, 2012",5,Incredible movie made even better by 3D
"Feb 21, 2012",3.5,"Maddie - it was a pretty good show. It's a classic, so it's kinda hard not to like it! I liked the storyline, and I liked the light sabers! I honestly don't think that the 3-D would have been any different than a regular 2-D, if there was one in theaters. 

Daddy - I am a Star Wars fan, but must say that 3D doesn't add much to the movie. The pod race however was cool in 3D. Jar Jar Binks still needs to go whether in 2D OR 3D! May the force be with you!"
"Feb 21, 2012",0.5,"Man... did that movie suck.  No chemistry or direction at all.  The Jedis are like a bad hapless comedy team.  Dark Maul, who we thought would be so fearsome, was under utilized and reduced to an after thought.  No way I would pay to see that drivel ."
"Feb 21, 2012",2,A big colorful turd.
"Feb 21, 2012",0.5,www.redlettermedia.com. That's all.
"Feb 21, 2012",2.5,"The first and last time I saw Episode 1 was a midnight showing when it opened in 1999. Though the movie is still not great, it is better than I recalled. Jar Jar is still an awful character and I have to believe that while in set everyone must have known it, but no one told Lucas. Aside from that, the acting is surprisingly good and much better than the dialog itself. I'd forgotten how good the Jedi battle at the end was and the score during that part is brilliant; it has been stuck in my head.

As for the 3D, it's surprising subtle. Lucas and company could have really gone overboard, but instead they just mildly tweaked things."
"Feb 21, 2012",2.5,"A lot of talking and politics to get to a few killer scenes.  But when you get there, those scenes are unreal.  The 3D processing turned out really well, and Yoda has never looked better! Worth the ticket price to see him alone.  I'm actually excited for the re-release of Ep 2 and 3 in 3D as well."
"Feb 21, 2012",2.5,"The original trilogy is SOOOO much better. The prequels eh it has its moments of good stuff, but the rest, you know what I am talking about."
"Feb 21, 2012",4,"The 3d had some good and some okay points. The podracing scene, space scenes, darth sidious and the gungans are the best 3d sections. Its still a classic."
"Feb 21, 2012",1.5,"Not my favorite, but once you get past Jar Jar, it's all right. We have no idea how many corporations are kind of like the Trade Federation, minus an army of battle droids"
"Feb 21, 2012",3,I'd give this a higher rating if Jar Jar was the one severed in half instead of Darth Maul.
"Feb 21, 2012",5,I liked it. I went to see it on my 15th birthday celebration and it was good!
"Feb 21, 2012",4,Great to see at the Imax. Just so happy to see a Star Wars film bk in the cinemas.
"Feb 21, 2012",4,"Que se puede decir, a pesar de ser la mas flojita de la saga es un sentimiento muy grande haberla revivido despues de 13 años en el cine y en 3D. Las mejores escenas en 3D sin dudas la carrera de podracers y La batalla final. Esperemos que saquen toda la saga convertida al 3D para seguir disfrutando de la obra cumbre de George Lucas, sin lugar a dudas un autentico visionario."
"Feb 21, 2012",3.5,Stunning Re-Release of An Epic Science Fiction Masterpiece That Started A Crazed Nerd Film Cult.
"Feb 21, 2012",3,"Not worth seeing in 3D. Overall, a slow movie with lots of talking and negotiating. The saga only improves from here."
"Feb 21, 2012",4,"Almost every review I have seen is criticizing the movie for the same flaws it had when it was originally released.  This seems bizarre because I don't think there are many people seeing this movie for the first time now in 3D.  I will therefore only comment on the features unique to this release.  The 3D rendering is done very well, what else would you expect from Lucas.  The pod racing and Naboo starfighter scenes are particularly impressive.  So if you are a fan of the franchise, and like me think that while Ep. I was disappointing it was still entertaining, I would definitely recommend this movie.  I have not seen a Star Wars movie in theaters in almost 7 years, this movie in theaters in almost 13 years, and I have never seen a Star Wars movie in 3D.  Any fan of the franchise should enjoy an opportunity to see a Star Wars movie in theaters in 3D."
"Feb 21, 2012",2,"I've been told this was a bad Star Wars movie to begin on. most of the aliens were lame and actually seemed kind of racist ... also, Jar Jar was one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen on screen. and the worstt part!? the 2 best characers in the movie die! A few good things:Liam Neeson and the princesses awesome outfits and hair..."
"Feb 21, 2012",0.5,"Shelden wanted to see it on the big screen in 3D.  Glad I only wasted money on the 2 of us.  Aside from this being my least favorite SW's episode, I was willing to give the new FX a shot.  Well, the 3D conversion was utterly horrid (pod racing was decent).  And perhaps it was the theater's fault but the audio was even worse.  Sounded monaural most of the time."
"Feb 21, 2012",1.5,"Of course, Star Wars (all episodes) is a great series. But the the 3D version of episode 1 is awful. Most of the movie is so blurry that it makes the experience unenjoyable. Only the figures in the very front of a scene are relatively clear. Everything else is blurry. And I don't mean just a bit fuzzy. I mean really blurry."
"Feb 21, 2012",3.5,"After seeing over 1000 films between the first time I saw Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and now, I can give a professional review.
As much as I loved Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace as a kid, I was able to isolate a lot of the issues that others picked up on.
The script in this film is rather poor. It seems rushed, cliche and and doesent support it's actors with lines that can give them much credibility, especially Jake Lloyd whose limitations as an actor and the poor writing of young Anakin Skywalker's lines result in a terrible characterisation of the figure that one day turns into Darth Vader. Certain lines that you can pick off are when something as simple as a transmission disruption leads Sio Bibble to make an assumption that Naboo is under invasion. That, and when Nute Gunray goes to the effort of ensuring that his blockade of Naboo is perfectly legal even though the dialogue clarifying it is out of place. The script is the weakest in the Star Wars series, and the more the characters talk, the more you'll notice it.
And the motivations for the characters are pathetic. Since Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace begins square at the start of the galactic war, it assumes that the trade federation would be willing to wage war on an entire planet due to issues relating to shipping. It's almost as pathetic as the time that Michael Bay claimed the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour solely because the Americans cut off their supply of oil. At least this one is fictional, but it's still senseless.
Also, Jar Jar Binks is George Lucas' worst creation and the single worst character in science fiction film history, and when I day it's George Lucas' worst creation that includes the Star Wars Holiday Special. Maybe when you're 8 or younger he seems funny, but looking back he just makes the film he is the most annoying and vile creature from before Justin Bieber's debut. He's one of the worst screen presences ever to appear in a film, and the second worst of all time since John Leguizamo in Spawn. George Lucas managed to created an entire species that are unlikeable, the Gungans. If any character were to kill them based on their dislike of the Gungan species, it wouldn't be racist. It would be an act of mercy for the rest of the universe.
And like too many people have pointed out, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace defies its roots of being a combination of western elements with eastern elements and science fiction roots, and instead is just a hell of a lot of excessive talking about the political universe in a galaxy far far away. Star Wars is meant to be fun, not an exam lecture like Lions for Lambs was. People don't want politics, they want adventure, and George Lucas got too lost in attempting excessively to explain the universe that he forgot to make it a fun one, so his direction in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is far from his best.

However, this isn't enough to give the film a bad name. Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace  boasts an amazing effort everyone put into the film really shows on screen. For example:
George Lucas takes every chance to display the breakthrough in CGI technology that he is able to make all over again, and even stronger this time. The visual effects are immaculate, with the look of the spaceships, the underwater universe of Gunga city and the exceptional podracing sequence being all breakthrough moments in visual effects history. The production design, costumes, makeup and cinematography are all very impressive too. Thanks to this, the aesthetic appearance of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is absolutely flawless and the visual experience is essentially unbeatable by films of its time. How The Matrix won the Best Visual Effects Academy Award is very far beyond me. The races, the wars and the space battles impress me every time, but greatest scene of all is the lightsaber battle at the climatic finale of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The huge amount of training that the three actors underwent is amazing and the choreography is flawless. The moment that Obi Wan Kenobi and Qui Gonn Jinn battle Darth Maul for the last time is one of the most unforgettable moments in action movie history, and stands out so well as one of the most memorable images in cinematic history. My dad especially loved it since he grew up with the original Star Wars trilogy and has seen it develop, so it impresses the old and the young. Anyone wanting some amazing action can look no further than Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. All of the action is great and it's strongly choreographed so finding a dull moment in it is a real challenge, particularly because once it kicks off its easy to pick up on the theme of adventure.
And the cast, while evoking a mixed response in certain areas, is consistently fairly strong.
Like I said before, Jake Lloyd doesn't do much of a good job, but he's a young actor with a role too big for him put on his shoulders. He just isn't right for the part and his voice even becomes annoying because it maintains a certain whiny tone.
Keira Knightly doesn't really impress anyone either because she maintains the same basic tone of voice all the time in every situation and it becomes repetitive and ineffective.
Also, Ahmed Best is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life, and it's not just me saying that. 

Liam Neeson, although clearly not at his best due to not working strongly alongside George Lucas' directional style, absolutely spearheads the role of Qui Gonn Jinn. He has the perfect charisma of a Jedi Master since he has an immaculate sense of wisdom conveyed through his physicality and line delivery straight from the heart. He finds the perfect balance between being a wise hero and being a courageous warrior, and his fight scene at the end is completely loaded with his skills for action. Liam Neeson reminds us what it is to be a hero in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.
Ewan McGregor has a difficult role, stepping into the shoes of the role that scored veteran actor Alec Guiness an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting actor. Yet he just nails it. He separates himself from his role in Trainspotting, he nails the physical characteristics of Obi Wan Kenobi perfectly and he delivers a strongly charismatic line delivery which has a shining spirit in him, even when he has poor lines to deliver. In my youth, Ewan McGregor was my hero for his role as Obi Wan Kenobi, and to this day that still lives on.
I grew up having Natalie Portman as a favourite actress solely because of her role in the Star Wars universe. And although her talents hadn't fully blossomed by Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, she does have a strength for developing chemistry with other actors which characterises her as a caring figure and an involved one, and that's what strengthens the characterisation of Padme Amidala for the screen.
Ian McDiarmid and Terrence Stamp both made strong chancellors, and Hugh Quarshie had a great strength which he supplied to the role of Captain Panaka.
Samuel L. Jackson is too perfectly a genial presence because the intense ferocity in his eyes and the idea that he is an incredibly strong figure makes him the perfect choice for Jedi Master Mace Windu.
Lastly, Ray Park was really boss as Darth Maul, because with the demonic Zabrak face and eyes of a lost soul he is set up as a warrior of darkness, and his flawless battle skill makes for an incredible antagonist and an unforgettable image.
If I had to sit here and go through all the characters from the Star Wars universe I loved, ranging from Jedi Master Ki-Adi Mundi to Jedi Master Yoda and all the other masters, then I would have a mile-long review. Just let it be known that I liked practically all the characters with the exception of any Gungan and their tyrannical fool Jar Jar Binks.
The last thing to praise is that thanks to John Williams, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace has an unforgettable intense musical score which sets a fire off in my heart every time I hear it. It's incredibly composed and so strongly memorable, and I would run out of words if I had to sit here and describe its perfection. I'll summarise by saying its one of the greatest in cinematic history.

It's been six years since I last saw this film on VHS. Now, I saw it in 3D on the big screen, and it awoke the kid in me that was obsessed with star wars and that always wanted to be a Jedi. And while Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is not the greatest of the saga like I once believe it was, it's still incredibly impressive. George Lucas' direction isn't his finest, but it is in fact strong enough for viewers to walk away mesmerised."
"Feb 20, 2012",3,"my least favorite of the series, the little kid anakin can not act. the story was good though, and natalie portman is reason enough to watch anything shes in."
"Feb 20, 2012",3,Think of this movie as a terrible but pretty introduction for this generation of kids  Not a fan of this one. I do LOVE Star Wars as a whole. My daughter loves Star Wars even more so.
"Feb 20, 2012",4,"Still EP1. But adding the digitized Yoda and removing the puppet was a great improvement. The 3D up conversion is the best I have ever seen. If you are a Star Wars fan it's worth the money, if not keep your opinions of the movie to your selves. We all already know this episode was made to attract young kids to the story line, It still achieves that from the reactions of the 8 yr old that sat behind me seeing it for the first time. There are some added shots here and there but not enough to change the flow of the movie. Overall movie experience in 3D was great. It's still my least favorite of the six films, but it's still Star Wars on the big screen! See it before you never get to see it on the big screen again."
"Feb 20, 2012",2,"I've decided to watch all of the Star Wars films in chronological order as if I am new to the franchise. When I was younger I loved these films, but I had different tastes back then. As a 18 year old that is a fan of several different genres of film, I can honestly say that cool lightsaber duels and laser blasters are not enough to make up for the film's underdeveloped characters, poor dialogue, and story progression. All the pieces to make this film awesome were on the table, but they didn't come together correctly."
"Feb 20, 2012",3.5,Slowest of the 3 but still good
"Feb 20, 2012",5,THIS WAS AWSOME!!!!!!!
"Feb 20, 2012",4,I live this and all star wars movies. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the 3D was a waste. It hardly made any difference at all. Even when Anakin blew up the ship at end end it looked like plain old 2D. I would have rather just seen a 2D showing and saved a few bucks.
"Feb 20, 2012",2.5,"""I've got to be honest with everyone, this is the most disappointing 'Star Wars' film I have ever seen in my life. However there are fans of the saga who turned out to like this prequel and you know what, that's fine. I have no problem with that and as a 'Star Wars' fan I can respect that. There are a few pros I can name for this film which are Darth Maul, the Pod Racing sequence, the score from John Williams, some of the visual effects, and of course Liam Neeson in this film. The cons of this film, EVERYTHING including the most stupidest and boring plot and of course, Jar Jar Binks. I mean really George? HE'S supposed to be the next Chewbacca? Ugh."""
"Feb 20, 2012",1.5,"Being this film was originally shot in a digital format, which I expected to look great, was very disappointed in the video quality.  Also since George Lucas has a thing against IMAX viewing this film in a standard theater does not do this film justice.  Although I would have to disagree with most people about the film itself it was nice to see it on the big screen.

But since it's playing in IMAX it's not worth seeing, and won't see the rest of them.

Disappointed Kevin"
"Feb 20, 2012",3.5,"The 3D in this movie wasn't the best or worst, but it was enjoyable to revisit the Star Wars universe again."
"Feb 20, 2012",3.5,"I'll give it a little credit, the podrace was excellent in 3D."
"Feb 20, 2012",0.5,Terrible waste of time!
"Feb 20, 2012",5,"Still may not be anything it the league of the first 3 films but still good  and exiting build up for kids today as it is,virtually,the beginning ..."
"Feb 20, 2012",4,HÚN ER AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!
"Feb 20, 2012",3,"I'm giving this three stars for pure entertainment value.  The pod race and final lightsaber duel are the two best sequences in the new trilogy, and make this the most tolerable of the prequels."
"Feb 20, 2012",1.5,"Love Star Wars, but really, this is the worst one. What was Lucas thinking with Jar Jar? Most annoying movie character of all time."
"Feb 20, 2012",3.5,"It isn't the best movie in the world, but Star Wars was pretty epic in 3D!!"
"Feb 20, 2012",3.5,I liked it but they need to make 3D movies that really came out at you.
"Feb 20, 2012",2,Good for seven-year-olds. Bad for everyone else. The only thing that makes it watchable is how bad-ass Darth Maul is. I detest Jar-Jar Binks.
"Feb 20, 2012",3,3D version was okay but not extremely impressive
"Feb 20, 2012",0.5,"George Lucas, what are you doing?"
"Feb 20, 2012",2.5,3D was not that impressive!  Weakest of the Star Wars movies!
"Feb 20, 2012",2.5,Wasn't really 3D only had a couple scenes that were real 3D everythang else was basically background 3D
"Feb 20, 2012",5,This movie seemed even better 13 years later
"Feb 20, 2012",5,"Don't care about 3D, but the movie is good."
"Feb 19, 2012",3.5,"The movie is only worth for watching Star Wars again in theathers.
3D effects were bad for most parts as in some they just looked like a terribly executed green screen, also The Phantom Menace is not like the old school Star Wars but it makes good with the action scenes, i think it is not as bad as most people say and it is entertaining to watch, just give it a try but don't expect a masterpiece"
"Feb 19, 2012",1,Din respect pt domnul Lucas
"Feb 19, 2012",3,Watched it with Adam this weekend. Loved the pod race! L
"Feb 19, 2012",4,I dont understand why so many people hated on this movie. jar jar binks wasnt that annoying and the phantom menace had to be told so the series was completed. its ashame darth maul didnt last longer or get more screen time. his appearance literally represents everything the sith is. and its dumb that dooku lasted thru 2 movies but maul only got one.
"Feb 19, 2012",3,At least there's podracing...
"Feb 19, 2012",2.5,"Still had Jar Jar... Pod Racing, Space Combat and Light Sabre Duels cool in 3D.  Didn't change the original bad acting, script and directing...  Funny how I see more flaws in this movie the more I see it."
"Feb 19, 2012",3.5,It's the same movie with the same laughably bad acting. Now it just has some nice 3D to emphasize the nice visuals.
"Feb 19, 2012",3,"If you see this movie, you have to see it with kids.  When you see the reaction of their little faces, suddenly all of Jar Jar's antics and the flat plot line will make sense."
"Feb 19, 2012",4,Took the boy 3D was awesome
"Feb 19, 2012",2.5,3D added nothing to this movie.
"Feb 19, 2012",1,"Cool in brothers taste but not cool in sisters taste!"""
"Feb 19, 2012",1.5,nonononononononononononononononononono. that's all I have to say about that. and this is coming from a number one star war fan. but I do love Qui-Gon Jinn that's why it gets a star.
"Feb 19, 2012",3,3 stars only cause I love star wars. But I've seen Episode 1 some many times. It wasnt special. Even in 3D
"Feb 19, 2012",4.5,"The first Star Wars film I ever saw was number 5, The Empire Strikes back.  At the time, I was 12, and I had NO idea what the movie was about.  The first time I saw THIS movie, I was slightly older, and the last person to use the VHS didn't rewind, so I saw the movie completely out of order.

Now, the first Star Wars was a revolutionary spectacle for the big screen.  Never before had it been done.  Things like a first-person perspective of flying through the Death Star's trench, or having a hoard of stormtroopers fire at the screen, were just dazzling to watch.  However, I was not alive yet to see such magnificence.

What is happening essentially is an opportunity to get the feel that we could have felt had we been born in the sixties.  We get to see these masterfully crafted scenes and sequences through new eyes; and maybe we get a taste of what the buzz was about in 1977.

I enjoyed seeing it in 3D, and to see it all the way through from beginning to end was very satisfying.  The pod race and space flying sequences were exhilarating, as were the lightsaber fights.  Seeing this saga again in 3D will be as close as our generation will ever get to seeing Star Wars for the first time in 1977."
"Feb 19, 2012",2,"Seeing Star Wars on the big screen was fun for me once, but when seeing Episode 1 in 3D is just really disappointing, because for that, I have learned my lesson  that 3D is all brand marketing, but of course the hard way."
"Feb 19, 2012",1.5,"I haven't seen this in a long time and seeing it again made me wonder why I ever liked it. The story is bland and uninteresting and it only made an impact when you got to the final act with Darth Maul fighting Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. The thing that bothered me was the overall terrible 3D conversion job, panning shots became blurry and there wasn't much depth to the 3D. However the shots in space looked incredible."
"Feb 19, 2012",3,"Was fun 2see again especially with my lil neph (tyler):) had a good time,,but the 3D wasn't that great:("
"Feb 19, 2012",2.5,"I consider myself a Star Wars fan. Yet this milking has to be stopped. The cow has a certain amount of milk that it can give with one milking, yet Lucas&amp;Co. try hard enough to get some more. Instead it'll be really great to see another instalment of the series. ;)"
"Feb 19, 2012",4,The 3D made it better. A-
"Feb 19, 2012",3,3D of this movie must have been better.
"Feb 19, 2012",4,"I haven't seen a Star Wars movie since Revenge of the Sith (2005) and watching the opening credits roll on screen was exciting as it was disappointing. Disappointing knowing that it wasn't a new Star Wars movie. But, the movie felt fresh and the 3D was better than most movies that claim the 3D effects are ""state of the art"". I didn't like the additional scenes that were added to the movie, it didn't feel original. And, criticize me as you may but, Jar Jar was prolly the biggest downer of the movie. Worst. Character. Ever. But Darth Maul makes up for the lame."
"Feb 19, 2012",5,"Qué decirles...soy un fan, no un crítico...al menos en ESTA saga!"
"Feb 19, 2012",2.5,"The special effects are still amazing, aside from the new scenes added since the original theatrical cut, which stand out like a sore thumb.
The 3D is disappointing, not nearly as deep or exciting as other 3D releases."
"Feb 19, 2012",3,"I love the saga, and want to see them all in 3D.  Seen this and, although i enjoyed it, the 3D was not all that spectacular.  Movie probably least favorite of them all, but hey...it's ""Star Wars""!"
"Feb 19, 2012",2,Worst prequel with the most annoying characters.
"Feb 19, 2012",1.5,Pour les scènes avec Dark Maul et la course de pods. Le personnage de Jar-Jar Binks est vraiment insupportable. Et la 3D n'apporte rien.
"Feb 19, 2012",3.5,"I don't know if it's maturity, 3d or nostalgia, but there was a magic in revisiting this movie on the big screen that I didn't get the first two times I watched it.

I left the theater thinking ""okay I rather enjoyed that"" and I'm looking forward to the next re-release"
"Feb 19, 2012",5,its the same classic star wars
"Feb 19, 2012",4.5,This is a great movie. People only criticize this film for a few characters and that shouldn't be enough to make it a terrible movie.
"Feb 19, 2012",2.5,"While the 3D transfer does not add anything to the film, it's interesting to see the film on the big screen. However, the script adds unnecessary details to the plot and the film drags down in several places, particularly in the beginning. I'm sure more hardcore fans appreciate the information (and apparently there are a few new additions in places like the pod race), but it's almost more helpful to browse the WIkipedia entry before seeing the movie than to try and puzzle through the expository scenes."
"Feb 19, 2012",3.5,"We are all aware that Jar-Jar Binks and young Anakin leave a bitter after taste. I wasn't thrilled to go see The Phantom Menace in 3D.  But the instant the 20th Century Fox theme came up and Episode 1: The Phantom Menace rolled on the screen I was taken back, for a moment, to my childhood viewings of Star Wars. That alone made it worth it. Honestly, it's not a horrible film.  Just another chapter in a universe I love to visit. There are parts of this movie that are done extremely well and others that miss the mark by a star system but Lucas did what he desired. He brought a whole new generation into the Star Wars fold. Seeing it again on the big screen is a treat.

Oh, and the 3D, as expected, did not add much... because who wants to see Jar-Jar in 3D. (Side-note: my oldest daughter, who saw Episode 1 as a child said to me, ""How did I not realize Jar-Jar was so irritating when I was a kid."" That's the magic of Lucas."
"Feb 19, 2012",4,"It was really good to see this on the big screen again. The 3D didn't add much to the movie, though they did a good job of it, but these were made to be seen in the theater and it was worth the price of admission to see it that way again. Yes, the movie itself has flaws. Yes, JarJar was over-the-top. But the flaws were not as distracting as I had remembered, and the total experience was great. And by the way: there were kids there who could not reasonably have seen it in the theater, and THEY were really having a blast!"
"Feb 19, 2012",1,Lucas is the one of the only directors that can make great actors horrible.
"Feb 19, 2012",2,"This movie is not bad but the things that bothered me was the CGI and Jar Jar binks
But the 3-D release wasn't too good the only scene in 3-D that I liked was the pod race scene
B-"
"Feb 19, 2012",3,"Too much exposition and wooden dialogue compromised this film. The only redeeming factors here were the lightsaber battle, the podrace and the political intrigue which could have been engaging if it weren't too long and dragging."
"Feb 19, 2012",3,Tiene algunos de los mejores y peores momentos de la saga. La conversiÃ³n en 3D no es demasiado buena.
"Feb 19, 2012",2.5,"Phantom is a frustrating watch, however there are elements worth admiring: its ambition plot, Williams' score, the art direction, and the iconic duel with Darth Maul."
"Feb 19, 2012",4,With extended pod race new yoda that looks like yoda and pre adain christansn enjoyed it on the big screen . But to make the next one any good they have alot more work on there hands . Long live jarjar
"Feb 19, 2012",4,I'm a fan of Star Wars.  It was good to see it on the big screen again.  The 3-D was okay. The movie wasn't made with 3-D in mind.  It worked a little but most scenes where it would be cool went across the screen rather than at it.
"Feb 19, 2012",4,"I liked it but maybe it's because I saw it in 4D, if you get a chance watch it, it's really cool but I'm not sure if there are any theaters in the US that offer 4D"
"Feb 19, 2012",3.5,3D wasn't much too see.
"Feb 18, 2012",3,"The movie is not the best, but it's also not the worst. Episode I is entertaining to watch despite the cheesy dialogue, and unnecessary scenes. The 3D makes it fun to watch."
"Feb 18, 2012",2,"Better than I remember, but the 3D looks ok but adds little.
The film suffers from a number of awful elements, such as Jar Jar Binks, the acting from most, stupid plot ideas and racist stereotypes. The addition of the commentators for the pod race show that this film is not taking itself seriously enough which is disappointing for fans.
Better than Attack of the Clones, but only just.
Looking forward to Episode IV-VI in 3D. The prequels are just padding."
"Feb 18, 2012",0.5,eeeewwwwwww&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; what a fuck movie is that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! could you make a sex movies that was cool
"Feb 18, 2012",3,"I'd forgotten how much JarJar makes me want to kill everyone (including myself) in the cinema, I'd also forgotten just how crap most of the acting and pretty much all of the dialogue is, but, it's Star Wars, it's the start of a much bigger and better story that is worth hanging around for. If you havnt seen it on the big screen go see it, the 3D adds absolutely nothing though so don't expect great things from it."
"Feb 18, 2012",3,"I guess I expected something new besides the 3D, like some lost footage or something like that."
"Feb 18, 2012",0.5,One of the worst films ever made.
"Feb 18, 2012",1,"It is a pretty bad movie. 3D is not necessary at all, and the time people spent on the trip is more than other stuff happening in the scene. Get my Money BACK!!!"
"Feb 18, 2012",4,"Great start to a classic series. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the set-up for all the future story lines makes it a little slow at times. My only advise if you are going to see it again in 3D, make SURE you ARE seeing the 3D feature, because they are showing it in 2D in some theaters too."
"Feb 18, 2012",2,"Thought that 3D would make the battle scenes and pod-race outstanding, but was let down. Liked the movie in 2d (except for Jar Jar, of course). First 3D movie, don't know about seeing another for the extra premium ticket price."
"Feb 18, 2012",4,Not worth seeing in 3D.
"Feb 18, 2012",2.5,"I have mixed reactions for this film especially for the 3D version. Positives have to do with the acting (especially with Ewan McGregor's performace), fight sequences, and the digitization with yoda. Negatives have to deal with Jar Jar, Anikan as a child, the writing, The disapointment that they didn't take this opportunity to reinstate the Waterfall sequence, and the 3d in general. Between these seven, this basically makes it the same movie that I saw 13 years ago in theaters and I agree with the critics on this one."
"Feb 18, 2012",0.5,Whom does George Lucas hate more? Himself or the audience? Watch this and decide.
"Feb 18, 2012",3,Same movie. Only slightly 3D!!
"Feb 18, 2012",4.5,This movie is bomb. Brought me back to my childhood.
"Feb 18, 2012",3.5,"Sympa a revoir au cine, la 3D ne sers a rien.... Cela reste un Star Wars!"
"Feb 18, 2012",1.5,"What's better than soulless, deprived garbage devoid of substance? Seeing it 3-friggin-D apparently."
"Feb 18, 2012",4,Baby 3D but love the big screen.
"Feb 18, 2012",4,"The film itself may not be very good because of the disappointment behind it but in the cinema it is shown in quite a whole new light and you forget most of the bad behind it and experience the phantom menace differently than ever before. The film itself carries too many sub-plots and they are all clustered together quite badly but the many set pieces and scenes are so incredible. The podrace, the sith v Jedi, the explosions are great to see in 3D and you enjoy the film besides the unlikable characters, Jake Lloyd's quite cheesy acting and clustered plots you will have a great time unless if you can't forgive Lucas for what he made."
"Feb 18, 2012",4,"Jar Jar Binks still sucks and is highly annoying. If they eliminated his character from the first movie completely it wouldve been a lot better. If you havent seen the first movie (like me) then seeing this on the big screen is worth it. The 3D conversion is okay, but its no Avatar. May the force be with you movie goers."
"Feb 18, 2012",1.5,"Yep .. still sucks ... 

3D, though, added a bit more eye candy during the battle scenes."
"Feb 18, 2012",3,not quite as bad as people say has an incredible villain and amazing score unfairly hated
"Feb 18, 2012",1.5,I'm sure if I had not watched the trilogy until being an adult I would be equally as appalled at the dialogue in those films as I am with the new trilogy. This is certainly the worst of the the new ones and there was ZERO added by the supposed 3D. Still enjoyed the fighting with Darth Maul but that was it.
"Feb 18, 2012",5,Natalie Portman OMFG
"Feb 18, 2012",0.5,"I'm not going to give this iteration of TPM a ""real"" star rating, as I'm primarily going to criticize the technology.  TPM is what it is, warts and all, but it's transfer to digital 3D adds absolutely nothing to the film.   This release suffers because it was shot on celluloid.  The only shots which transfer decently are close ups.   The medium and long shots look like grade school dioramas.   I found myself watching the performances, listening closely to the dialogue, concentrating on the editing and trying not to notice how poor the transfer was.   I believe that Episodes 2 and 3 will be better as they were shot digitally, but that really doesn't change anything.   The Saga was not filmed for a gimmick technology, nor was it shot in a pseudo-rotoscope fashion such as Avatar.   The Saga, even the weakest episodes, was grounded by live action actors.  3D is great for Pixar films but falls horribly flat with live action films.   I dread any rerelease of classic films such as Citizen Kane, Gone With The Wind or The Wizard of Oz in 3d.   Hi-Res 1D transfers I can live with, but the use of 3D is deeply cynical.   Using 3D to re-release films is like using glitter to spruce up the Mona Lisa, it's tacky and pointless ... some things just don't need improvement."
"Feb 18, 2012",0.5,"Watched it, embarrassed for George lucus! Should never been done in 3-D , waste of money to see this film AGAIN"
"Feb 18, 2012",3.5,"Ok not too bad, just not much 3D either. Jar Jar Bink as annoying as ever."
"Feb 18, 2012",4,"While the 3D aspect was certainly unnecessary, the nostalgia brought on by the return of Lucas' epic series to the big screen was definitely worth watching."
"Feb 18, 2012",4,Still a great fun ride!
"Feb 18, 2012",3,Is there anyway the can ressurect Darth Maul and kill Jar Jar Binks?
"Feb 18, 2012",5,Only word that comes to mind... AWESOME! ;)
"Feb 18, 2012",4,"Some parts really stood out in 3D such as the opening credits, alien subtitles and the underwater jar jar binks sequence. Just a great sci-fi movie! :)"
"Feb 18, 2012",3.5,Good back story. Some good characters. But overall I think this movie is pretty slow.
"Feb 18, 2012",1,It was Crap then and it's Cap now. Flogging a dead horse. Should have stopped at the first one.!
"Feb 18, 2012",4,"The 3D added to the enjoyment of the experience, but not as much as I had hoped. Converting to the format after the fact can only do so much."
"Feb 18, 2012",0.5,"what 3D? So unnecessary , I like it just fine in 2D. (May be in HD too)"
"Feb 18, 2012",2,"Liam Neeson.

He makes me watch things.  Even bad things."
"Feb 18, 2012",3,"The movie is underrated by comparison to the earlier greats, but if you call it star wars than that is what is expected. Macregor tried to add personality to the later flicks but he was doomed by general direction of the production. Somehow watching real puppets is more compelling than smoothed out graphics, too many scenes feel like a rehearsal walk through instead of living material."
"Feb 17, 2012",3.5,"Awful dialogue aside, the movie remains a mostly fun, nostalgic experience for me (I was 13 when it was released), but the 3D adds absolutely nothing."
"Feb 17, 2012",1,Not worthy to be the beginning of a cult classic!
"Feb 17, 2012",2,"over long, over hyped, over rated"
"Feb 17, 2012",1,I genuinely hated this film with a passion - except the obi wan and Darth Maul scrap. so much so that im not even gonna review it. :(
"Feb 17, 2012",4.5,"4.5/5. Jar Jar aside, this movie has aged well especially in an era of overburden CGI. Lucas made a movie for himself and you Critics are just determined to go MY SANDBOX! And hate on the man for doing what he has earned. FUCK ALL YOU CRITICS. I swear this meter dropped like a fly because it was at 62 and all you want to do is give it a bad rating. You're all so wrapped up in your own hatred and what might've been that you neglect to see what good did come out of it. All you ""critics"" can go straight to hell."
"Feb 17, 2012",0.5,Don't even get me started. This movie is just the headache that keeps giving.
"Feb 17, 2012",2.5,Great when the characters shut up and race and/or fight.
"Feb 17, 2012",2,"This Movie Was Crap Back In '99.

13 Years Later And In 3D Doesn't Get Any Better."
"Feb 17, 2012",5,Siempre es gratificante verla ... Aunque !! Un polÃ­tico que convence con su sonrisa y luego trata de acaparar todos los poderes al lado obscuro ?? Juro que he visto esa trama en otro lado!!
"Feb 17, 2012",5,"Star Wars is epic, this is a reminder of how excellent this Saga is."
"Feb 17, 2012",3.5,"The inclusion of characters like Darth Maul, Jar Jar Binks &amp; Mace Windu, plus the thrilling pod racing scenes makes the Phantom Menance the best installment to Star Wars after its original trilogy."
"Feb 17, 2012",0.5,How could they rerelease this trash?  The old man thought he could do it all.
"Feb 17, 2012",4,Loved it in 3D. Looking forward to the next 5!
"Feb 17, 2012",4,"I don't know anything about the accusations of stiff dialogue and the racism of the Gungans, and even if I did, it wouldn't matter. This is proof that 3D rereleases of movies can work. The picture is clear and deep. There was a little buzzing on the sound (let me know if you had it or if it was just the venue I saw it at). And even after all the complaints, people still turned out for it, just because it's Star Wars."
"Feb 17, 2012",5,I've now seen Episode 1 a total of 11 times (including the original release in 1999) in theaters and I loved it every time.  This was the best 2D conversion I've seen so far.
"Feb 17, 2012",2.5,The second least offensive of the NT.
"Feb 17, 2012",4,"Was really good, even though i've seen it before"
"Feb 17, 2012",2.5,"I love Star Wars, but I thought the 3D hype was a little overrated."
"Feb 17, 2012",3,Has some pretty impressive visual effects and the pod race is definitely exciting....but the script ultimately fails.
"Feb 17, 2012",5,"Of coarse it rocked .....fucken Darth Mual with his two sided lightsabor ,FUCK CHA!"
"Feb 17, 2012",0.5,"As I child, I seemed to have thought this movie was the best ever! My VCR had it on replay yet ten years later, the movie has lost its charm and in 3D, didn't offer anything special from the original. It's a shame, there is so much missed opportunity. The CGI JarJar was incredibly distracting, the original version was just as fine. Unnecessary changes like that were too much to handle."
"Feb 17, 2012",2.5,"This is definitely still not the best Star Wars, but I wouldn't miss the chance to see it on the big screen again. Just like in the 2D version the best part in 3D is the pod racing. Other parts of the film didn't translate to 3D. I still think 3D is over rated but I will be watching all of the SW films in 3D."
"Feb 17, 2012",1,"Faced with the choice of going home and watching Episode 1 again, I really should have just gone home. Instead, I was curious to see if it really is as bad as I remember it is. It's worse."
"Feb 17, 2012",4.5,https://sites.google.com/view/ttbreviews/our-company/star-wars-episode-i---the-phantom-menace
"Feb 17, 2012",3.5,"I agree the story is not the best one of the saga (the worst), but once you are in from of the screen and the Star wars logo appears, follow by episode one... shifting from you to the background in 3D...;...; feeling you are in that Universe for the first time!!, I barely care about the story I am in Naboo, Tattoine,... the podrace... It worth it!! Even CG Yoda looks better,.. Some of the scenes are really good."
"Feb 17, 2012",2.5,"It looked better thanks to the 3D effects, but honestly there was no point in re releasing the film in 3D because only once did the 3D fit the movies special effects."
"Feb 17, 2012",2,After re-watching the original three you realize just how bad the recent three are.
"Feb 17, 2012",1,Yeah a 3D conversion of the worst Star Wars movie.
"Feb 17, 2012",2,"Poor dialog, plot holes galore, forgettable characters, nice effects, excellent musical score."
"Feb 17, 2012",5,One of the worst Star Wars movies but it is still a Star Wars movie.
"Feb 17, 2012",5,Incredible beyond words.
"Feb 17, 2012",2.5,"I loved this film when I was a kid, but even then I knew it could not touch the originals. Looking at it now with it's 3-D upgrade, I can't help thinking, why would you make an unnecessary upgrade to an unnecessary film? The only real saving grace (other than the showdown between the Jedi and the Sith) is that this kicks off the rerelease of all the films. My order of quality: Episode 5, Episode 4, Episode 6, Episode 3, 2, and 1. The fim looks great, but it's bogged down by poor 'child-star' acting, bad writing, and JAR JAR friggin BINKS! Still, it is solid enough to prop up the next installment, which is by far the superior endeavor."
"Feb 17, 2012",3,"The re-release of this Star Wars episode in 3D leaves a lot to be desired. Had this been my first 3D movie, I'd have wondered what all the hype about 3D was! With the creativity and financial backing George Lucas has, I'm shocked at the lack of quality this film holds. Sorry I spent the extra $$ to view this in 3D."
"Feb 17, 2012",3.5,"The Phantom Menace has a good prolog, but I have to say this is very convoluted story, and incidentally grab the characters itself, no one character that memorable. Far from good as Lucas original!!"
"Feb 17, 2012",2,"This film completely lacks the soul,character and greatness of the first 3 films."
"Feb 17, 2012",4,Still not my favorite star wars but loved it in 3D.  With the my boys who have never seen star wars in the theatre.   Can't wait for the rest
"Feb 17, 2012",2.5,jar jar binks..i hope you rot in hell.
"Feb 17, 2012",4,"Awesome movie! Darth Maul is beyond awesome. This film is highly under-rated, and unfairly bashed."
"Feb 17, 2012",4,"I don't care.... I LIKE IT! The 3D wasn't really obvious, which is either good or bad, depending on your preference (I for one don't always need things to come toward my face). The absolute adoration I have for my awesome Podracer 3D glasses may influence by view, so... yeah."
"Feb 16, 2012",1.5,"At least the poster shows Lucas knows what's important... the guy who introduced us to double-lightsabers, Ewan McGregor, and fabulous pod-racery sound editing. Half star for each."
"Feb 16, 2012",1,5 minutes of Empire Strikes Back is far greater than all the prequels combined.  These are some of the worst movies ever created.
"Feb 16, 2012",2,"as science fiction Star Wars suffers from a lack of anything that could be considered remotely insightful about the future, about space, or about the human condition and its relationship to the universe."
"Feb 16, 2012",0.5,"BOOOOO!!!! Love star wars hate this! Awful, horrible, bad, dreadful, terrible, abysmal. Those are the words that come to mind when I think of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. The whole thing is horrible. Darth Maul is okay, but that doesn't make up for the rest of it. Really, the only good thing to come from this is the Pod - Race scene. That was pretty good. But, that is literally it. Other than that, it's bad acting, bad special effects, effing Jar Jar Binks. God, Jar Jar was the worst. You hate him during the whole movie. Really, the whole movie is horrible. It is not underrated, it's overrated and it's already hated. I beg you not to see this, your life will be better if you don't."
"Feb 16, 2012",3.5,"Still the same movie I saw back in 1999, just in 3D...nothing new here. The 3D worked well, but didn't help the plot in any way."
"Feb 16, 2012",2,"The beginning of a weaker prequel trilogy, which struggles with disappointing alien characters, and annoying introduction to Anakin Skywalker, minimal character development and a pointless political angle. Thankfully, Liam Neeson finds some emotion with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, and Darth Maul is as awesome a villain at the series can manage."
"Feb 16, 2012",4.5,"Such a great experience! I know this was not the best of the series but still it made me feel like a kid again. I never got to see the originals in the theater but I sincerely hope they get put into theaters for our generation. Episode one had its moments of greatness and its moments of failure. I for one say the 3D was not that great and well the kid who played Anakin...was horrible. With the one phrase you hear from him over and over (""yippeee"") I cringed up. Then of course Jar Jar could have been voiced differently and so could have his race. Other then that I loved the film and I suggest you all see it at least once...maybe twice!"
"Feb 16, 2012",5,Very kind purely for the franchise.  3D version seen in the cinema!!
"Feb 16, 2012",1,We have the best lightsaber battle in the worst Star Wars movie. Lucas should be punished for the abomination known as Jar Jar Binks.
"Feb 16, 2012",2,"[test]  i'm your father (update to original review of ""young skywalker"")"
"Feb 16, 2012",2,"13 years ago I was hoarse with excitement over this film. I bought walkers crisps just to have some Star Wars pogs and even had a Darth Maul bubblebath! I saw it twice on it's original release and have since bought it on VHS, DVD and more recently on Blu Ray (ok I wanted the originals and the deleted scenes so had to). Half term week and I thought yeah let's go and see it in 3D! The titles and crawl looked amazing in 3 dimensions but....

Seeing it all again on the big screen was quite frankly an ordeal. The rest of first half hour is virtually unwatchable especially the scenes with various racial stereotypes - the Chinese trade federation and the Gungans. I was very distracted by the switching roles of Portman and Kneightly both decorated actresses but here more wooden than Phasel's Wood where the Naboo scenes were filmed. The pod racing scene was an CGI overlong bore - it had been wisely trimmed down back in 1999.

What saves this from being a 1 star movie for me are the performances of Liam Neeson and the new CGI Yoda - placing the awful muppet. I also got to appreciate the real locations used as opposed to complete CGI sets for the next 2 entries. 

Every saga has a beginning... I just wish it wasn't this one."
"Feb 16, 2012",4,Loved it who cares about the changes die hard star wars fan for life
"Feb 16, 2012",2.5,"By far the weakest link in the Star Wars saga, now (amazingly)14 years down the line, all that was wrong with The Phantom Menace still stands, confusing plot, scrappy editing, clunky dialog, under used characters and Jar Jar Binks.
As for the 3D, it adds nothing to the movie what so ever, the scenes you visualise as standing out in 3D (the space battles and pod race) don't, and the beautiful visuals of Theed Palace and Naboo look dull through the 3D specs.
The film has two redeeming factors John Williams' fantastic musical score and the three way lightsabre battle between Jedi and Sith, that as it happens is the best in series."
"Feb 16, 2012",1,"While the visual effects were well done, every other aspect of Episode 1 suffered from Lucas' limited directorial skills. Sadly the series doesn't pick up in quality until Empire Strikes Back, in my view. The 3D version may look good, but the story and direction still suck."
"Feb 16, 2012",2,"It's not quite as bad as some would have you believe, but all the best bits are just replays from the original films, &amp; basically it's boring with annoying characters. 

The retrofitted 3D is patchy &amp; a waste of time (esp. since the kids refused to wear the glasses for most of the film). And unlike the superlative matte paintings &amp; model work of the originals the CGI veers from fantastic to shoddy &amp; back again. 

Wait for ""Episode IV"" when it gets good."
"Feb 16, 2012",5,We thought it was fantastic even better in 3D    The fight scenes &amp; special effects were brilliant
"Feb 16, 2012",3,"the movie is good, but not much 3d was used."
"Feb 16, 2012",3,"This is my least favorite of the Star Wars movies, and 3D did not change that.  While the 3D was good, it was not as spectacular as I expected.  I wouldn't recommend spending the extra money on the ticket."
"Feb 16, 2012",3.5,"In the first chapter of the Star Wars saga, two Jedi go to the planet of Naboo to try and resolve a conflict, but there's much more to deal with than they thought.  The Phantom Menace is a pretty good sci-fi flick.  Now, before I go any further, it's nowhere near as good as the original Star Wars films.  I look at the trilogies separate and not as a whole.  When I first saw this movie as a kid I loved it, so I think it's just gotten a bad wrap over time and the fact that it doesn't compare to the originals.  There are some awesome parts in this movie like the pod race and the final battle scene, and then there are some not so great things like Jar Jar Binks and the fact that the number one character they marketed the film about, Darth Maul is in the film about five minutes.  The story is passable and even George Lucas admits some things written in this film were mistakes.  There is good action in the film and it keeps you entertained. It's also fun to see back stories for characters you know and love.  The cast is good with Liam Neeson as Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn, Ewan McGregor as a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi and Natalie Portman as the Queen of Naboo all doing a good job.  Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker has gotten a lukewarm reception but let's remember he's a kid, in fact I didn't mind him as much as Hayden Christensen.  While it may not be the best in the saga, Star Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace still does what it's suppose to do, entertain and it's a must-see for any real Star Wars buff.

"Feb 16, 2012",2.5,Pod racing nad a not so stellar introduction to the Anakin story make this one a mediocre prequel. But points for bringing in Darth Maul.
"Feb 16, 2012",3,"The same, yet different.  This 3D update begins promisingly.  The opening titles stretching into space seem to be made for 3D treatment.  However, there is less 3D imagery that you might expect and what there is does not particularly add to the film.  It is some while since I saw this film, but it appears that they may have taken the opportunity to add in some additional footage and stretch the running time a little.  All sorts of actors appear in this film, whom you probably did not spot the first time - Keira Knightley, Dominic (The Wire) West and Celia (Acorn Antiques) Imrie to name but three.  You'll probably have more fun star spotting than you will get from the 3D, and it may distract you from Jar Jar Binks."
"Feb 16, 2012",1.5,Just as bad as the original
"Feb 16, 2012",1,May I just say how descised I am that they made Star Wars Episode I but in 3D that just shows no imagination
"Feb 15, 2012",3,"Not as bad as everyone said it was...  But seriously, it should have been better..."
"Feb 15, 2012",4.5,"Saw it the first time, but want to see if the 3D adds anything extra to it. And I'm a big Star Wars fan anyway, so why not?"
"Feb 15, 2012",5,"In 1977, George Lucas released Star Wars, the ultimate sci-fi popcorn flick-turned-pop-culture myth machine. It quickly became the biggest money-making film of all time and changed the shape of the film industry. After two successful sequels (1980's The Empire Strikes Back and 1983's Return of the Jedi) that extended the story of the first film, Lucas took some time off to produce movies for others, with mixed success. In 1999, Lucas returned to the Star Wars saga with a new approach -- instead"
"Feb 15, 2012",2,Disappointing when first released and still disappointing 16 years later.
"Feb 15, 2012",5,Best one of the series...
"Feb 15, 2012",5,AWESOME!!!!!! Can't wait til the other ones come out in 3-D.
"Feb 15, 2012",1,I still like the movie but the fact that they call this 3D is a joke. Their was nothing 3D about the whole movie. The only thing 3D about it was the fact that when you take your glasses off its blurry. I am going to give this a worse rating then the regular one because I wasted money.
"Feb 15, 2012",4,"The 3D conversion was very good (and I am not a huge 3D fan) with the pod race being fantastic.  Seeing it with my 7 year old daughter who got the chance to see Star Wars on a big screen for the 1st time was the highlight.  If you hate Jar Jar with a passion the 3D won't change your mind.  I may not be the most unbiased reviewer with my love of anything Star Wars, but Star Wars is always better on the big screen."
"Feb 15, 2012",2.5,"i loved the experience of this film in it's original release, but i was much younger then, and now it's obvious how much this film paddles to a younger audience .. the dialogue is painful at times, and let's not even talk about jar-jar please .. actually, no, let's do .. it's what brings this film down more than Lucas could ever have imagined .. it would be more tolerable if he didn't have more or as many lines as the main protagonists .. the action scenes, although eye pleasing no doubt, don't really hold much danger, but the pod racing sequence is still exciting and seemingly dangerous than ever, and is the highlight of this film .. but at two and a half hours, that small sequence is hardly enough to make up for the plodding pacing and bad acting .. the young anakin so unbelievable it makes me wonder just what Lucas was thinking .. was he rushed? uninterested? you would think he would have taken a little more time and pride with the jumping off act of a whole new series, not to mention the first chapter of the star wars saga .. compared to the excellent episode 3, episode 1 just doesn't cut it .. the 3D conversion is so-so, more like looking through a window to a 3D world than popping off the screen, as Alice in Wonderland did, or Avatar .. but i was wearing glasses, maybe i'll try contacts next time .."
"Feb 15, 2012",5,A sentimental five stars from me.
"Feb 15, 2012",3,"Meh...3D didn't make too much of a difference, the pod race looked cool. Still my least favorite Star Wars."
"Feb 15, 2012",4,"It is definitely not the best of the series, but knowing the origins of Darth Vader never stops being fun. The 3D conversion was very well done and the action scenes look spectacular."
"Feb 15, 2012",0.5,This was awful! It does not compare to he first two movies. Ugh!
"Feb 15, 2012",2.5,"3D was not that great. But, the special effects steal the show and make you forget the poor acting."
"Feb 15, 2012",1.5,"Nothing 3D about it, save for the podrace, which brings it up a notch. Probably the most fun of the prequels, but that's saying little, and this is just a money grabbing exercise (though hardly the first time Mr Lucas could be accused of that.)"
"Feb 15, 2012",3,"Good to see in 3D at times but can tell its not filmed in 3D, background is flat most of the time with cgi and main characters being put to 3D.  Still the good film it was but 3D is no Avatar!"
"Feb 15, 2012",3,"After having not seen a Star Wars film in over 10 year and not being the biggest fan, i wasnt expecting much. But i actually quite enjoyed this."
"Feb 15, 2012",2,"I think not only one to say this.
I would wait for episode  4,5,and 6, maybe 3 but that it"
"Feb 15, 2012",4,Loved seeing the movie again on the big screen.  Still not sure if  the 3D enhanced the experience.  Glad I didn't have to pay to see it.
"Feb 15, 2012",2.5,Don't waste your money seeing this in 3D.
"Feb 15, 2012",1.5,"Didn't they release this movie a decade ago? Oh wait..... Not even Star Wars fans I've heard want to see this, who is paying money? It's the same horrible movie it was a decade ago, only difference is now, it will hurt your eyes as well as your brain"
"Feb 15, 2012",3.5,"If you hated Phantom Menace the first time,then it isn't going to change your mind,but if your willing to give it a second chance or want to see a 3D Conversion that's done well,then its worth a watch,plus theres no better way to watch The Star Wars saga than on the Big Screen"
"Feb 15, 2012",4,I'm in a minority. This is a thrilling adventure with people that I really care about.
"Feb 15, 2012",1.5,"The only saving graces were the fight scenes with Darth Maul, who sadly, much like Boba Fett, met an premature/unfair demise."
"Feb 15, 2012",3,Can't fix what's broken just with 3D.
"Feb 15, 2012",2.5,"Having seen the film before, obviously I knew what I was getting myself into but I was really hoping that 3D would make the pod-racing/final fight with Darth Maul pretty amazing but it was a bit of a let down.  The 3-D just wasn't utilized well and at times I was wondering if it was even in 3-D at all.  Multiple times I took my glasses off and the film looked completely normal so they definitely didn't use 3-D throughout the entire film, which is a shame considering that's the only reason you'd pay extra to revisit this series.

Hopefully Lucas gets another company to do the 3-D conversion for the other films, because this one was a waste of money.  Could have just popped in the blu-ray and enjoyed a much better experience at my home."
"Feb 15, 2012",0.5,"Yesterday ""The Muppets"" reminded me what a fun place a cinema auditorium can be, today this showed me it can also be depressing and soul destroying.
In order to put an eighteenth generation of his family through college, George Lucas now presents the ""Star Wars"" movies in 3D. All that jumps out of the screen is sheer unbridled cynicism, this is the worst 3D I've ever seen and that's saying a lot after some of the shoddy affairs Hollywood has thrown at us lately. 3D gives most people a headache and when it's your beloved ""Star Wars"" being butchered you'll have your heart broken too. The awful retro-fitting of 3D here makes everything look like it's made out of cardboard. Scenes involving actors standing in front of a greenscreen look exactly like that, it's akin to watching an intergalactic weather report.
I've been sitting on the fence regarding 3D but this has cemented my opinion, it's not just a gimmick, it's a scam, one which adds nothing to a film other than an extra few dollars on your ticket price. Likewise I've been passive about Lucas, always giving him a bye for making my childhood so much richer, but no more. This man is ruining cinema! That might seem like an over-reaction but consider this; in 2005 at the ShoWest movie exhibitor's convention in Las Vegas, he along with James Cameron and Robert Zemeckis made a presentation which ultimately convinced the owners of cinemas worldwide to switch from film projection to the digital alternative. The result of this has been the redundancy of thousands of projectionists across the world, skilled professionals, some who had been in the business so long as to have handled thick crispy 75mm prints of ""Ben Hur"". Now cinemagoers place their faith in IT specialists who control eighteen separate screens from one control room and think celluloid is something women get on their asses when they eat too much Haagen Dasz. The switch to digital was mainly to facilitate 3D but also to give more power to bearded butchers like the three mentioned. Some cinema chains literally ""dial-up"" Hollywood and stream the movie from a server somewhere in Silicon Valley. This gives the suits at the studios a scary amount of power. Let's say a movie is released with a downbeat ending, I'll use David Fincher's ""Seven"" as an example. It opens poorly on it's first weekend so the studio decide to give it a happy ending using footage the director was forced to shoot as a backup. See it on Friday and Paltrow's head is in a box, see it on Tuesday and she's walking off into the sunset with Brad Pitt. 
As for the movie itself, it's in no way a good film but viewed in the context of the prequel trilogy it's watchable, I recommend the Blu-ray release from last year if you have to see it.
I've spent a fortune on ""Star Wars"" over the years and despite Lucas' constant tinkering they've always brought me joy but this is the end of the road. Should you go see this? To use a word Lucas seems all too fond of: Noooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Feb 15, 2012",5,"I loved watching this movie because it is purely a sci-fi classic.  Apparently all of the negative reviews are from those who don't appreciate science fiction.  So please, do yourself a great favor and don't write a review!!!!  Just because you don't like science fiction doesn't mean that that whole world doesn't like it."
"Feb 15, 2012",1,"George Lucas returns once again to f*** up Star Wars, this time with a half-assed 3D conversion.  The Phantom Menace is complete and utter garbage that is actually painful to watch (even more so in 3D).  The story is beyond stupid; the Saga begins....with a taxing dispute?!  And, the acting (if it can even be called that) is cringe worthy, which is surprising given the talent on hand (Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel L. Jackson), but somehow Lucas found a way to make their performances unbearable to watch.  Another cardinal sin of the film is the CGI effects, which are distracting and do nothing to enhance the film.  George Lucas never learns from his mistakes, he just compounds them.  The Phantom Menace is just as horrendously awful in 3D as it was in 2D."
"Feb 15, 2012",1.5,The movie that introduces the Jamaican retard known as Jar-Jar Binks as a failed attempt at comic relief.  This movie was and still is a massive disappointment.
"Feb 15, 2012",4,Great movie still love it as much as when it came out......little dissapointed with the 3-D though
"Feb 15, 2012",5,Just walked out from Star War STAR WARS: Episode I - The Phantom Menance 3D Motion Chair D-BOX at the Harbour City Golden Harvest
"Feb 15, 2012",2,"Seen this movie on the weekend and the  movie is no different then the first. Now the 3d makes it an ok movie, but im not going to see it agen in a long while...."
"Feb 15, 2012",1.5,"A complete con, even for hardcore fans. There's more 3D in the trailer and no amount of technical wizardry anyway will get you round the fact that this is the worst of all the Star Wars movies by far. Avoid."
"Feb 15, 2012",3,"Not bad, but the 3-D effect was very minimal."
"Feb 15, 2012",3.5,"This is my fav of the prequels. Yes it has Jar Jar and the annoying kid. BUT, it also has Liam Neeson as Quai Gon Jin (a badass Jedi), Darth Maul (the dopest Sith you'll ever see besides Vader), Obi Wan before he became a pussy, the first instances of the Jedi Council on screen (and Courascaunt is dope), Pod Racing, which is quite exciting, that whole underwater sequence (""there's always a bigger fish""), and the finest light sabre / jedi battles you will see in ANY of the movies (after this they got WAY too coreographed)... On top of all that is a fairly intriguing ""espionage"" self-contained story about alien trade disputes that trumps both the flimsy ""lead-up to Darth Vader"" stories of the next two prequels. Yeah, Phantom Menace is the best of the prequels."
"Feb 14, 2012",4,"I know he's a kid, but that kid is the suckiest actor I have EVER seen. Everything else was great though."
"Feb 14, 2012",2.5,"There was potential, no matter what others say.  Jar Jar is more irrelevant and annoying now, 13 years later then i remember him.  Of course i had only just turned 10 when the original release occurred, and now i see more clearly the true ridiculousness this character embodied."
"Feb 14, 2012",3,"Some scenes we great in 3D, most others you had no additional 3D effects.  Not worth it."
"Feb 14, 2012",3.5,"Entretenida aunque esta lejos de ser gloriosa como los demas episodios de esta gran saga, creo que el 3D esta bien para ser una pelicula de hace 10 aÃ±os y esperemos que para los proximos episodios mejoren la tecnica y tengamos algo de mas calidad por lo pronto el primer episodio es palomero y nada mas!"
"Feb 14, 2012",4,StarWars fans must see this in 3D! My 5 year old loved it!
"Feb 14, 2012",3,"I know it's the cool thing to hate Star Wars, but I'm a fan and always will be. This prequel is decent, even with it's setbacks (friggin JAR JAR, man). But I can't help but smile to at the final battle set to DUEL OF THE FATES."
"Feb 14, 2012",3,"Buena historia, pero por que los gringos tienen que danar las zagas agregando personajes estupidos en situaciones estupidas?...algo similar a lo que sucedio con Indiana Jones."
"Feb 14, 2012",2.5,It's a bad movie where everything goes wrong and I'll still watch it.
"Feb 14, 2012",4,I find my opinion of this movie much more positive as I mature. I find myself being fascinated with the politics of the Republic.... and also Darth Maul is a BAMF!
"Feb 14, 2012",4.5,Loved the pod racers but wish they would have turned the sound up more...
"Feb 14, 2012",4.5,I don't give a shit. It's part of my childhood and I love it.
"Feb 14, 2012",0.5,There are hardly any scenes featuring noticeable 3D.
"Feb 14, 2012",4,Jar Jar Binks is garbage...but Darth Maul was pretty sweet...especially when the doors opened up and that music began...dun dun dun dunnnnnnnnn...awesome
"Feb 14, 2012",2.5,"3D completely pointless, I was hoping to get smacked in the head by a lightsabre and instead I got a face full of JarJar Binks, he's not so much of a legend when your not 10."
"Feb 14, 2012",5,"3D done like it should be done..
Was the BEST 3D movie I have ever seen.

Something as simple as the dunes, coming before one another, which is before the background of the horizon, trees coming out in perfect depth and so forth.

I look forward to the rest."
"Feb 14, 2012",5,"Oh come one, don't be so serious."
"Feb 14, 2012",3,Can't believe it is 13 years since I first saw this! No need for the 3D though. Lots of fun and I get the point that Lucas invented Jar Jar for the kids. Perfunctory story telling and character development but.... Still better than I remembered!
"Feb 14, 2012",3.5,"While it's comes off as desperately unfunny and flat in many points, Phantom Menace succeeds through exquisite world building and a genuine sense of fun."
"Feb 14, 2012",0.5,"Contains possibly the worst performance by a child in cinema history, and the
most annoying CG character ever...(guess who?)."
"Feb 14, 2012",2.5,"Whereas I liked the movie, 3D didn't make it nearly as awesome as I thought it would be. I think I'll settle for watching everything else on Blu-Ray. I also realized that Natalie Portman and Jake Llyod have very few facial or vocal expressions--though she has an excuse in the copious amounts of makeup requisite for her royal role."
"Feb 14, 2012",2,although they did not take out jarjar binks the 3d adds so much depth to the original film helping to ignore a ignorant character
"Feb 14, 2012",4.5,"a must see movie...  Star Wars, still the movie to watch..."
"Feb 14, 2012",4,The 3D experience of this spectaculer re-release was unlikely. The film still packs some action wallop to keep us hooked but still could use some fixing of the broken plot and characters.
"Feb 14, 2012",2.5,"When I first saw this movie, I was like a lot of fans, waited in anticipation.  As the years have gone by, with the series complete, I list this one near the bottom.  I love Darth Maul, the pod race and the double bladed light sabre.  But, Jar Jar and the Gungans and the overly political aspect of the story was an absolute bore.  I think what happen was Lucas waited too long to start the prequels.  If he'd followed the formula of the original trilogy, then it could've survived.  The force isn't with this movie."
"Feb 14, 2012",4,"In 3D or not, a Star Wars movie will remain a Star Wars movie and I LOVE it. This saga needs to be watched in a theatre to enjoy it 100%.  I just don't really see the added value in this case except for 2 or 3 scenes... Nevertheless it is definitely worth going if you're an addict :)"
"Feb 14, 2012",2,holy friggin boring Batman!
"Feb 14, 2012",3,I expected a little more with the addition of 3D but it felt a little flat. There are only a few scene that it really works to get the action in your face. Overall I was happy to see Star Wars on the big screen but the 3D still needs work when converting.
"Feb 13, 2012",1,Still one of the worst films ever made and even more so in 3D.
"Feb 13, 2012",5,"Ð¯ Ð 1/2Ðµ Ð 1/4Ð 3/4Ð³ Ð 1/2Ðµ Ð¿Ð 3/4Ñ?Ð 1/4Ð 3/4Ñ,ÑÐµÑ,Ñ, ÐµÑ?Ð»Ð¸ Ð²Ñ&lt;Ñ...Ð 3/4Ð´Ñ?Ñ, Star Wars, Ñ,Ð 3/4 Ð´Ð»Ñ? Ð 1/4ÐµÐ 1/2Ñ? Ñ?Ñ,Ð 3/4 Ð²Ñ?ÐµÐ³Ð´Ð° Ð»ÑÑÑÐ¸Ð¹ ÑÐ¸Ð»ÑÐ 1/4 Ð³Ð 3/4Ð´Ð°. Ð±ÐµÐ· Ð²Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð°Ð 1/2Ñ,Ð 3/4Ð²;-)"
"Feb 13, 2012",3.5,"Seeing it in theaters again I understand it more and realize that people were a lot harder on this film than they should have been, however it's not without faults of stilted dialogue and weak acting. There are true moments of genius."
"Feb 13, 2012",5,its a good movie stop being so fucking jaded you rotten somebitches
"Feb 13, 2012",2.5,"George Lucas' 3D conversion of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is an improvement and quite jaw dropping, unfortunately it isn't enough to mask Young Anakin's bad acting and Jar Jar Binks"
"Feb 13, 2012",2.5,"Bad casting/characters (Jake Lloyd/JarJar) and a bad script.  Lucas' should have asked for help with writing this instead of watching 20 years of Saturday morning cartoons to get most of his dialogue.  The worst of the Star Wars movies.  Liam Neeson though, nails it."
"Feb 13, 2012",1,Thank god this wasn't actually the first Star Wars movie released....or there never would have been a second.
"Feb 13, 2012",3.5,"It is always good to see a Star Wars movie on the big screen, even if the 3D was some what lacking. I feel that Ep 1 adds to the mythology of the series, specifically the Jedi vs sith scenario. All in all, it's a messy but fun story that adds to the Star Wars universe."
"Feb 13, 2012",5,Just saw it with Ethan my son! May the force be with you!
"Feb 13, 2012",2,"Okay, I know what you guys are going to say. Why pay $14.50 for a movie you've heard sucks? Well, hear me out. I've only seen the original 1977 Star Wars. I was planning on watching them all on blu-ray, but then heard they will be re-releasing all of them, so I thought, ""how could I say no to seeing such a groundbreaking series in theaters?"" I had to drag myself out to see the worst reviewed one out of the series, but I did. I have to say, most of the reviews, even from the time when the backlash with this film was so harsh, were pretty accurate. It's not terrible, but it's not that good either. I'm not going to harp on the same old criticisms (Jar-Jar, Jake Lloyd's performance, etc.) but I will say, I don't know what happened here. The first hour or so, I was very bored. The pod race scene relieved some of the feeling, but then it was put back on me until the last twenty minutes or so. One thing that irritated me like no other throughout the movie was something that happened in the beginning. When Obi-Wan &amp; Qui-Gon are fighting those.. I don't know what they're called. They're like robots. Why is it that they fought with light sabres the entire time until the end when Qui-Gon put his away, then used the force on the remaining few? Why didn't he use the force on all of them? Maybe restrictions with the force were explained in an earlier chapter, but that small thing bothered me. Overall, I was disappointed in this movie, but I was expecting it. I don't think I'd recommend this unless you wanna watch the whole saga."
"Feb 13, 2012",1.5,the 3D was the same caliber of Clash Of The Titans .....just pop in the blu-rays and save your money
"Feb 13, 2012",4,Nothing new besides stuff popping out at you.
"Feb 13, 2012",3.5,Star Wars in 3d is just fun to watch.
"Feb 13, 2012",4,Solid! Great 3D not over done. Story n effects hold up.
"Feb 13, 2012",0.5,Just because it's in 3D doesn't make it a good movie.
"Feb 13, 2012",0.5,"Biggest disappointment of the 20th century, now in 3D.
Too bad they can't make the writing and acting 3d as well."
"Feb 13, 2012",2.5,"The film brings back great memories of going to the theater for the first time, but it's not enough to save itself."
"Feb 13, 2012",4,"The best 3D conversion I've seen.  I wish it would have had more depth.  Yes Jar Jar should have 90% of his screen tIme removed, but the final 30 minutes is pure Star Wars excellence."
"Feb 13, 2012",2.5,Worst of the entire star wars saga
"Feb 13, 2012",2,"Haven't bothered with the 3D, but the movie itself isn't really that good. George definitely knows how to make the action scenes look cool, and that's usually enough to overshadow a bad story. But this...he fails at all of the basics of storytelling. There is no way to overlook that, and it just ruins the whole thing."
"Feb 13, 2012",2.5,"No plot, Loses the spirit of the Original films. Its really boring, but the Darth Maul lightsaber is the only that is good in this movie Darth maul."
"Feb 13, 2012",5,It was awesome the first time I saw it too!
"Feb 13, 2012",2.5,"The Pod race is overrated, but the fight at the end is worth watching."
"Feb 13, 2012",0.5,The more I think about it the more I hate it. People are hating on John Carter when this is clearly a far worse movie.
"Feb 13, 2012",4,"Yes, yes, I know, I get it, it's ""not as good as the originals,"" but what is? It's old news. Why is Star Wars being released in theaters in 3D? Ask any fanboy why, and he'll tell you. Why not? With visual magic, operatic music, and cheesy melodrama to spare, this is exactly what makes the Star Wars so fascinating. These movies aren't made for the pretentious film-goer with his/her notepad, furiously scribbling down the importance of high drama and film technique. They are for children of all ages. I saw the film in its first theatrical release in '99 and I adore every minute of it as much now as I did then. This is adventure of the highest degree. Sure you roll your eyes at some of the corny dialogue or the select characters that seem to be a bad racial stereotype (cough, Jar Jar, Watto, cough). But you stay for the magic of escapist film-making. Watching it again I reverted back to my wide-eyed, adolescent self cuddling a bucket of popcorn and traveling to a galaxy far, far away... Here's hoping you make the trip too!"
"Feb 13, 2012",2.5,"Way better than Episode II and III, but then again, Episode II and III are not movies. They are steaming piles of George Lucas shit. This movie gets a 50% because of Obi Wan and Darth Maul.

Ok well here are some of the negatives:
- Brutal Yoda puppet. Yikes.
- The dialogue, holy moly who hired the 6th graders?
- Getting scientific with the force... Midacloreans? However it was spelt, garbage idea.
- JarJar, need I say more.
- CGI, green screen settings, Double Yikes!"
"Feb 13, 2012",3,still loved seeing star wars again but the 3d was nothing special. not worth the extra money
"Feb 13, 2012",4,"A Long time ago.....when I first saw The Phantom Menace on its original release in 1999, I can remember the entire audience bursting into applause at the end. Admittedly it wasn't as good as the original trilogy but I along with the rest of the cinema thoroughly enjoyed it. 
Then the reviews started coming. The kid can't act, the direction is stiff, Jar Jar is ridiculous, the list goes on. All valid points but who cares. The bottom line is that The Phantom Menace is a great movie to kick off the prequels.
There are some great set pieces that really shine, even more so in 3D. The pod race is very impressive and from what I could gather, now includes the entire 2nd lap. We also get to see what I consider the best light saber battle of all six movies. I couldn't wait to experience the epic Darth Maul duel in 3D and it didn't disappoint.
As far as Jar Jar Binks is concerned, yes he is annoying in parts but my 6 year old daughter laughed at every lame joke so he must be doing something right? 
We also get to meet some interesting new characters and are reacquainted with some old favourites that never fail to entertain.
If I had a gripe it would be that the political goings on are way too complex for any kid, teenager or some adults to follow. The movie really grinds to a halt after the pod race as we get bogged down in bureaucratic mumbo jumbo.
That aside though it's great to see how it all gets started and the added third dimension just makes it all that much satisfying."
"Feb 13, 2012",3,"Jar jar 
Nuff said !"
"Feb 13, 2012",3,The 3D was nothing special. Seen the movie already a few years back. Save your money.
"Feb 13, 2012",5,It's Star Wars in 3D! DUH!!!!
"Feb 13, 2012",1.5,A heaping pile of suck.
"Feb 13, 2012",3,If it wasn't for Darth Maul being in this movie for what...10 minutes this movie would have really sucked!
"Feb 13, 2012",5,JAr JAr Binks in the 3D that is all one has to say!
"Feb 13, 2012",3,Not that inpressed by the 3d
"Feb 13, 2012",4.5,"I've never seen any Star Wars films before, and this was a great place to start. The 3D effects were amazing, especially at the race part, and it's just a great film."
"Feb 13, 2012",2.5,"Que reste t'il de ce fameux Ã (C)pisode 1 13 ans aprÃ (C)s sa sortie? Bah finalement pas grand chose. Le film Ã  du mal Ã  passer l'Ã (C)preuve du temps, le rÃ´le de Darth Maul (seul vrai interÃªt du film) est vraiment rÃ (C)duit Ã  peau de chagrin, l'intrigue politique est plutÃ´t bien mais mal amÃ (C)nÃ (C)e, la rÃ (C)a est plate, la synthÃ¨se commence Ã  devenir gerbante et il n'y a vraiment plus la saveur d'antan... Et evidemmentla 3D ne sertÃ  rien... Bref, cet Ã (C)pisode 1, j'aurais mieux fait de la garder comme un souvenir..."
"Feb 13, 2012",1.5,"It was painful enough in 2D. I'm not donating to the ""Lucas Fund for Getting Rich Off of Star Wars Regurgitation""."
"Feb 13, 2012",3.5,"The film is great but the 3D is not. Great picture and sound but unfortunately the 3D just doesn't work with this film, wait until the DVD."
"Feb 13, 2012",2,"Ah, what the heck. If you're interested in the turn of events that get you to the story of Luke Skywalker, this is a must-watch. However, they are very liberal with their use of screen wipes and cheesy lines from Jar Jar that seem to be very unsuitable for this sort of movie. It feels like it could be more epic than it is. A remake maybe...?"
"Feb 12, 2012",2.5,"The plot is there, it just isn't interesting enough to follow and the characters are there, they just aren't developed enough to be interesting. There's too much of Jar Jar and not enough of Darth Maul; so it's the same movie we all remember, now with one more dimension of disappointment."
"Feb 12, 2012",1,"Piece of shit when it was made, piece of shit now.... Shame George Lucas Shame...."
"Feb 12, 2012",5,Pure AWESOMENESS!!!!!!
"Feb 12, 2012",4,Actually thought the 3D made this much better by giving us some more visual oomph to offset its thin dialogue and slow patches. Actually think after years of not seeing it on the big screen it wasn't a bad way to start the new movies.
"Feb 12, 2012",0.5,Medicloreans!  Fucking Medicloreans!  Really?  FUCK YOU GEORGE LUCAS!
"Feb 12, 2012",2,This movie just shows how far George Lucas has fallen since the original trilogy. He creates an amazing badass character like Darth Maul and kills him off right away instead of keeping him alive till Episode 3 and creating what might've been a great storyline of Obi-Wan working his way to get revenge. Instead his loyal fans are left watching two more dull movies showing a boring story of emo Anakin feeling like he doesn't belong in the Jedi world and slowly works his way towards to the dark side. I can honestly say the first time i considered killing myself out of boredom was when I was in a theater watching Star Wars Episode II. That movie made Cowboys and Aliens look like The Godfather Part II
"Feb 12, 2012",3.5,Worth it for the pod race in 3d! Great backstory if you can handle more detail than action.
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"Like Deja Vu, in 3-D."
"Feb 12, 2012",1,"Poorly paced, stale and juvenile."
"Feb 12, 2012",1.5,"3d hurts not helps by making the picture too dark.  At 2.5 hours, I'd forgotten how boring this was.  My 5 year old son didn't move a muscle during Hugo but was unable to focus with this long uneven flick."
"Feb 12, 2012",3,Just because its in 3d that wont make jar jar go away it will just make George Lucas bank account bigger.
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"I can't give a poor review for the greatest saga of all time. The 3D effects were ok but not great. The race was nice, and being surrounded by the red blaster rays when flying into trouble really made you feel you're a part of the danger of being shot. But I left the theater with the feeling that I should expect more for my money. 3D movies seem a bit over-rated. Star Wars as a drama is theological and as a child with little understanding of human behavior back in 1977 i was hooked forever. But in practical relations it falls short at times. I accepted this long long ago but when my wife suggested we see it in 3D, well how can I argue with her. For once I wasn't thinking about myself when taking her to see my favorite film series. So don't force your significant other to see this or go for your own self indulgence if you're a fanatic because you may be slightly disappointed. But if invited ...why not?"
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"No me la pude ver en cine la primera vez, buen sonido y un 3D aceptable."
"Feb 12, 2012",5,I  Love It I Love Star Ware
"Feb 12, 2012",4,"""A communications disruption can mean only one thing... Invasion."""
"Feb 12, 2012",5,"i think its safe to say Star Wars was made for 3D, the lightsaber fights actually had depth (no pun intended), the space sequences looked amazing and the podracing sequence was really awesome, i wanted to scream how awesome throughtout the entire race! I look forward to episode 3 in 3D, episode 2 not so much."
"Feb 12, 2012",1,"The best of the prequel trilogy, which is like being king of Shit Mountain"
"Feb 12, 2012",2,The movie is still disappointing even in 3D. The 3D effects could have and should have been better. Will I see all the other Star Wars movies theatrically for their 3D releases? Yes! But The Phantom Menace still has tons of room for improvement.
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"Thriteen years since I last saw this on the big screen and guess what? Jar Jar isn't as bad as I thought he was. Yes, Jake Lloyd is bad, but it all comes down to the writing and that is all on George Lucas. Some of the lines and delivery is laughable. The plot is a little boring and it is only there to set things up for the next two films. What is gone is the charm and humor of the original trilogy. But thanks to Liam Nesson, Ewan McGregor, the Pod race scene, Darth Maul, and the final 20 minutes, this so-called ""worst episode"" is still a solid sci-fi adventure film for all ages. 

Grade: B"
"Feb 12, 2012",2,3D is pointless.   Barely noticeable most of the movie.  Why waste the money
"Feb 12, 2012",3.5,"Back when this came out originally I was too hyped to be disappointed. This time hmm, it's not a bad film, but feels sorta unnecessary. Needed more Maul!"
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"After watching it again, it doesn't seem to suck quite as bad as I thought it did the first time I watched.  The effects still hold up today, and that last fight scene is still my favorite out of the entire series.  The story still just as boring, and other than the bad guy who's only in the movie for like 10 minutes, I don't care about any of the other characters.  When even Samuel L. Jackson's part is boring you know you got problems.  Only reccomended if you got a good-ass entertainment system."
"Feb 12, 2012",0.5,Porcaria. Nem parece que foi o mesmo autor de Star Wars. Em 3D (? Onde? CaÃ§a nÃ­quel!)
"Feb 12, 2012",4,Gavin really liked it. I think this movie was just At his level i hope they release the rest of them
"Feb 12, 2012",4.5,Brings back good memories
"Feb 12, 2012",1,"George Lucas's first step into ruining the Star Wars franchise is back in theaters and some things have been changed and believe me, it is not for the best. The movie is still a train wreck and Darth Maul is still incredibly awesome and underused. We all saw The Phantom Menace back when it first came out in 1999, and kids like me didn't fully realize how bad this was. However, 13 years later I can honestly say i understand why this movie is horrible. If anyone remembers there is virtually no plot line, that hasn't changed a bit. The story is convoluted and muddled deep in useless details that the audience forgets why they care and only want to see the lightsaber scenes. The acting is bland and the new characters are virtually pointless.It is the Anti-Star Wars movie, the Star Wars movie that is on the polar opposite end of the spectrum of greatness established by the original trilogy. Now with the rerelease comes the post 3D conversion, and there is honestly nothing that strikes the audience as amazing. Everything looks dated and the 3D is nothing more than a cash grab by George Lucas. This isn't even the original cut from 1999, this is the altered version by Lucas that was made to ""improve"" it. Bottom line is, the jedis have super speed now, Yoda is now 100% CGI and not the puppet, more pointless dialogue, and Darth Maul's role is not even made more important. How one comes about giving Obi Wan Kenobi and Quai Gon Jin super speed but not giving the best character a back story is beyond my understanding. Overall this is only good for nostalgia. I will admit i smiled when I heard John Williams score again and Darth Maul is still the best part. But it truly takes talent to make a terrible movie even worse. If you love Star Wars, you already know how bad this is, if your new, go find the original trilogy on dvd. Please do not waste your life on this, you will be glad you missed it."
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"There is too much hyperoble surrounding anything ""Star Wars"".  Fanboys hate the new trilogy because, well to be perfectly honest, it was the wrong three to make, and Lucas did a horrible job with the scripts.  Everyone who loved the original movies emotionally bought into the characters, and it would have been interesting to see where the Star Wars universe progressed to since we last visited it (as oppossed to seeing how it got to were it is...).  Lucas' tinkering with everything has also worn thin...

I am a fanboy.  I was the boy, who at age 8, had A New Hope memorized from start to finish, and thanks to my parents using the movie theatre as a babysitter, I viewed the movie no less than 26 times during it's run in my small town.  Empire has grown on me, and now sits a top my favourites, followed closely by a New Hope.  Return of the Jedi has never really sat well with me (largely because the Ewoks were my childhood's Jar Jar). 

Phantom Menace was one of the biggest disappointments I have ever experienced.  Soooo much hype when it first came out, that there was no way it could live up to everyone's expectations.  I remember seething for days afterwards, and telling my friends (and anyone else who would listen) how angry I was.  Of course, I wasn't angry enough not to go see it for a second time later that week, just to make sure I didn't miss anything (lol).

The other two were ""okay"", and much like the Clone Wars cartoon series they help fill a little of the Star Wars void that creeps up in my life from time to time, but they really do not capture in any way, shape, or form the feelings I have for the Epsiodes 4, 5, and for some parts, 6.

But, ever the dutiful Star Wars fan, I lined up with my family to see Phantom Menace in 3D Saturday night.  I fully expected the theatre to be packed (since when is any Star Wars event not jammed to the rafters).  Surprisingly, when the movie started the theatre was only 50% full...with very few fanboys in site (nobody brought a light sabre to my showing...sigh).

Half-way through the movie, I was totally enjoying the 3D technical aspects (it is well done and refrains from being gimmicky..instead, opting more for a depth of field perspective that will, at times, make you gasp with awe).  At the same point in the movie, I was totally hating Jar-Jar and all the other plot issues that everyone harps on, when I looked over and saw the face of my 10 year old daughter.  She was mesmorized and on the edge of her seat...

Then it dawned on me.  Lucas did not make this movie for me, nor my childhood memories.  He made it for the other 8, 9 and 10 year olds who go to the movie theatre not expecting the worst for the money they spent, but rather the sure joy and magic of the experience.  She is not jaded by all the fan boy discussion or the critics who harp on minor plot details or apparent racism (really?  does anyone seriously think that Lucas sat down, put on a white robe and triangle hood, and hammered out Jar Jar as a reflection of his views on a ""typical black from the Southern States""?).

Lucas made the movie for kids who play video games and still look for magic and adventure when they go to the theatre.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.   When I put down my distain, and looked through my daughter's eyes, I truly enjoyed the movie (even with the Gungans..but I still can't get over the horrible masks used for the Trade Federation..seriously....)."
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"Not much 3D (which I usually don't care for anyway), but the kids' first big screen Star Wars experience sure was fun!"
"Feb 12, 2012",4,Sounds good and looks good in 3D... Definitely my favorite star wars movie.. But the added 3D effects are good
"Feb 12, 2012",3.5,"I can almost remember when The Phantom Menace opened thirteen years ago.  As a kid then, I still remember being on the edge of my seat anticipating what would then be the ""best movie I had ever seen.""  And when the words ""Star Wars"" hit the screen from the farthest regions of outer space, you couldn't help but to feel like this was more than a movie-it was an experience.  Star Wars is one of those movies you tell your children that you remember going to see.  But this addition to the chapter, after thirteen years, struggles to find its place with the rest of the prequels as part of the Star War's universe.
	Watching the movie now, you realize all the ways The Phantom Menace fails more than it succeeds.  The film is overshadowed by a weak storyline, poor acting, and forgettable characters new to the franchise.  Even the characters featured in the movie from the other films-Obi Wan Kenobi, C3P0, R2D2, Yoda-are not themselves it seems.  Ewan McGregor does his best to do a young Alec Guinness impression while Yoda's younger appearance looked quite ridiculous.  It's sad when the droids-C3P0 and R2D2-- are the most recognizable characters to the original trilogy and actually make the film feel a part of Star Wars.
	As a true Star Wars fan, the most disturbing factor of the film is its dependence of CGI.  It's an insult to the grandiose sets and production work that went into the original trilogy that the majority of this movie was made with blue screens and computers.  CGI is a tool and an aid-- not a crutch and a lifeline.  You almost get the impression that the actors themselves must have been bored, affecting the movie itself.  I distinctly recall wishing the pod race would fast forward so it would end.  Lots of the action scenes lacked intensity which is not typical of the previous Star Wars films. 
	Despite its shortcomings, Episode I is still a Star Wars film.  It belongs and contributes to making the entire epic saga as much as Episodes IV, V, and VI.  All of the movie's mistakes were forgiven when Darth Maul was revealed to the Jedi and the epic and inevitable lightsaber battle ensued.  I think certain scenes in the movie make up for and overshadow the bad parts.  As a Star Wars fan, you find yourself defending Episode I more than praising it.  Though it's difficult to embrace this movie as epic or even describe it as a really good film, you can't help but to love it or maybe parts of it if you love Star Wars."
"Feb 12, 2012",5,3d not amazing but can't go wrong with star wars :).
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"I love the Star Wars films, but not enough to pay current theater prices for Phantom Menace."
"Feb 12, 2012",0.5,"Star Wars is a movie phenomenon and part of our society's popular culture. In spite of what the hardcore fans say, the original trilogy are not the best films ever made. Their faults are numerous and have been the butt of many jokes in shows such as 'Family Guy'. Lucas' success was creating a fully immersive universe full of iconic characters that allow us to escape reality. So when he announced that the prequels were being made, excitement was off the scale. I remember sitting waiting for the curtain to go up for 'The Phantom Menace' when it was released in 1999 and bursting with expectation. Then I remember the crushing disappointment that followed as the horror unfolded on screen. 
Back to 2012. 'The Phantom Menace' is re-released in 3D. Do I A) Remember how bad it is and avoid? Or B) Part with some hard earned cash to make George a little bit richer? Those who went for 'B' give yourselves a gold star. 
From the start, boredom reins supreme. The introductory scrolling text is about taxation of trade routes and a blockade by 'The Trade Federation'. Who needs Rebel Alliances or Galactic Empires when you can base a plot around trade disputes! Much of the film is bogged down in tedious political plots and manoeuvring. 
What action there is centres around the Jedi Qui Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) as they battle the Droid army of the Trade Federation. Unlike Storm Troopers, the Droids make terrible bad guys. Sure, Storm Troopers are pretty useless but the Droids make them look like pros. Not only do the standard Battle Droids look like Games Workshop rejects but they offer all the resistance of a wet paper bag. You never feel they're a genuine threat. Their limited dialogue is meant to be humorous but instead makes them seem completely stupid. Why would somebody design an army of robots, spend billions on constructing it only to make them as effective as 'The Three Stooges'?
Darth Maul, the Dark Jedi who takes on the heroes, finally brings some credibility to proceedings but it is too little too late. He is the only colour in a mire of drab characters. Unfortunately the other stand out is Jar Jar Binks. So much bile and hatred has been written about him over the years (and rightly so), that all I'll say is 'Worst movie decision ever'. 
Anakin Skywalker (A.K.A. a young Darth Vader) falls into the category of 'annoying movie brat'. His infatuation with the teenage Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman), which is central to the plot of the prequels, is messed up as the age gap between them is so great. Oh, and get this. Anakin Skywalker built C3 P0. To provide more of a link with the original trilogy, Lucas decides to provide us with the back stories of not only C3 P0 but R2 D2 as well. This truly jumps the shark. 
We also get more explanation about The Force. Jedi can harness it due to having a high count of midi-chlorians in their blood - microscopic organisms that allow them to connect with the force. The higher their midi-chlorian count; the stronger the Jedi. So instead of being a mystical field of energy that unites all living things, a metaphysical and ubiquitous power, The Force is reduced to the status of a virus. How were the Jedi wiped out? Someone prescribed them Tamiflu. Ridiculousness reaches new levels when we learn that Anakin Skywalker was 'immaculately conceived' by the midi-chlorians. By now fans are starting to get seriously hacked off. 
Another noteworthy happening is during the underwater journey from Gungan City to save Queen Amidala (who was apparently elected to server her people, surely a first for royalty) from the Trade Federation invasion. Qui Gon and Obi Wan's craft is caught by a giant predator, only to be saved when the attacker is snapped up by a bigger creature. Five minutes or so later, exactly the same thing happens again. I'm not kidding, it's like the film was made by a five year old; 'Again Daddy, do it again'. 
Dialogue is horrendous throughout, especially that given to Trade Federation characters. We know Lucas can't write dialogue worth toffee from the earlier Star Wars movies, but he hits a new low here. Even Liam Neeson can't make bring it to life, which is saying something. Acting is equally cringe worthy. The CGI characters give the same level of performance as the humans.  
'The Phantom Menace' reveals George Lucas as the hack who got lucky he really is. If he'd released this instead of 'A New Hope' back in 1978 the franchise would have sunk without a trace. Of course, then we'd have to believe that he had all six movies mapped out from the beginning, which I don't. How could he have got things so wrong? Possibly because nobody at the studio says 'No' to him. All his ideas are assumed to be guaranteed money spinners and are green-lighted automatically. There's so much fiction set in the Star Wars universe; both published and fan. It would have been so easy to get a writer or two with the knowledge and love of the series to construct a decent plot. Unfortunately Lucas is given God-like control over proceedings. He might as well have urinated on the fans whilst stealing their wallets. 
Re-releasing 'The Phantom Menace' in 3D can only be seen as a cynical ploy to increase his personal fortune. As it wasn't filmed with 3D in mind it has been post rendered which makes the whole thing a pointless exercise. I hearby solemnly swear that I will never, ever, watch 'The Phantom Menace' again."
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"I saw it last night in 3d, brings up memories of the anticipation of when this film first came out. I'm not as harsh as most people are on this one, but I think it's the weakest of the films. The dialogue and acting for the most part is somewhat childish. Natalie Portman is surprisingly flat and bland throughout. Liam Neeson is fantastic as always, and probably saves this film. Seeing it again, I can sense the disappointment of fans from a decade ago. It's just doesn't have the characters we know and love."
"Feb 12, 2012",2,"I rated this film way too high when it first came out... and seeing it again... well... its both better and worse than I remember. Jar Jar didnt bother me as much this time, but Jake Lloyd as young Anakin is just terrible... with all the good kid actors out there... why him? On the plus side, Natalie Portman is super cute throughout and the by-play between Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson works fairly well.. As to the 3D conversion... mostly pointless and forgettable.. some panning shots are rendered as blurry messes, some scenes work better.. but not really worth the time and money to do the conversion."
"Feb 12, 2012",1.5,"Most of the movie was boring, and was not as epic as the original trilogy. The only redeeming scene was the lightsaber battle with Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul."
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"There's nothing like seeing Star Wars on the big screen. The 3d was horrible, get past the annoying Jar Jar binks, this film is some what entertaining. The pod race scene is fantastic. And the last Jedi vs. Sith duel is great, I just wish the rest of the film was just as worthy. Still, it has that Star Wars feeling, and that's what made me fall in love with the franchise as a boy."
"Feb 12, 2012",5,I don't care what anyone says.
"Feb 12, 2012",1,"Poorly converted. Very little 3D effect and unrealistic depth and dimension. One of the worst 3D conversions ever. Very disappointed. With Star Wars being so popular you would think they would work harder and make it a flawless conversion. FAIL. The poor acting and terrible dialogue doesn't help either. Who the Hell says ""Yippie!!!""????"
"Feb 12, 2012",2,Weather you love it or you hate it... The fact still stands that we have all seen and rated this movie before. The only difference is that it is now in brain curdling 3D. Quite honestly I find that with these popping visuals I still can not connect with monotone characters nor follow a baffling story line that lacks an identifiable protagonist. It's just not nearly enough to save the film for me. All I can say is that Lucas is a true businessman.
"Feb 12, 2012",2,"Var ogsÃ¥ det svageste led i Sagaen sidste gang den blev vist, og 3D-effekterne lÃ¦gger hverken til eller fra. Kun Pod-racet er helstÃ¸bt, og det er planket fra BjergkÃ¸bing Grand Prix......"
"Feb 12, 2012",2.5,"As a fellow Star Wars fanatic, I for one wasn't looking forward to this. I hate 3D with a passion and consider it a full out gimmick. The plot moves pretty damn slow for one thing. It centers around the planet of Naboo as it falls to the greedy Trade Federation forces. So Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon must save the planet with the help of a few new friends. Most of the story feels like filler and nothing happens. n fact most of the story takes place OFF of Naboo and focuses on stuff that overstays its welcome like the Pod Race and Jar Jar's antics. There's also a lack of development between the characters as well. Most of it is overshadowed by the needless things like the Senate hearing. The characters themselves aren't bad, but of course everyone knows we could've done without Jar Jar Binks. His annoyance makes me wish I could mute the movie screen every time he came on. The action scenes are well done for the most part and I enjoyed the duel with Darth Maul as well. The music is of course well done for a Star Wars movie and has memorable tunes.

All in all, this movie shouldn't have been made in 3D at all, this movie was already mediocre enough so why make it mediocre and annoying? Please do yourself a favor and go watch the original trilogy that's NOT in 3D and avoid this mess. Or if you do like the Prequels, then see them but NOT in 3D.

GRADE: C-"
"Feb 12, 2012",2,"It was pretty bad in 2d, now Lucas has added a whole other dimension of suck."
"Feb 12, 2012",2,"Sadly, only the pod race scene really benefited from the 3D effect. Large landscape shots (Coruscant, Naboo) were underwhelming."
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"This isn't a terrible film. However, the decision of scrapping models and make-up for CGI.. distanced this film from the original trilogy both chronologically and in it's impact."
"Feb 12, 2012",5,Really enjoyed this in 3-d!
"Feb 12, 2012",5,Never watched star wars before! Was very impressed :)
"Feb 12, 2012",1.5,I only went to see it to get it out of the way... Then I proceeded to The Muppets Movie
"Feb 12, 2012",1.5,"Save the time, ignore them until the Original trilogy is out."
"Feb 12, 2012",2,"George says this movie is for kids. That's why he's packed it with Galactic Trade debates, a single mom and her son being slaves, and a Sith being cut in half. Everything a child should want or need to see"
"Feb 12, 2012",1,"Not willing to give any more of my money to GL. Was not impressed with episode 1, 2 and 3. I only like the original (first) movies."
"Feb 12, 2012",4,"There is nothing wrong with The Phantom Menace. My only complaint is the kid that plays Anakin and Jar Jar Binks. I'm not a huge fan of 3D, for the most part I feel that it is a gimmick. This is the only 3D film I've seen that has noticeable 3D. If you love Star Wars and aren't one of those punks that knock everything that isn't the original trilogy, you will like it."
"Feb 12, 2012",4,"Was cool seeing it in a theatre, but the 3D wasn't perfect."
"Feb 12, 2012",4,"A good update to Star Wars. The new trilogy has really grown on me and it's great to see my son enjoying a ""his"" version of the classic saga."
"Feb 12, 2012",0.5,"Really an awful film, if it wasn't for the star wars part of the title, this film would've  just bombed, I remember i saw this when i was 10, thinking why do the jedi and sith just start fighting eachother without even talking? they didn't even acknowledge eachother as sith and jedi, just one guy was wearing black robes while the other two were wearing light brown robes,"
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"STAR WARS MOVIE REVIEW : STAR WARS I - THE PHANTOM MENACE IN 3D

(This is a special edition of the Weekly Movie Review.  In this edition I will follow the upcoming series of remastered 3D Star Wars films.  But I will be reviewing them as though Iâ(TM)ve never seen a Star Wars film and the films are being released for the very first time.)

MINI-REVIEW: Amazing special effects, flat story.

SPOILERS WITHIN!

RATING : See it in theaters (for the special effects and 3D)

Qui-Gon Jinn is Jedi Knight â"" a mystical and powerful fighter for the New Republic.  His apprentice is young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  The Jedi are aligned and imbued with the power of the Force â"" which is a power that permeates, controls, and is controlled by the wills of the Jedi.  Together they are charged with negotiating an agreement between the Trade Federation who have blockaded the small planet of Naboo.  Little do they know that the Trade Federation is but an extension of a dark figure who has designs to overthrow the Galactic Republic. But the Jedi are ambushed and they escape to Naboo below where they find that Queen Amidala has been taken captive and is being pressured to sign a treaty against her will.

On Naboo they meet Jar Jar Binks of the Gungan clan.  Jar Jar is an amphibious being with a Jamaican accent.  Together, they free Queen Amidala and the troupe escape to nearby desert planet of Tatooine.  There, they meet a young boy (Anikan Skywalker) who is âstrong with the forceâ?.  The stage is set and weâ(TM)re off!

Iâ(TM)ve heard a lot of commotion about this new movie by veteran filmmaker George Lucas (âAmerican Graffitiâ?, âRed Tailsâ?).  So I was excited about what lay before me.

My suspicions about this film were piqued when it opened with a âscrollâ? â"" a sort of text prolog that introduces the story.  Usually this implies that you need some backstory to understand what is going on.  It is a bad sign.  A good storyteller will incorporate any backstory in the body of the movie.  Another big question is why all this backstory? If it is Episode I then shouldnâ(TM)t we be starting at the beginning?  I was worried.

Overall I found the movie to be a sweeping, epic: A confusing tale of incomprehensible political intrigue, shoot-em-up action, and slap-stick comedy.  It is full of characters to keep track of with no one character taking center stage.  As such it is a tough film to follow.  The scenes take place on three planets and at least two star ships.

Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) is played with an even keel and cool that betrays the wisdom and venerability of the character.  Neeson strolls through this role effortlessly.  He is also supposed to be something of a rebel among the Jedi (who are a pretty contemplative bunch).

Ewan McGregor plays the young apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi.  This character is pretty much just a sort of âRobinâ? to Neesonâ(TM)s âBatmanâ?.  Heâ(TM)s young, brash, capable, obedient, and otherwise not involved in the movie.

Jar Jar Binks is a hapless, clumsy, CGI rendered, Jamaican amphibian who is adopted by Qui-Gon Jinn for reasons I canâ(TM)t understand.  This is quite possible the most annoying character in all of film history.  And the way he is played, borders on racist.  His behavior is reminiscent of the old Amos and Andy radio and TV Shows of the 1950s.  The guy cannot get out of his own way nor out of the way of anyone around him.  He is nothing but a liability.  I assume Jar Jar was introduced for comic relief but only managed to muddy an already murky storyline.  If Jar Jar had been removed from this film nothing would have changed and everything would have been better.  Iâ(TM)m mystified at what Lucas was thinking â"" perhaps he is planning to market the Jar Jar doll to children. But what parent would buy one?

Queen Amidala is played by the beautiful young Natalie Portman.  She spends most of the movie blithely stating that she will sign no treaty under duress.  In her other scenes she is just adorable bordering on breathtaking.  Her occasional action scenes show her as a Queen in command and able.

The young boy Anikan Skywalker is played by cherubic Jake Lloyd.  If this kidâ(TM)s job was to look cute and have no emotions, then he should get an Oscar.  Heâ(TM)s pretty much a doll baby with a nice coif.  I suspect the actor was selected so as not to steal any scenes from Neeson.  Mission accomplished.  Even the other children in the movie are incredibly bad actors.  I have no idea what the criteria were for choosing these kids â"" they would have been better as CGI.

SPOILER ALERT

The movie plods along with scene after scene of political intrigue.  There is a wonderful speeder race that looks like a futuristic Ben Hur remake.  And thereâ(TM)s some amazing sword fighting with these things called âLight Sabers.â?  Those fight scenes are worth waiting for.  They harken back to the days of swashbuckling stories of the 50â(TM)s.

The climax is a four-way battle scene on Naboo that seems to be created to appeal to three different audiences.  On the ground, the Gungans are fighting a sea of robot warriers.  In the sky, fighter pilots are attacking a huge battle station in a scene that makes âRed Tailsâ? look like a cocktail party.  In the Queenâ(TM)s castle, Amidala leads her closes allies to overtake the Trade Federation leaders in a running gun battle.  And finally, in the bowels of the castleâ(TM)s flight deck, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are fighting the very scary-looking Sith Lord Darth Maul.  Again, never has there been a more thrilling sword fight.

The movie seems to make great pains not to kill anyone.  The battles on the ground are all about killing robots.  Also, the ground battle involves Jar Jar Binks making slapstick error after error which results in him winning the day.  This seems to be aimed at the youngsters in the audience.  War without death.

In the air, young Anikan has accidentally taken off in a space fighter and blown up the battle station.  A more impossible sequence of accidents could not possibly have been imagined and it strains the limits of the willing suspension of disbelief.  This again seems to be aimed at the kiddies in the audience.

At the end of the day (and at the end of this 3-hour film) it is best not to think too hard about what is going on here.  âStar Wars: Episode I â"" The Phantom Menace in 3Dâ? is a classic serial action film.  The reasons for the action are of no consequence. What is important is the action itself.  The characters are put in positions of desperation that require acts of heroism that excite and thrill the audience.  Just like the old serials of the 1950â(TM)s.  They just donâ(TM)t make them like that anymore.  And maybe there is a reason for that.

I canâ(TM)t really recommend this movie based on its story.  I recommend that you see it for the spectacle. Donâ(TM)t try to make sense of it. Just let it wash over you and enjoy the ride.  So for a flimsy yet complicated story with the most amazing action scenes youâ(TM)ll ever see, I recommend you see it in theaters."
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"Saw the 3D version in the theater with my kids.  I was more into it this time than the first time I saw it during the original release, partly due to the fact that I experienced it with the kids.  I appreciated the filmmaking craft more this time."
"Feb 12, 2012",4,"Just as good as before, but had to keep reminding myself that it was in 3D"
"Feb 12, 2012",5,one of the best classic movies now in the magic 3D
"Feb 12, 2012",3,The 3D aspects worked well but i forgot how absolutely TERRIBLE this movie is- definitely the worst of the series
"Feb 12, 2012",5,3D was a wonderful addition!!
"Feb 12, 2012",4,"Yeah Star Wars!!! in 3D it was amazing, I liked the picture...looks like everything got restored and the pod race was incredible!!"
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"Episode I is tolerable, yet not the best in the series. JarJar Binks nearly ruins the entire movie."
"Feb 12, 2012",5,the movie was good in 3D I'm a huge Star Wars fan
"Feb 12, 2012",4,"Other than Jar-Jar, it was great!"
"Feb 12, 2012",3,3D wasn't very good.
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"Saw this movie last night with the kids. Fun to see it again since Sami had never seen it before. However, the 3D was was so minor in this movie it was hardly noticeable and did nothing to improve the movie. I expected better from Lucas. Probably better to save your money and watch it on blu-ray at home."
"Feb 12, 2012",2,"A kids film really, not what you' call adult sci-fi in that it doesn't have the pace or gravitas of the first star wars, there's too much empty caffeine fuelled techo midges (screen impossibly crammed to the gunnels with so many moving attacking thingys, it would be comical if not boring overkill), the japanese sounding baddies are comical in their stereotyping as is the chief light sabre wielding baddie and the acting is lacklustre. The original 2D version needed 3D, espcially for the race, which was the only good thing about it really, the rest bordered on being a tired and desperate parody of the original."
"Feb 12, 2012",4,Much better than I remember it. The 3d helps make this a better film. The pod race and end battle are superb.
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"The last time I saw this I had dial up Internet...its not got any worse but the 3d didn't make it any better...in fact I barely noticed any 3d at all! 

At least the worst is out of the way now and we can look good to increasingly better Star Wars movies being rereleased!"
"Feb 12, 2012",5,"Everyone knows this movie and being a big star wars fan (I see all 6 movies as a big story so this is for me the ""prologue"") and this has also always got mixed reviews (epsiode 1) but I think it's more of a age thing. I'm going to review the 3D (thats why it's been released again!) and as I thought: if your going to release a film (a old one) that was made before 3D technology came into effect it's not going to work!! Hardly any 3D worked with this it was not great or good 3D! It was like ""clash of the titans"" all over again! Will they do the other 5 stat wars movies in 3D? And should they? Unless James cameron changes my mind when he releases ""titanic"" in 3D in April I still think only movies made with 3D cameras are going to work! End of."
"Feb 12, 2012",5,"it was great to see on the big screen again... 3D effects weren't necessary for an already amazing adventure, in my opinion."
"Feb 12, 2012",3,"Was great to see on the big screen, but once again 3d doesn't deliver"
"Feb 12, 2012",3.5,"Not much 3D in this 3D version. Same old story though,"
"Feb 12, 2012",1,"what in the name of 3D was that. maybe it was just the cinema? but i could not see a thing, it was really dark, no sharpness no brightness to the image, terrible!! i went with a friend who expected to see 3D jump out at him but i tried to explain its about deoth perception these days. it would have been ok if i could have seen it. really disappointed, i think the kids enjoyed it (only reason to go) though one did fall asleep near the end. avoid at all costs."
"Feb 12, 2012",2,"Even the addition of 3D cannot help this film escape the wooden acting, plodding plot-line and unnecessary scenes and the conclusion that it will be another ten years before I make myself watch this movie again in the hopes it will get any better. Again, if you can find 'The Phantom Edit' online, do yourself the kindness of watching IT instead of this film in any format; A 3D theatrical release has done nothing to enhance is flavour beyond bland that will still leave you feeling hungry AND with a bad taste in your mouth."
"Feb 12, 2012",2,"Not worth seeing it. The 3d was barely noticeable, colours were badly washed out and the whole thing looked dark through the 3d glasses. Made the whole thing look tired and dated."
"Feb 12, 2012",0.5,It was terrible before and now its terrible in 3D.  Enough said.
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"Loses steam about half way through, the 3D wasn't enough to keep me entertained for the duration of it's 140 minute runtime."
"Feb 11, 2012",4,"After almost 13 years, the legendary series of George Lucas followed the new trend of movie industry, the 3D technology. The effects, from visuals, sounds to cinematography, are among the ceiling champions of the industry. Itâ(TM)s pretty impressive that they made such effects in the late minutes of 20th century. The conceptualized elements, the architecture of the buildings, anthromorphic designs of creatures, and blueprints of massive ships and crafts, are unimaginable and even better than that of James Cameronâ(TM)s Avatar. Behind these achievements are disappointments especially the plot. Lucas is not good with this part. There was no humor, no tone for affection, almost all scenes are dry and monotonous. The scene where Qui-Gon Jinn died, there was no music for grief or revenge. Even the pod raceâ(TM)s mode is exciting and tedious at the same time. But the applied 3D technology just made everything better, bolder and livelier, and makes R2D2 like standing beside you. If they have plans to pursue the other 5 installments in 3D conversion, then âMay the Force be with themâ?"
"Feb 11, 2012",2,"By far the worst Star Wars movie. Laughable dialogue at times. Darth Maul and the Pod racing are two of the only good things. The action sequences are cool, but the strictly dialogue scenes are pretty boring. 2/5"
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"I just wish the story line didn't suck, because the 3D is gorgeous."
"Feb 11, 2012",4,Awesome in 3D. What can I say. I'm a star wars geek :)
"Feb 11, 2012",1.5,The 3D part of movie is not that great! I wouldn't wast $10 to see it!
"Feb 11, 2012",2,"watched 30 minutes, left and watched chronicle instead."
"Feb 11, 2012",3,i will always watch star wars in the big screen even if it is the worst of the all the movies butttt the force just wasnt with the 3d effects it needed more midi chlorian
"Feb 11, 2012",0.5,Why would anyone torture themselves a second time?
"Feb 11, 2012",1.5,"Movie is as bad as you remember, and the 3d is overall very disappointing."
"Feb 11, 2012",5,well this was a great tail of strangeness the queen was great she was so brave like me i should have played the queen i would look wonderful in that outfit. I think this movie is a great family movie take the whole family i think it was dumb the long haired hippie guy died at the end he was wonderess he was the best part of the film i want to meet the hippie man some day that would be great i mean really great man peace love harmony froto baggins wait that is a different movie i think i ate to much sushi better go to bed with chicken lumps
"Feb 11, 2012",2.5,"O 3D nÃ£o Ã (C) bem o meu tipo favorito de 3D, mas ficou bem legal, nÃ£o prejudica o filme, e da uma grandiosidade aos cenÃ¡rios."
"Feb 11, 2012",2.5,Jar Jar Binks???  Really?
"Feb 11, 2012",3,I have seen this in theaters 9 times.
"Feb 11, 2012",0.5,This was by far the worse Star Wars! Ray Parks saves the movie as Darth Maul and then you kill him. That sucks! Do a Boba Fett movie
"Feb 11, 2012",5,it looks amazing in 3D...
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,come on people. How much richer do want Lucas to get. how many rehashes of star wars do we need.
"Feb 11, 2012",5,FUCK BEST FILM SERIES IN THE WORLD!!!
"Feb 11, 2012",3,Yep. Jar Jar is just as annoying in 3D.
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,"Just went all Geek and saw Episode I - 3D. 3D was OK, still cool to see Star Wars on the big screen!"
"Feb 11, 2012",3,Not bad.   The 3d was slightly noticeable.  Glad I got to see it in the theatre since i missed it the first time around.
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"Well...with Force Awakens around the corner, I gotta review the old Star Wars movies. Not as fun as expected. The Phantom Menace is notorious for being one of the most disappointing movies of all time. I did not share this opinion, as I saw it as a kid and surprisingly liked it. As I have gotten older, I lost interest in it, and upon rewatch, I can say I don't hate it. It is easily the most boring Star Wars movie, but not the worst. More like the second worst. This movie has good visual effects, a great score, and some few-and-far-between great scenes. However, the movie is plagued by stock characters, bland dialogue, uninteresting story, and extremely slow pace. There are also the racial stereotypes and...ya know...Jar Jar. There are awful things about this movie, and great things. The meddling with Star Wars backstory and ruining things that we loved in the originals (midichlorians, C-3PO built by Anakin) put a damper on the movie. Everyone gives bland performances, save for a few characters. The only truly awful performance is that of Jake Lloyd. You can't blame him for being a kid directed by George Lucas, but he's pretty bad. Ray Park's Darth Maul is the best character in the movie, and comes close to saving the third act with a phenomenal lightsaber fight. The music, specifically Duel of the Fates, is phenomenal and intense. The visuals, while some things are starting to look dated, are great. The movie isn't unwatchable, and I find myself enjoying it during many scenes (escape from Naboo, the Podrace, the final battles). There are not enough of these moments, because in between are boring dialogue scenes and unnecessary setup for the sequels. In fact, this movie isn't even entirely necessary to the franchise. You could (reluctantly) start with Attack of the Clones and you wouldn't lose much. Overall, The Phantom Menace is disappointing for a Star Wars movie, and ""meh"" as a movie in general. I find it enjoyable, but it is not very good. There are good moments, and they are good enough to make it watchable. Just barely though. 6/10"
"Feb 11, 2012",5,"http://www.7mpictures.com/inside/reviews/thephantommenace3d_review.htm

Gus and I agree with THIS guy! Had lots of fun, saw lots of folks dressed up, and loved the 3D,"
"Feb 11, 2012",5,I loved it it has alot of elements of the original star wars film similar themes and now a 3d twist i really enjoyed myself
"Feb 11, 2012",1,a diamond necklace around the neck of a bloated carcass. its pretty....but ew!
"Feb 11, 2012",4,Woohoo!! I liked it very much! It was great to see it in 3D and in the theater!
"Feb 11, 2012",1,"I never watched episodes 2 or 3 after seeing this mess. I don't think I've ever seen worse acting in my life than the fiasco that was Hayden Christensen's performance. Even Natalie Portman disappointed me. The dialogue didn't help, either. I hated it all."
"Feb 11, 2012",2.5,"Standard Release Review:
DUN DUN DUN! DUN DUN DUN! Seeing that amazing and immediatly recognizable yellow test scroll into oblivion for the first time is nothing short of remarkable. However, it's what comes after that that will make Star Wars fans across the globe cringe. Apparently, Uncle George decided to reward our years of dedicationa dn love for the franchise by releasing, 'Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.' It was the first Star wars film in over 10 years and it was long over-due. Unfortunatly, few light points in the film cannot save it for being an overall flop. Stereotypes for new characters rum the gamet, and before you send me hate comments about 'Nute Gunray's' japanese stereotype, tell me you DIDN'T see his mouth purposly not align with his dialoge. A congress knock-off that no one understood serves as a major plot point and Most of the scenes are fairly talky. We don't know why there was only one lightsaber fight, but that was obviously a HUGE dissapointment. The film tries to make-up for itself half-way with a dragging, semi-entertaining pod-race, and attempts to do so agan in the end by smushing alot of action together at once, but that only makes the movie seem that much worse and choppy. Overall, the only redeeming part of the film is the ending, yes it's decent with Qui Gon Jinn's death scene and the confrontation with Yoda, but I was only happy and excited because I got to leave the theatre. 2.3/5

3D Release Review:
Alright, 3D is tacky right? Wrong. With the amazing and gtraceful 'Hugo' making a wondeful example of 3D done right, Hollywoodis definatly not slowing down in it's stampede of 3D rereleases. 'The Phantom Menace in 3D' is the latest and this is pretty much the worst Star Wars film ever in non-tacky and subtle 3D. Now, that doesn't mean there is none. There's some, but it's not intrusive or overzeleous, so you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy seeing Jar Jar wave his tounge in 3D. That's what everyone came to see. Right? 
3D Review Score: 2.7/5"
"Feb 11, 2012",4.5,its star wars cmon if you dont like dont see. I loved it
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"Better in 3D, but still the same old Star Wars ;)"
"Feb 11, 2012",5,its was great to see it on the big screen again never gets old and 3d was good to.
"Feb 11, 2012",2,"Worst of the entire series. 3-D doesn't make it better. Knock it off already, George."
"Feb 11, 2012",4,"When people moan about how this movie does not live up to the original trilogy, they need to remember how old they were when they first saw it, then realize that if they saw ""Phantom Menace"" at that age they'd have swooned."
"Feb 11, 2012",0.5,"Let's see, I have seen this film many times, 3D at the movies sucks and is too expensive.  Why would anyone pay to see this movie or any of the other Star Wars movies in the theater again??"
"Feb 11, 2012",2,"3-D or 4-D or Holographic ,doesn't matter what version it is..... It's still a pile of crap!"
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,"Although it's confusing and seemingly geared towards youth, The Phantom Menace is technically impressive and enthralling."
"Feb 11, 2012",4,We skipped the 3D nonsense and found a 2D showing... and took the kids to see a Star Wars movie on the big screen for their 1st time ever.  Releasing these movies was a GREAT idea!!!
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"My 8-year-old loved it. I thought it was light and fluffy, and pretty to look at; not great, not bad, too silly in some places. (McGruder was right about Jar-Jar.)"
"Feb 11, 2012",3,The 3D added nothing to the experience. It was barely noticeable except in a few scenes. A total waste of money made worse because the surround sound wasn't  working in my theater. If they can't make a drastic improvement then there's no point in release the other movies.
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,Poco se nota el 3D pero agradable de ver de nuevo...
"Feb 11, 2012",3,Lucas' kingdom for an editor.
"Feb 11, 2012",2,Had a better time than I did the first time around
"Feb 11, 2012",1,"having seen the original and now seen it again in 3d I didnt really feel there was much difference than without 3d, the cgi, was not good and the film is far too long"
"Feb 11, 2012",1.5,"It's like unexpectedly running into an old lover. I remember her younger and better looking. So better avoid the temptation and don't get in bed with this one. Cherish the memory. While the movie has aged quite gracefully, and one marvels at Lucas' cinematographic vision, it is not a better movie than it was originally.  Take your teenagers, they will enjoy it, and you go somewhere else."
"Feb 11, 2012",1,Still Star Wars only pointlessly in 3d in fact was in 3d?
"Feb 11, 2012",0.5,Easily the worst movie ever made.
"Feb 11, 2012",4,"3d didn't help this like I hoped. great actors, great cgi, lucas' vision cannot solve poor dialog, but it's star wars. . ."
"Feb 11, 2012",5,"George did the 3d right.  didn't make it cheesy with stuff coming off the screen that didn't belong.  added lots of depth to the picture, made it seem like you were watching the action from a few feet away.  def worth the trip."
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,"Liked this movie when it first came out, and I still like it now but the 3D effects were disappointing."
"Feb 11, 2012",5,"15 years and still amazing movie!!
STRAIGHT"
"Feb 11, 2012",2.5,3D really nothing too special. Very little to rave about. Still the worst installment of the Saga.
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,"Although it still doesn't live up to original trilogy, it's still a s good entry in the genre, with great special affects and Liam Neeson's strong performance."
"Feb 11, 2012",1,Love the Movie! BUT THE 3D!! BLOWS! There's little to NONE! And Visually DARK!! DO NOT SEE!!!!
"Feb 11, 2012",0.5,The film was unwatchable when I saw it on DVD. I can't imagine that 3D really adds much considering it wasn't filmed with that in mind. George - ENOUGH already.
"Feb 11, 2012",0.5,I gave it a half star to be nice
"Feb 11, 2012",5,3D is not flying at you 3D.  It adds more depth and realism to the spacing of the characters in the foreground versus the background.  They did a good job.
"Feb 11, 2012",2,"While there are some redeeming qualities to Phantom Menace (the superficially exciting Podrace, the imaginative locations, the final duel against Darth Maul), this one takes the cake as easily the worst Star Wars movie. There is essentially no personality in any character voice or persona, the story is inane and difficult to follow, and, to top it off, the movie gets so booooorrrrrriiiiinnnngggg during its second half. The first half is sort of alright, but it spirals downhill into bone dry pseudo-political talk, and it's not even like we care about any characters or the plot enough to want to see it to the end. Go ahead, try to describe the personality of any of the main characters, I dare you. All the characters perform their lines with a vapid lack of energy that is near-opposite to the playful banter from the original trilogy. And yeah, Jar Jar is really annoying, but you already knew that. Seriously, you'll be fine if you skip this one and go straight to Episode II or III."
"Feb 11, 2012",3,My least favorite of the Star Wars movies. Good 3d effects.
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,"Here's another unpopular Star Wars opinion: I enjoy the prequels. As a kid I actually thought they were just as good as the originals. But now upon rewatching all the films I gotta say that while I do still enjoy the prequels overall, even I have to admit that the older I get, the more I start noticing all the problems with them. I might still enjoy them, but boy are they not as good as the original films, Episode III being the exception.

Take The Phantom Menace for example. The story and the plot I actually think are really damn good, politics and all. If you write a plot synopsis of the movie, I think it reads as pretty damn solid. The problem is that George Lucas didn't manage to write any interesting characters to place in his story. While the characters in the original trilogy aren't exactly deep or complex individuals, they're all distinctly memorable and likable personalities. In The Phantom Menace no one has any personality to speak of. They do things because the plot requires them to but I get no grasp on who any of these people are. There's potential there in for example Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan - they're set up in a way that would make possible an interesting relationship between the two. Qui-Gon for example could've been a sort of hippie, focusing on helping what Obi-Wan calls ""pathetic life forms"" and bending the rules set by the Jedi Council because he believes in compassion and helping in any way you can more than following a strict dogma. Obi-Wan then could've been painted as someone who wants to follow the rules and not get in trouble with the council because he wants to impress them, thus giving him and Qui-Gon an interesting dynamic. The potential is there because I watched the film and thought this shit up. But no, instead Lucas went for no character at all. What a waste.

As for the infamous Jar Jar, I don't hate him like most people seem to. He's not a good character by any means, but I don't mind him. I think I know what Lucas was maybe trying to do with him, but I may be completely wrong. My feeling is that among all the other more serious and contemplative characters Jar Jar is supposed to be the goofy one who has a good heart but ends up messing things up because of the way he is and does things. Kinda like Pippin in The Lord of the Rings. The difference though is that Pippin is actually a damn good and genuinely likable character. The problem with Jar Jar is that Lucas just took it way too far with him being always ""on"" to the point where it gets really old and tiring really fast.

Still, despite its problems, The Phantom Menace does have tons of great ideas in it. The plot is good, Darth Maul while underused is still one of the single coolest things ever, John Williams' score is as brilliant as ever, and the action sequences, such as the podrace and the climax, are terrific, the highlight of the movie being the three-way lightsaber battle of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan versus Darth Maul. That entire sequence is absolute perfection, and one of the greatest moments in all of Star Wars. Is the film as good as the original ones? Of course not, not even close. But is it the worst thing ever like so many Star Wars fans would have you believe? No, absolutely not. The plot is great and has tons of great ideas in it - it's just the script that blows. Had Lucas had a co-writer to write better characters and dialogue based on his story idea, this could've been an amazing film. As is it's just alright. But better characters and more screentime for Darth Maul could've fixed that right up. That hardly qualifies the film as the piece of shit everyone makes it out to be.

7/10"
"Feb 11, 2012",1.5,"Bad bad bad acting, except from McGregor and Neeson. The lightsaber duels are very interesting, but I cannot fathom how Lucas thought a trade war was an interesting plot device."
"Feb 11, 2012",4.5,"Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace's Re-release in 3D is what you would expect. You get a solid movie (which you probably already have seen) with some really well done 3D cinematography added to it. Now, I am not 100% sure, but there were some extra things in this version that I do not remember in the DVD version. I am not sure if it's just because it's been a while since I cracked open my SWEI DVD that I forgot some of the scenes, or if the 3D made it pop out more, or if Lucasfilms just added a few extended scenes in. You be the judge. I will have to watch it again at home, and see if they are added or if I am going crazy. All in all, I think it's a ""MUST GO"" see if you are a SW fan, a ""GO"" see if you kinda are a SW fan, or if you never have seen SW but want to, and a ""so-so"" movie if you just are in it for the 3D sci-fi action.

Gordon~"
"Feb 11, 2012",3,Watching episode I is a testament to how awesome the original trilogy is. The fight scene with Darth Maul at the end kept this from being a 2 star movie in my book. Jar Jar FTL.
"Feb 11, 2012",1.5,It was just...disappointing.
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" may not be the best Star Wars movie by a long shot, but it's no ""Attack of the Clones."""
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"it had 61% last week now, thanks to George Lucas refreshing the critics', minds with it in 3D, its sank even lower to a rotten 57% ah well your loss Mr Lucas"
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"Its not a wretched piece of cinema like those butthurt fanboys proclaim it to be. Its just not as good as the original. But it is an above average science fiction fantasy film that has strong performances from Liam Neeson and Pernilla August, as well as an iconic duel."
"Feb 11, 2012",0.5,"This was the biggest letdown when I first saw it. I decided to give it another try. I liked it more but the things I hated I still hated.
Jar jar binks is awful, but you knew that.
Jake Lloyd is terrible.
The promising villain was disappointing.
The pod race was not as good as the chariot race in Ben hur.

Skip it. You are welcome."
"Feb 11, 2012",4,"The movie is exactly the same as the original Star Wars Episode 1, but this time it's in 3D and I was surprised on how good it was. Sadly not all parts were in 3D, but when it came to the most important parts like the Pod Race, Jedi Conflict between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jin, to other action/thrilling parts of the movie. This movie brought great childhood memories as I can remember being obsessed with Star Wars and this movie just did the trick and made me walk out smiling and having something to talk about the next day. It's a must see for all Star Wars fans, and even to the ones that have never seen it, this will be a new experience."
"Feb 11, 2012",2,"It's still an amazing movie, but the 3D not so good."
"Feb 11, 2012",0.5,"If you haven't seen Red Letter Media's ""Plinkett"" review of Episode 1 yet, treat yourself. It says more than I could ever hope to in a manner much funnier than I could ever muster.

That aside the 3D effects were definitely well done and the pod-race felt like a whole new movie. See it if you've got money to burn, otherwise pass."
"Feb 11, 2012",2.5,Meh not really three d enough
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,Phantom Menace was even better in Real 3D.  I saw in on 42nd street at Midnight and was in line with so many other Fans.  Thank you Mr. LUCAS for giving the over priced theaters something to look forward too.
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"So...""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace""; The most hated, despised and ridiculed film in the entire Star Wars franchise for countless reasons, and I would be lying if I said I understand why. Ok I do understand why older fans hate this movie, but for some odd reason it doesn't bother me as much as it should.

I was six when I saw the original trilogy (in the form of the special editions no less) and I didn't understand anything outside of the creatures and action scenes. Then ""The Phantom Menace"" comes out two years later while ""Star Wars"" is still new to me, and I fell in love with it for the same reasons I fell in love with the original trilogy. However as the prequels got increasingly better and I started loving the original trilogy for more then just the special effects, this movie a decreased overtime. So with this 3D re-release I originally wasn't planning on seeing it; however a friend of mine (who I think is turning into a bigger Star Wars nerd then me...you know who you are) invited me to go with him to see it and I figured ""why the hell not?"". So I watched it after a full decade with and adult mind set and from the eyes of both a Star Wars fan and a film buff. I did end up liking it but it doesn't hold up as well as it did.

The problems I had with this movie are something to complain about, but I probably don't hold a grudge to the level older fans do. The acting isn't all that great, but it's also not as horrible as people say it is. For people like Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor they're both passable. They're good in some scenes and then in others they range from ok to bad. Natalie Portman is bland but at the same time there was never a point where I wanted to claw my eyes out and it makes me so happy that she's become the great actress that she is today. Now if you want to talk about eye clawing performances...two words...JAKE LLOYD. I FUCKING HATE THAT LITTLE BRAT. Yes I know he's probably my age or older, but I'm surprised that he didn't completely kill this movie for me or the space battle near the end. There is no tone in his voice, he can't cry or make other facial expression and if we are going to buy the idea that this kid is going to be Darth Vader...I never got that impression at all, even when I was a kid watching this in 1999 I never thought that this kid was going to end up being Darth Vader. Luckily Hayden Christensen did convince me in Episodes II and III. Why? Well that's another review for another prequel. All the other actors did a passable job also. Another problem I have is the script. For being the film to kick off the whole saga, it didn't tell us anything we didn't know from in the original trilogy and some of the dialogue is painful to listen to, especially from Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd.

I know I should probably mention Jar Jar Binks, but honestly I don't hold him to the hate that others do and I also never thought I'd find myself in a position to defend him ever, but in comparison to two characters created in a similar manner I have to. Those characters are Skids and Mudflap from ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"". Jar Jar can be very annoying at times, and he does do stupid things here and there, however most of the time he stands in a corner not saying a word and he can be helpful at times. He leads the two Jedi to the lost Gungan city, he act's as their navigator though the planet core (even though we don't see any), he tells the queen that the Gungans have and army which gives her the idea to return to Naboo and fight and during that battle he does have the brains to destroy a few battle droid, a droideka and an AAT. Then you bring in Skids and Mudflap, who don't do anything but make horrible jokes they don't kill a single Decepticon they practically act invisible to Optimus Prime, and they just look like the most retarded things I've ever seen in terms of design. I know Jar Jar does look ridiculous, but he's an alien so you can excuse that and an original creation, where as Skids and Mudflaps look nothing like their original toy counterparts. I know people criticize Jar Jar for his voice being racist, but it's how his entire spices talks which is fine. With S&amp;M it's obvious that they were made to be the worst black stereotypes imaginable. Also George Lucas was smart enough not to put a scene where we think Jar Jar is dead but it turns out he isn't (similar to what Michael Bay did) and he was smart enough to have Jar Jar appear here and there in Episode II for continuity sake, unlike S&amp;M who just disappeared from ""Dark of the Moon"" completely without any mention. The only problem I have with Jar Jar is that he's over animated, when compared to Sebulba, Watoo, and the battle droids. Jar Jar looks too rubbery. However unlike Skids and Mudflap, he blended into the environment and didn't look bad in terms of interacting with the actors. Now for as much as I kinda like Jar Jar, I still get a joy out of making fun of him just like every other Star Wars fan.

So what do I like about this movie? Well there's a lot of eye candy and enough cool action to make me forgive the elements that people hate. I also love how the prequels expand on the entire Star Wars universe, it gives us more planets, creatures, machines, technology and vehicles. I enjoyed the pod race, the action scene when Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are on the droid control ship and the last thirty minutes was pretty impressive. All of that was enough to make me forgive most of the acting and the flaws in the script. Speaking of the script I honest like how they needed to show the return of the Sith, how Palpatine starts his rise in power and it was cute seeing C-3PO and R2-D2 meet for the first time. Another thing that saved the movie was...you guessed it...John Williams score. While it's not as powerful as the music from the original trilogy, it's still epic and that man can do no wrong.

I do like the movie but don't expect me to defend it because I won't. If you love the movie that's fine, but if you hate it that's fine also, but calling the best or worst movie ever made isn't true at all. The original trilogy will always be the better films and we have the Michael Bay ""Transformers"" and ""The Twilight Saga"" which have no memorable characters, dialogue worse then in this movie, and it makes you angry that those things not only got made, but that they're incredibly successful.

(Notes on Blu-ray changes and the 3D): With the exception of the pod race, the space battle and the journey through Naboo's planet core, the 3D was kind of pointless. As for the changes made for the Blu-ray release, they make the movie slightly better then when it first came out. The CGI Yoda look good because that original puppet version never looked right, even when I saw it in 1999. Some other things were fixed that are actually acceptable. So it looks like the prints used for each Star Wars 3D rerelease will be the Blu-ray versions, which makes me nervous about the ""nnnnnnooooooooooo"" scene in ""Return of the Jedi"", but I'm still gonna see it anyway."
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,"I hear the 3D adaptation isn't too wonderful however it'd be great to see the movie on the big screen again. I always like to get my own idea, besides one man's trash is another's great film."
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,"liked the old ones better, but this was the best new aniken, man hayden christensen is a bad actor"
"Feb 11, 2012",4,"It's not impressive like the other films, but Star Wars Episode I (in 3D) is worth the watch."
"Feb 11, 2012",1.5,This movie ruined my Star Wars childhood dreams... so not much has change it still sucks fancy 3-d and all.
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,"People need to stop ragging on Jar Jar and look at the great things in this film. Namely the final light-saber battle. the pod race, any scene with Yoda and the other Jedi Masters. Also Qui Gon Jin is one of Liam Neeson's best roles. Not a perfect movie but nowhere near as bad as some people make it out to be."
"Feb 11, 2012",5,loved it from star to finish although It could of done without that jar jar binks..
"Feb 11, 2012",3,"Good to see Star Wars on the big screen, but the 3D was not impressive at all. The best 3D Ive seen was Avatar and Hugo.."
"Feb 11, 2012",0.5,the worst movie ever in the star wars series
"Feb 11, 2012",5,"Not only did the 3D not make the movie feel gimmicky, it actually added to the overall movie experience."
"Feb 11, 2012",2,"The movie that represents ""anticipointment"" in many, in hindsight is not so terrible....but still pretty bad. The stunning action sequences in 3D, especially for a 15-year old movie, but when they start to get onto a ""talky"" part, you just want to fall asleep"
"Feb 11, 2012",2,This was a ok movie but doesn't deserve more then that..
"Feb 11, 2012",4,I thought this was a good movie  but not as good as the other movies
"Feb 11, 2012",2,Though nowhere near my favorite of the saga it's still Star Wars and if you thought I wasn't going to see this in the theater well... DUH!
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,"Podrace, Battle of Naboo and Darth Maul kicking ass in 3D is worth suffering through the clunky dialogue and of course...Jar Jar Binks."
"Feb 11, 2012",4,Not good in 3D. Not as good second time in theater. Long wait for battle scene.
"Feb 11, 2012",2.5,"The theater had the sound too low and the screen should've been brighter. Still a pretty bad movie in 3D, but Darth Maul makes up for it."
"Feb 11, 2012",2,"I broke down and went to the 3D money grab with friends.  I had forgotten all the good part in the critical bashing this filled got.  It's really a great epic adventure if you can just accept a few crappy lines of dialog and JarJar.  The 3D wasn't needed, but it was fun to be in an audience where pre-teens are seeing Star Wars on the big screen for the first time."
"Feb 11, 2012",3,This's  movie is make from 2D first so the effect on 3D is not good
"Feb 11, 2012",3.5,Awesome to see it again on the big screen! The pod-racer scene had the best 3D ever! Followed by the final lightsaber scene!
"Feb 11, 2012",4.5,It looks great In 3D!!
"Feb 11, 2012",2,"This is a review for the re-released 3D version.  After experiencing the wow factor of films like ""Avatar"" or even ""Transformers 3"" in 3D,  the very processed look of ""Phantom Menace"" is mostly underwhelming.  You can tell especially when a character moves quickly,  it looks like it has been broken down into individual cutout still photos.  The outlines of the characters aren't smooth.  Many times I swear I could see black outlines that resembled the tell-tale matte lines from yesteryear.  For it's time,  the amazing amount of detail in the background was groundbreaking.  But the story, and especially George Lucas' tone deaf directing, left little else to embrace.  It sadly does not seem to age well over time, in comparison to the still excellent original Star Wars trilogy.   Probably the best 3D is during the pod race sequence.  Otherwise, you can see the rough edges when attemtping to add depth to a shot.  Things like smoke don't translate well.  

So adding 3D does little to enhance the glitzy effects, and the story and wooden line delivery are still painful to watch.  Perhaps one could justify still attending a 3D screening in a movie theatre to get a chance to admire the background."
"Feb 11, 2012",2,"As a huge fan, I was dissapointed with the 3D hype. Expected the pod race to be excellent but ....."
"Feb 11, 2012",5,"Profoundly appreciative of the craftsmanship and respect paid to the re-mastering of one of the great films of my childhood - Star Wars Episode I. 

Nostalgic bias aside, this movie was beautifully done. Can't wait to own the series in 3d."
"Feb 10, 2012",1,"Dude this is a stupid cartoon made for toddlers. I hate fake Star War movies. Where is Luke, Han, and Leia and the Galactic Rebellion."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"Phantom Menace is my least favorite of the SW saga, but its still SW and i paid my $10 to see it in 3D.  Only scene that was worth it being in 3D was the podracing scene.  Would prefer they did the order they came out instead of numerical order, but oh well.  Lucas needs to make the Thrawn Trilogy already....or another director needs to step up.  May the Force be with us all!!"
"Feb 10, 2012",2.5,"Ok. Entertaining. 3D was done cleanly. Jar Jar Binks detracted a lot from the 2D version and takes away one more dimension here. Nice theological undertones, though, to story. ""The capital [planet] is one big city."""
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"I'm always torn by Episode I. It's Star Wars, and I love Star Wars. But it always feels like a poor imitation of the real thing. I love how the Expanded Universe makes Episode I less bad in theory - developing back story to explain the weak plot and turning some of the characters into more cool versions of themselves... But Episode I on its own kind of sucks. Sadly, 3D didn't make it that much better."
"Feb 10, 2012",2.5,Man not sure if the little 3D could help this out but somehow Jar Jar was entertaining in #thephantommenace
"Feb 10, 2012",2,"Great ideas, horrible implementation.  It's like Mr. Lucas has no one to disagree with him anymore.  Too silly, too focused on the wrong things, too many bad elements.  Here's what I would have suggested:

1. Get rid of Jar-Jar
2. Anakin should have been near Amidala's age, get the romance cooking, instead, they wasted a whole movie with nothing but an awkward line: ""I care for you.""
3. No pointless pod race, or a much much shorter one.
4.  No Gungans.
5.  Anakin actually saves Naboo by intentionally flying a space craft and intentionally doing something that saves the day.
6. Don't kill off Darth Maul.  He was one of the best elements.

In my perfect dream world, Darth Maul is saved for the final film.  In the end, there is a climactic battle with Anakin and Darth Maul.  Perhaps Darth Maul mortally wounded Padme.  Anakin, thinking her dead, goes a little crazy and attacks Maul.  This would parallel Return of the Jedi where Luke fights his father, only, instead of choosing not to kill him, and thus staying on the light side, Anakin fails and kills Maul, taking him completely to the dark side.  

Then, it would make sense why he might join the Emperor.  The way it is now, he just makes an error in judgement and then is like, ""Oh, snap!  I guess I might as well slaughter the younglings.""  What the heck, Lucas?!  I feel like you weren't even trying.

However, I would not be mad if you decided to remake Episodes I-III.  Just do them right.  You can even use my suggestions, free of charge."
"Feb 10, 2012",1,This is a dumb movie and you are dumb if you like it sorry
"Feb 10, 2012",3.5,"People may complain about the plot, lack of character development, and Jar Jar Binks.......but I rate this so high because does its job well, which is to entertain its crowd and to introduce newcomers to a whole universe. In other words, its perfectly fine as a prologue to the Star Wars saga."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"As Star Wars goes it's not the best but...sometimes I have to think ""I'm 7 again and this is the coolest ever""...but reality sets in and I know the acting is bad and George can't direct himself out of a bag...Either way I took the family to see it tonight and we had a good time. I still enjoy the lightsaber fight at the end of the movie."
"Feb 10, 2012",1,"Rough dialogue, terrible acting, and Jar Jar ruins this movie. Sith fight at end is tight though."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"First off the 3d was mostly disappointing, it looked good at times, the pod race etc. but most of the movie it was barley noticeable. Seeing as this was the main reason for the re-release it seems odd. As for the movie everyone had already seen it. The pod race and lightsaber battles are great but not much else. The trade and diplomacy plot seems even more ridiculous and out of place as ever. Jar Jar Binks is ridiculous but seems to be on screen way more then he should. Sure there can be a goofy sidekick but they seem to stick him in scenes that don't need any comic relief and these ruin the flow and tone of the film.The film is still star wars, and enjoyable but the plot seems lazy and the Gungan aliens (Jar Jar's tribe) ruin the movie with terrible dialogue and accents and lame fighting. Probably best to pass on the first three films going to be released and wait until the original trilogy comes to theaters, if only to see how a 70's movie converts to 3d."
"Feb 10, 2012",5,"I mean as an avid star wars fan I was so pumped when I saw the preview on screen.... You can never get better than sitting in the theater watching pod races, light saber battles, and space battles on a massive screen in 3D with surround sound..... Loved it and I will spend every dime to see them all again in 3D"
"Feb 10, 2012",0.5,I would give this zero stars if I could.
"Feb 10, 2012",3,its pretty good in 3d
"Feb 10, 2012",2,"Somehow exactly what i was expecting, no more no less. . ."
"Feb 10, 2012",3.5,Not that much 3d but I saw it when i was a kid and it still an okay movie jar jar is dumb as can be the pod race is awesome and so is the saber fight. Looks really good on a big screen.
"Feb 10, 2012",2,Meh. Probably my least favorite Star Wars (yes even more than Attack of the Clones) but if your gonna see it skip 3D and just rent it.
"Feb 10, 2012",3.5,I've enjoyed watching it many times since its been out and found it hard to believe that someone couldn't be entertained by such a epic sci fi.
"Feb 10, 2012",2.5,"Oh...now I see it, it's mostly exposition. It's surprising how much this movie doesn't hold up. The dialog, acting, and story are all weaknesses, but the design and the set pieces are stunning. I really enjoyed the 3D, especially the opening scroll and the scenes on Courascant. One down, 5 (better ones) to go."
"Feb 10, 2012",2.5,"It's nowhere near as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Is it the one of the worst films ever? Not even close? Is it the best Star Wars film. Same answer. There are some entertaining moments sprinkled throughout the film. The PodRace and the lightsaber still hold up for a CGI heavy film from 1999. That being said, the effects of the time show their age 16 years later. The acting one of the film's biggest weaknesses with the exception of Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, who is my favorite character in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Ewan McGregor is also good in the film despite the fact that he's barely in the film. (Does this one even have a main character?). There is an equal portion of great moments and bad moments; endearing ideas and terrible ideas (JarJar). It may very well be the weakest film in the saga, but, in the end, Episode I: The Phantom Menace is still a part of the universe that, to this day, is still close to everyone's heart. 5/10."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"Fun to watch on the big screen again, but why oh why did the waste money on the ""3D?"" Just release them for the fans and save your money, Lucasfilms."
"Feb 10, 2012",2,"still lame, even in a fake 3D (but have the best saber duel, though)"
"Feb 10, 2012",5,Nicely reworked and cleaned up.. Loved it back then and still love it today..
"Feb 10, 2012",1.5,A pile of shit in 3D is still just a pile of shit ... just more expensive. The 3D conversion looks good so I'm looking forward to seeing the original trilogy in 3D.
"Feb 10, 2012",3.5,Probably the best light-sabre fight in any of the Star Wars movies.
"Feb 10, 2012",3.5,I love star wars even the new trilogy. But the 3D was the best 3D. I did like seeing it in theater again though.
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"If this were to have been the first Star Wars movie, I don't think they could have funded the other films, because the plot wouldn't have been enough to capture such a vast fanbase. However, it sets up the worlds of Star Wars beautifully, providing lots of eye candy, and the Darth Maul/Qui-Gon fight scene is the definition of epic."
"Feb 10, 2012",4,It's......Star Wars. Why would it get anything less than at least 80%? I mean......it's Star Wars.
"Feb 10, 2012",2.5,3D was not that impressive!  Weakest of the Star Wars movies!
"Feb 10, 2012",3,If it wasn't for Darth Maul I would probably hate this movie. I wish I had found the fan version that was done that deleted Jar Jar Binks from the film. That would've been interesting to see.
"Feb 10, 2012",5,"Whether people like it or not, or if it is true to its history or whatever, I love it and so does my kid. Everyone needs to stop whining about ""back in my day"" versions of the movies..."
"Feb 10, 2012",1.5,"slow-motion action! Jedi knights that don't know how to swing a laser sword properly (no martial arts training and choreography). Barely 2 hours worth of material stretched to 3 tedious hours, lame dialog, stiff acting by bunch of otherwise good actors casted poorly (especially Sam Jackson, gees).. annoying Jar-Jar, lots of character racial stereotypes.. No funny jokes.. Even some of the special effects are bad, especially the fake transparent vapors.. 3D conversion was OK. A bit blurry. 

But for a moment, it brought me to my early childhood. That's unfortunately the only value I saw in it. Quit directing movies, George."
"Feb 10, 2012",1.5,Complete and utter waste of time. Only 2 sequences in this entire film were remotely 3D - the rest was barely noticeable and looked as if I was simply watching the normal Blu-ray version. Do NOT waste your time and money. (This score is for the 3D only; score for the film itself: 2.5/5)
"Feb 10, 2012",4,Star Wars being one of the most famous and award acclaimed saga is a must see for everyone!

"Feb 10, 2012",5,slow moving but can't go wrong. all I can say is has George Lucas ever made a movie that wasent good?
"Feb 10, 2012",3.5,re-view. this 3d movie was a waste of money! hardley any cool 3d parts...big disapointment
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"If I may speak in ""Yoda"" slang: ""one annoying character, a bad film does not equal..."" The same goes for a trendy gimmick that is only sufficiently useful for one third of the film, if THAT. Still, the action scenes are very good and the flow of the film is adequate. This one is for the fans!"
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"Did you like the pod race scene of Episode I? Oh, you didn't? Well, then just watch the movie on DVD. The only redeeming quality of this 3D movie is the pod race. Otherwise, it's more or less the same movie from 1999. With any luck, George Lucas won't be quite so frugal with the 3D conversion of the next five. On the other hand, it was nice to see it in theaters again."
"Feb 10, 2012",2.5,"Rewatching The Phantom Menace in 3D is a fair reminder of just why it's my least favorite in the entire series.  For all its exposition and slapstick, Episode I is strangely short on meaningful information and humor.  As uneven a film as I've ever seen, Episode I just doesn't know when to be strckly serious and when it should make its vaguery attempts at humor.  It's interesting that with such a finely assembled cast a director such as Lucas can produce performances that remain lifeless from start to finish.  

Far from an abject failure, what was good before is made better with the 3D makeover.  Along with that eye popping FX, an absolutely beautiful score and Darth Maul make this flick worth seeing.  

If you think of Star Wars as a puzzle, consider this the side pieces that you purfunctorily put together first.  Not as rewarding as the center, but it does help to complete the picture."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"OK, yes, there is the fact that PHANTOM MENACE ranks 5th in the pecking order of all Star Wars films, ahead of only ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  There is the horrendously cheesy dialogue.  There is also the fact that damn near anyone could sit down for half an hour with a pad and paper with the charge of coming up with the backstory to the masterful original Star Wars trilogy and do a better job.  And there's Jar Jar.  But, I managed to get off work on a Friday that wasn't my custody weekend, get my 4-year old daughter from school and take her to this before I had to give her up for the weekend, and she loved it.  

THE PHANTOM MENACE is far from perfect, but the final fight with Darth Maul, the pod race, the ADDED-BACK SCENES! and the fact it's STAR WARS, plus the presence of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor make this a 3 star film.  It isn't good, but it is a film worth seeing, no matter what.  And it fulfills its intention: appealing to young and old alike, no matter if you're here or in a galaxy far, far away."
"Feb 10, 2012",5,OMG. The light saber and space battles were awesome in 3D. I cannot wait for Empire and Return to come out. Thank you Mr Lucas !
"Feb 10, 2012",5,tengo que verla en 3D
"Feb 10, 2012",1,"I Wasted $16 on a 3d movie that was less than impressive. i own the movie on bluray, and sadly it has better effects than this sad excuse of a re-release"
"Feb 10, 2012",2,"The 3D helped, but it was still just a terrible movie."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"Same fairly lame movie, certainly not my favorite Star Wars movie, but I was pretty excited to see it in 3D, however the 3D part was pretty pointless."
"Feb 10, 2012",5,"Taking my son to see it tonight, his first time seeing it on the big screen."
"Feb 10, 2012",0.5,"Sorry George no one's buying your ""I'm changeing it because with this new technique it's better"" line anymore. You are patently trying to sqeeze yet more money out of a property that you quite clearly do not really give a damn about... Which incidentally neither do I."
"Feb 10, 2012",5,"it was great to drop my money on a big movie that is eye candy, the stereo(3d) was great and the movie looks great! i loved paying to see a movie thats all fantasy! this is why i love movies to take me out of my everyday life. also it was the fact my kids have never seen these movies on the big screen. (3yr n' 5yr) if you want to go see a great kids movie this is it!....... btw if your a cynical 40 year old wondering why movies are different than when you were a kid in the 70's this is'nt the film for you. I DON'T THINK A SINGLE CHILD WOULD NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE IT'S FUN TO WATCH"
"Feb 10, 2012",1.5,"You are better off watching this movie at home! The graphics could have been way better, especially with all the money that George Lucas has!"
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"Worst of the epic saga but still has it's CGI epicness and the Lightsaber duel between Darth Maul and Obi-Wan Kenobi/Qui-Gon Jinn was great, and the Pod Race on Tatooine was pretty cool too. Critics and nit-pickers can all go to hell, it's still Star Wars, a**holes."
"Feb 10, 2012",5,Awesome Classic! Even Better to Bring it Back in 3D!!!!!
"Feb 10, 2012",2,"Pourrait contenir des gÃ¢cheux.

"Feb 10, 2012",3,3d sucked worst star wars movie fuck u jar jar i love darth maul he is so awesome the pod race was cool
"Feb 10, 2012",2.5,"The Phantom Menace is a disappointment and all around smack in the face to the fans of Star Wars who have grown to love this series. Overall The Phantom has a cheesy and tastless story and character delvopment to it that it makes the auidence ashamed to be a fan of star wars and the only reason why this film is somewhat decsent is due to Liam Neeson and his performance, but even he cant save this series from its own tasteless efforts."
"Feb 10, 2012",4,"Awww come on' rotten tomatos! This movie deserves a higher ranking. So what if the muppet style characters take a lot away from the coolness of this classic, the plot stays the same! and not only that..one of the coolest and most badass characters in Star Wars history is introduced in this episode. Don't want to spoil the plot, but if only some characters had stuck around, I would've easily given this movie five stars!! MUST SEE AGAIN!! if you don't, then you're just not a Star Wars fan."
"Feb 10, 2012",2.5,This is movie wasn't very 3d it is like some of the 3ds games were it is only depth of field and no eye popping explosions i love star wars but do not pay for 3d not worth the money. But the re imaging into full HD was wonderful light sabers were more vivid to see like eps 3 but better wonder what they could do to eps 3 quality.
"Feb 10, 2012",3,As bad as Jar Jar is and as bad as some of Te dialogue goes... It's still fucking Star Wars and Darth Maul has to one of the best villains ever!!!
"Feb 10, 2012",5,Amazing that they rerelease. Jedis and Siths alike rejoice.
"Feb 10, 2012",0.5,Sacroonie Doughpot Slame-O! Find out what Midichlorians are in STUNNING 3D!!!!
"Feb 10, 2012",0.5,"3D makes star wars  suck, bit of a dissapointment."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"Some classic Star Wars elements are preserved, such as characters, esthetics, and some references to the classic films, but truth is, the film's progression becomes a problem when it's not focused on the action, and while it develops a certain feeling of improvement, the low paced story and uninteresting new characters helps create a sense of boredom in what otherwise should be a straight forward imaginatively entertaining adventure."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"At the end of the day, it's still Star Wars."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"Fan Boys need to get over themselves, This film is not that bad. Go watch The Room if you think this is bad."
"Feb 10, 2012",2,"No matter how much you polish a turd, it's still a turd. This film has terrible acting with the exception of the 3 big stars; Portman, McGregor, and Neeson. The script is sophomoric and lacks a soul. Jar-jar is an arguably racist character offering no redeeming comedic value. 

Don't encourage Lucas. Go watch something else; anything else. Go see Chronicle this weekend if you want to see some Jedi powers. I'm sure the ""terd"" dimension will add nothing but consumer remorse after paying the high prices ticket.

If you have children that haven't seen these, you get a pass. 

Poop I say. This is all poop."
"Feb 10, 2012",1.5,"Ya can't Polish a turd, as so many others have stated/said,.................."
"Feb 10, 2012",1.5,"A sad a nd deplorable waste of life, money and energy."
"Feb 10, 2012",4,"If only they kept Darth Maul in all the movies...
Darth Maul rules."
"Feb 10, 2012",1,Shit film in 3D. Whoop dee do
"Feb 10, 2012",0.5,"Lucas needs to tie a rope around Jar Jar's neck really tight and watch this character slowly lose the air out of its lungs cause it single handedly killed this episode. Maybe with the newly open slot they can add another Darth Maul cause this character rulz!
Then and only then will I spend the hefty amount of deniro to watch this in 3-D.
That is all..."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,I used to love this movie then I took a trip a long driving trip with a person who had to recites every word of each movie did I say it was a long trip O.M.G! the plot is good but if I never hear the movie again I am good with that.
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"Saw this at midnight, wasn't too too impressed. The movie itself, in my opinion, is the worst in the series, but the 3D conversion is actually pretty well done - especially the pod racing and epic battle scenes. Other than that, however, the 3D is used to add an extra 'layer' of depth, which worked for the most part. If you are a moderate-to-diehard fan of Star Wars, and love technical eye candy, see this - otherwise, avoid."
"Feb 10, 2012",1,"Why I went to see this tripe is beyond me.  Trust me when I say I won't make the same mistake with ""Attack of the Clones"""
"Feb 10, 2012",5,"I've been a huge fan of Star Wars from the beginning, but I have to admit the same as most fans feel about Episode I: The Phantom Menace... it didn't have the same heart as IV, V, and VI.  However, I just had to experience it again in 3D in IMAX (or in my particular venue of choice, which showed in in XD Digital)... and I'm glad I did.

It felt a lot faster and more enjoyable this time around, and maybe that's because there's been enough time since it's first release, to appreciate and have affection for the actors (whom are mostly household names now), and their characters.  I also have a lot more clarity for the complete storyline now, having lived all six episodes and let them sink in for a dozen or more years.

As far as the 3D experience, considering the original wasn't made for 3D, and there's no gimmicky in-your-face gotcha's...the process helped give the film a richer depth of field without looking 'layered' on purpose, like so many 3D gimmicky films do. George's people made it feel real. And the pod-race scene and space battles were worth the extra 3 bucks, for sure!  The ploan is to big-screen all 6 eps in 3D, now...and I will definitely be there for 'em all!"
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"Some pointless scenes, Lloyd's terrible acting, and Jar Jar's existence mar what is otherwise a decent beginning to the Star Wars saga and arguably the best of the prequel trilogy."
"Feb 10, 2012",4,"Although this is not my favorite episode of Star Wars, and although I want to kill Jar Jar every time I see him, it was fun to see this film enhanced with 3D.  Yes, the 3D makes a difference â"" among other things, it makes the pod race even more funâ¦"
"Feb 10, 2012",0.5,"Wasted enough time, money, and tears on this pile already, and Lucas' 3D is abysmal."
"Feb 10, 2012",3,"Definitely a lot of dazzling special effects, but it's very lazy on story and character development.

Note: The 3D wasn't very impressive."
"Feb 10, 2012",1.5,Bringing these movies back to the theatre just brings back memories of extreme sadness and disappointment. I don't want to be reminded of how one my childhood joys was almost utterly destroyed by not one but three horrible movies.
"Feb 09, 2012",2.5,"One o the few people who don't mind this one, although the pod racing goes on slightly to long. Maul should not have been killed and used in place of Dooku in the next two. Very disappointed with the conversion here though. 
The 3D is poor and flat and is a waste of time but this also makes the picture quality severely reduced and sound is flat and lifeless. I was really looking forward to this but turned out to be a waste of money. Best just to watch them on Blu-Ray with exceptional picture quality and sound"
"Feb 09, 2012",0.5,No heart...No Story...No Merit.
"Feb 09, 2012",3.5,Love this movie ! Darth Maul was a bad ass wish he hadn't gotten offed!
"Feb 09, 2012",0.5,Stop giving George Lucas money
"Feb 09, 2012",4,"Even through the greatness of this episode, the 3D conversion still didn't live up to George Lucas' words."
"Feb 09, 2012",0.5,"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie many years ago. I got goosebumps. I then saw this movie many years ago......uh, what were we talking about?"
"Feb 09, 2012",3,"Although it's the worst movie of the saga, the pod race, the Darth Maul fight and the space battle makes it all worth it, specially in 3D."
"Feb 09, 2012",4,"Held to an unfair standard, one that never really existed.  The original 3 were more hokey then people recall.  You have to go into this movie with the eyes of youth and let your imagination take control, rather than judging with your critical eye.  

Sure, Jar Jar is lame.  Maybe the story isn't as compelling, but Liam and Ewen carry this one.  Also seldom mentioned: lightsaber scenes in the new movies are much better than the originals."
"Feb 09, 2012",4,"Just saw in 3D. I still fell asleep in the pod race but it was worth it for the final 15 min. The 3D really does make the CGI look awesomely real. And still at the end you don't want to watch ""Phantom"" again but it does make you want to watch the next one, which I most def will."
"Feb 09, 2012",0.5,any theatre that shows it should be shut down
"Feb 09, 2012",1,The only redeeming part of this movie is the presence of Darth Maul and the Lightsaber battle at the end... Ray Park was the Phantom Menace.... every other seen is crap.  Poor story telling that looks aesthetically pleasing.   3D can't enhance the acting or story to make this movie any better.
"Feb 09, 2012",5,Can't wait to see this in 3D!
"Feb 09, 2012",3,"Not my favorite, but I'm a Star Wars nut so I have to see it in 3D. I hope the pod race is bearable now."
"Feb 09, 2012",5,Definitely seeing this hahaha
"Feb 09, 2012",2.5,"There are so many movies where opinion is split down the middle, and this movie is a prime example. Many enjoyed it, thought it was a fitting entry into the famous and loved Star Wars Saga, and others thought it was awful, shallow, and hollow. Where am I? I don't absolutely hate this movie, that's for sure, but it's should've been so much better. People blame the high expectations set by the original trilogy (understandable... they're some of the greatest movies ever made), but in all honesty, this is just a poor movie, be it Star Wars or not. Poor acting, a one dimensional plot, and cringe-worthy dialogue ridicule this entire thing. There is not one likeable character, the acting is wooden, and Darth Maul is such a one-note villain I often forget he exists... The kid who plays Anakin is GODAWFUL. No kid says YIPPEEE. Jar Jar Binks is stupid and worthless. The droid humor (or any attempted humor in general) is flat. This is really sad, considering George Lucas's talents. 

Now, while I've started off the review negatively, there is still some good to this movie. The visuals are fantastic, and they still look amazing 13 years later. And even if dialogue and acting sucks, we get some pretty sweet action sequences. If Lucas can't direct a drama anymore, he knows how to make a blockbuster. The Pod Racing scene is so cool and different, and that last battle with Dark Maul, Qui-Gon, and Obi Wan is absolutely amazing. The worst part about Phantom Menace is the sheer promise of greatness, but if we really look deeper, this is just a poor movie, with much talented wasted, regardless of its successors and heritage."
"Feb 09, 2012",2.5,"It's not a terrible film, but please do me a solid and refuse to see it in 3D. There is absolutely no reason this movie should have been re-released in 3D. Even the good ones shouldn't be re-released in 3D, the original trilogy already got their re-release 15 years ago. 3D sucks and the fact that George Lucas and the studios are rubbing this mediocre film in our faces is an insult. Please do not give them any of your money and just watch the original trilogy at home instead."
"Feb 09, 2012",3.5,"Lucas has captured the imagination of yet another generation with his re-release of Episode 1, The Phantom Menace  in 3D. Every kid that came out of the theater had to look back at the poster, like we would back in 1977. Isn't that what its all about after all? Kids and adults alike were amuzed and less bothered with the infamous Jar Jar Binks.There were cheering and applause after the Pod Race and at the Finale. The re-release seemed much clearer, move much faster and was much more enjoyable than the original release. Some scenes were much closer than I remember and much more detailed. Yes the 3D effects weren't perfect, and they work better on all the CG shots and characters than in others places but remember this was originally shot in analog, not in digital. Regardless, its come a long way from its original release in 1999. I for one along with my two kids look forward to Episoide 2 ""Attack of the Clones"" which was shot entirely in Digital and should make for a much better transformation to 3D."
"Feb 09, 2012",5,Sure it doesn't have good character development but honestly who cares.
"Feb 09, 2012",5,thmbs up for star wars
"Feb 09, 2012",1,"It's bad enough when this originally came out, even worse is Jar Jar Binks in 3D and Jake Lloyd as the most disliked child star in Hollywood history."
"Feb 09, 2012",3,"Though the story was simple, and not to mention, predictable, Star Wars Episode I take the Jedi to a totally different level. This is the movie to know more about the Jedi and the old republic."
"Feb 09, 2012",1,"2d, 3d, 4d it doesn't matter. This movie sucks balls."
"Feb 09, 2012",4,"Considering as the weakest and least favorite of the star wars franchise from critics and fans point of view, I can honestly see why. But to be honest, I actually enjoyed it! The problems I have in the movie is the exact same problems the fans had about it, the acting! There is no acting effort or anything, except for Liam neilson's performance and a slight few of others. But the rest completely fooled me to think that they were robots, not actual actors, but my biggest problem of the Is this, jar-jar binks! I really hate this guy! For he's simply the most annoying, uncreative, unnessisary character I've ever seen on screen! Now the good of the movie, everything else! The story is really good and marks as an interesting beginning of the saga, the action is awesome, the effects are really fascinating, and it's simply eye candy, for it kept my focus throughout the entire time! I enjoyed watching it, and I'll enjoy watching this entire franchise, from an official star wars fan! B"
"Feb 09, 2012",3.5,"Aside from the divided fanbase of people who either love or hate this film, I actually quite like it for what it is. It expands the Star Wars Universe in an interesting and exciting way. I would also agree with many of the films flaws, with much of it's convoluted plotting unevenly paced and script flaws with many other questionable creative decisions. But my inner Jedi still echos how much excitement and an epic time I have when watching it. My queries with the characters were how they were written more than how they were performed by such a great cast, and sometimes I like to impersonate Jar Jar Binks (Its now hard to say I liked the character). The film sets out the universe in a way we have to familiarize with and I think Lucas has done it quite well. I would agree its certainly high on Special Effects, some of it quite dated otherwise still enjoyable for the film's fantasy element, never has a Star Wars film before this one, been limited to or brought so much diverse creativity than any before it."
"Feb 09, 2012",4,"So Star Wars the Phantom Menace is back and in 3D.This is the one film that splits fans; for some it's an alright movie for the others it is a cancerous sour on the world. For me I quiet liked it when it first came out, so went in with an open mind. It essentially is the Blu Ray on the big screen with 3D. But Lucas and co have done something which most film makers can't do even when shooting in 3D, which is use it correctly and make it look good. By that I mean it adds depth and contrast not make it look like your looking at a prismatic image or the cheap trick spike out of the screen gimmick, but proper depth. The clarity added by the touch ups Lucas is always doing is welcome, the picture is crisp and pops wonderfully. 

When the dual of fates started the hairs on the back of my neck got that same feeling the first time I watched it. It looks phenomenal. 

True it's not the best thing Lucas ever did but it's not as bad as everyone harps on about. It actually has some of the best acting in the entire saga largely due to Pernilla August who over shadows almost every other actor ever to be in any Star Wars movie.

It's worth a watch and if the quality is this good it'll be worth the wait for episode 3 and the originals."
"Feb 09, 2012",2,I know I'm gonna hate myself for it but I still want to see this in 3D.
"Feb 09, 2012",5,"Star wars is ace,Ewan macgregor is a cunt. Luckily the franchise has the force to float his concrete boots so as not to watch his dreadful acting sink the monopoly like a medieval  witch with a penis shaped anvil strung about her yoda skinned neck. Jedi Jizz."
"Feb 09, 2012",1,"The film is dull and boring, but the 3D, while uneven and inconsistent (some scenes were made blurrier due to the extra dimension and others felt flat), was surprisingly really well done adding a needed dimension of depth and serving to enhance several shots including the two main action scenes, which both are fantastic in the extra dimension. While I can't recommend this film, I can say that if by some strange reason you find yourself attending a screening of this film, feel comforted by the fact that you will be getting your extra money's worth as far as the 3D goes....wish I could say more for the film itself."
"Feb 09, 2012",2.5,Not the best Star Wars movie (maybe the worst)  but its still worth it and now my son can start from the beginning!
"Feb 09, 2012",4.5,"Star Wars is now also getting the 3D treatment, starting with the one everybody loves to hate. Find faults as people will with the story and characters, but the technical aspect of the movie is excellent. The 3D conversion for this film is done quite well. Some scene had more 3D depth mainly because it wasn't action sequences, and sweeping landscape shots benefit from this. For me the main reason is to just experience Star Wars once again on the big screen, the way it always should be seen. The pod race, the lightsaber battle and Liam Neeson are reasons enough to watch this re-release."
"Feb 09, 2012",3,"The Movie Is Good? But In 3D Is A Waist Of Money To Watch It Is Not Even Really A 3D Is Sucks Just Like The Lion King In 3D!?!?!?

Los efectos por supuesto increíbles. A pesar de lo malo sigue siendo Star Wars, sigue siendo divertida y ofrece muchas cosas para disfrutar de esta galaxia muy muy lejana!"
"Feb 08, 2012",0.5,"The Phantom Menace is unforgettable in how utterly forgettable it is. Its best moments shine only because they do not induce cringes. Every intriguing concept or storytelling device is an accident. While Revenge of the Sith was just good enough to make one angry at the opportunities it missed, Phantom Menace will make future generations wonder whether we had any taste at all. It is literally impossible to enjoy this movie on any objective level. Do not go see it."

"Feb 08, 2012",5,"I have all 6 film on VHS, DVD &amp; BLU-RAY. so watching in 3D is a must"
"Feb 08, 2012",3.5,it's not great. At all. But it still has its moments and still takes me back to when I was a kid seeing it for the first time.
"Feb 08, 2012",2,It's not a bad movie but..... it's just not Star Wars. *begins crying and putting Star Wars Episode IV into DVD Player*
"Feb 08, 2012",2.5,Noah is going to make me see this I am sure. Damn you George Lucas!
"Feb 08, 2012",2,This movie is TOO LONG and the weakest link of the Star Wars franchise.
"Feb 08, 2012",4,Gonna see it Saturday!!!!
"Feb 08, 2012",1.5,"Just awful. Nobody truly enjoys this, it isn't genetically possible."
"Feb 08, 2012",3.5,Not the best outta the 6 films. Still worth to see in 3D and its always a fun story.
"Feb 08, 2012",1.5,"The biggest cinematic disappointment of a generation. Now in 3D! 

 it's not even Jake Lloyds best film."
"Feb 08, 2012",4,"When to see it with my 5 year old son, he loved it. 3D did not improve the film for me, but it didn't suck as bad as the first time due to lower expectations. Great to introduce kids to the series at the theater."
"Feb 08, 2012",3,"Probably the worst Star Wars movie up to date. The prequels are horrible, and uncomfortable to watch."
"Feb 08, 2012",0.5,Really? Didn't we see this about 10 years ago.  Why are we indulging the OCD in Lucas.  IT'S FINE ALREADY!
"Feb 08, 2012",2,"An incredibly pointless and highly disappointing adaptation of the short and uninteresting back story behind Star Wars. A talented cast is wasted on one-dimensional characters and the script is laden with boring political dialogue. And to top things off, we are introduced to the two most annoying characters in all of Star Wars: Anakin Skywalker and Jar Jar Binks."
"Feb 08, 2012",1.5,3D just wasnt as good as I Hoped it would've been. Expect more out of Episode II.
"Feb 08, 2012",2.5,Only liked it cuz of Darth Maul and only watched for Natalie Portman.
"Feb 08, 2012",0.5,My god now we can watch JAR JAR in 3D. Just another crummy money maker that people will go see at the theatres even though half the world knows this garbage storylin(which isn't saying much).
"Feb 07, 2012",4,love the change to yoda. if Mr Lucas desides to make more changes I would suggest cutting out about 80% of jar jar's scenes there is no need for his stupidity in the film. stuff the kids Mr Lucas these films were ment to make the original star wars fans happy cut out jar jar I implore you sir.
"Feb 07, 2012",3,Not the best out of the Star wars Trilogy but still an Interesting watch... I wish Darth maul had more Air time!!
"Feb 07, 2012",2.5,One of the worst star wars movies...why would i want to watch this in 3D?
"Feb 07, 2012",0.5,"Why in the name of all that is holy do people rate this movie higher than 20%?  I ask the same about CRYSTAL SKULL and EPISODES 2 and 3, but ESPECIALLY PHANTOM MENACE and CRYSTAL SKULL.  Each of those movies took a cherished series of movies that ranged from extremely well-crafted to outright life-changingly awesome and shat all over their memories.

Two and a half.  There are two and a half good things about this movie.

1: Ewan McGregor is spot-on casting for a young Ben Kenobi.

2: As always, the visuals and effects are amazing.  Pointless, but amazing.

1/2: Darth Maul, has he lasted more then two minutes, had the potential to be awesome.

But where do I begin?  

Insulting racial stereotypes substituting for unique alien languages?  This movie has at least three.

Boring plotline that nobody cares about?  ('Cause this movie is essentially about a Trade Federation.  What were the first three STAR WARS films about?  The growth of Luke Skywalker's character.)

Wooden dialogue?

Bad acting?

This movie should last ten minutes, including the entire opening credits and it would be just fine.

Maybe."
"Feb 07, 2012",3.5,The force is slightly strong with this one.
"Feb 07, 2012",3,"Worst Star Wars movie of the 6, but three stars, none the less, because it is a Star Wars movie. Hardcore fan till I die!"
"Feb 07, 2012",0.5,the prequel trilogy is torture to watch !  RIP Star Wars 1977-1998
"Feb 07, 2012",2,"After seeing all the Star Wars multiple times it has become apparent that the real problem are the characters and there lack of interesting human traits or personality. Seeing Episode 1, 2 and 3 make you miss the humor of Harrison Ford. In fact after much thought, Harrison Ford is clearly the best thing about the Star Wars series. As special effects become dated, there will be far less interest. It has been a bit sickening how we are expected to continue to buy the latest edition. First was the individual episodes on VCR, then a 3 pack on VCR of episodes 4,5, &amp;6. The DVD, then blu-ray and now 3D. What is wrong with us?"
"Feb 07, 2012",2,"I'd rather watch my parents home movies featuring the dog they put to sleep when I was 6. Oh, but the Darth Maul ending was pretty sweet."
"Feb 07, 2012",1,"Who was the main character? The Pod Race is interesting and the Light Saber battles are neat, but there is no substance here."
"Feb 07, 2012",2,"I hate you Jar-Jar, I hate you SO much..."
"Feb 07, 2012",1.5,Pretty abysmal. But the pod race is exciting.
"Feb 07, 2012",4,"Definatly not the best of the series, the Phantom Menace is still a good movie.  Although it introduced us to the most hated character of all time (may his name be never spoken again), but it provided a good launching point for the prequels.  I would definately reccomend it to fans of Star Wars but with newcommers, I would highly reccomend seeing the original trilogy first and seeing how that works out."
"Feb 07, 2012",3,See it if you have never heard of star wars
"Feb 07, 2012",1.5,"Terrible writing, a mostly horrible cast and a racist character made only to make money all add up to one of the worst movies ever made. However, two of the new characters, Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul, played by Liam Neeson and Ray Park respectively, are positive additions to the series."
"Feb 07, 2012",4.5,"This is coming from someone who's not way into '3D,' but the conversion on this film is nothing short of amazing."
"Feb 07, 2012",3,Not really worth the 3D. Still good to see it on the big screen
"Feb 07, 2012",2.5,I've seen it soo many times that I rather not ever see it again.
"Feb 07, 2012",3,this is the beginning of the star wars decline until the star wars the clone wars tv series
"Feb 07, 2012",3,"Natalie Portman and the awesome battle at the end make up for jar jar binks, awkward semi child molestation scenes, and Liam Neeson dieing"
"Feb 07, 2012",0.5,"I really dislike this movie. Of course I liked it when I first watched it when I was seven but going back to it now, it's just unbearable. It doesn't make any sense and is very convoluted. I honesty do not know the reason for people wanting to go see this in theaters... Again."
"Feb 07, 2012",0.5,F this movie in its stupid f-ing a
"Feb 07, 2012",1,"Liked as a kid, simply because it was ""Star Wars"". Now I don't see any appeal besides the entertaining spectacle of CGI special effects and intense sound."
"Feb 07, 2012",2,"Ska försöka orka igenom alla filmerna, men jag har lite svårt för de         ""nyare"" upplagorna."
"Feb 07, 2012",3.5,Not a very good Star Wars film and as for the 3D... It was pretty garbage.
"Feb 07, 2012",4.5,"It's different and wierd to be back after so long, but all the same great. I applaud George Lucas for sticking to it and seeing the whole thing through himself, anyone else would've quite possibly ruined it. Ewan McGregor is perfect as Obi Wan, and the all star cast including  Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson are superb. If only they hadn't included that annoying, uninteresting and pointless digital character of Jar-Jar Binks. All up a good start to the prelude of the series, with some dynamic special effects(I especially love the canyon race scene.)"
"Feb 06, 2012",3.5,"The Phantom Menace in 3D is decent enough. The pod race sequence is the extended version and that dreadful Yoda puppet had been replaced with a superior looking CG version. The story, acting, and direction still suffer in places like it did back in 1999 (I'd still like to see Jake Lloyd replaced with just about anyone - Maybe even Plank from Ed, Edd, and Eddie). The 3D was well done in places, but hardly noticeable throughout a bulk of the film. I say its worth seeing in the theater once, but if you're not a fan there isn't going to be enough new to make it worth your time and money."
"Feb 06, 2012",2,One star for each blade of Darth Maul's lightsaber.
"Feb 06, 2012",4,Not as bad as everyone says
"Feb 06, 2012",5,My favourite Series but not my Favourite Episode
"Feb 06, 2012",1.5,RedLetterMedia's review. Nuff said.
"Feb 06, 2012",3,"I didn't see any 3D in this movie, but the movie is still good! Lol"
"Feb 06, 2012",2,Two starts for the lightsaber fight.  Other than that this movie sucked.
"Feb 06, 2012",4,The great saga begins
"Feb 06, 2012",2.5,"While the look and visuals are something to behold, the storytelling is flat and the characters are lifeless cutouts."
"Feb 06, 2012",2,Ruined the franchise for me. Didn't even go see part II or III in the theatre
"Feb 06, 2012",2.5,"As a true Star Wars fan, this movie just did not compare to the others and Jar Jar Binks was an awful character. As a stand alone movie maybe it had some potential because all the other characters were so good. But as the first movie to one of the best stories, it falls short."
"Feb 06, 2012",3.5,Not as good as the original trilogy but definitely better than 2 and 3!
"Feb 06, 2012",4,"A far far better movie than anyone gives it credit for, I saw Star Wars Episode One in the theater on the very first day, first showing.  My mom even stood in line for me and my brother so that we'd be guaranteed tickets.  I was 12 years old, and it seemed like Episode One was the greatest movie I'd ever watched.  Nothing on Earth could've been better to me.  That's where people miss the whole point of this film.  It was never intended to be some adult pleasing continuation or fanboy satisfying retrospective on the original films.  This movie was unabashedly, unashamedly made for the very people who fell in love with the first movie in 1977: children.  Somewhere along the way, those same children grew up, became jaded and embittered (Comic Book Guy from Simpsons anyone?)  They felt that they somehow owned George Lucas's own creation just because they had supported it.
  
Therein lies the hubris and foolishness of today's comic book geek.  They feel entitled.  All I can tell them is that the white knuckle entertainment, incredibly effects, lightning speed pacing and fascinating worlds full of new characters and places were enough to entitle me to all the entertainment this 12 year old at heart could've ever asked for.  So do your children a favor (and yourself while you're at it) and give Episode I a try.  It just might be better than you've heard it is."
"Feb 06, 2012",2,"The characters are all dull and carry very little if any personality at all, and the plot is much less exciting than any of the other films. I don't think the children who are the targeted audience will be bored by the premise and pathetic jokes that come across in this film. For when the film came out, with such high expectations, it became infuriating to fans. The only things that work in this film would be the pod races and the three-way battle between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul. C"
"Feb 06, 2012",0.5,George Lucas riding the gravy train.
"Feb 06, 2012",3.5,The Light Sabre fighting is what we came for .. and it's brilliant. BUT that obnoxious kid has to be one of the worst feats of casting ever.
"Feb 06, 2012",1,1 star for being a greedy bastard Lucad
"Feb 06, 2012",4,cant wait to see it in 3D
"Feb 06, 2012",1,An awful boring mess. Everyone involved should hang their heads in shame. One star for nice special effects.
"Feb 06, 2012",1,Ruined my childhood.
"Feb 06, 2012",5,It's star wars.. Enough said ... But what isn't good about is the terrible converted 3D
"Feb 06, 2012",0.5,"Don't waste your time, stick with the Episodes III thru XI"
"Feb 06, 2012",2,"For die-hard, discerning fans of the original trilogy, this movie was an appalling disappointment."
"Feb 06, 2012",2.5,3D.....not going to make the movie any better :(  But to be fair...imo.....3D doesn't make any movie  better - Except the Harold and Kumar Christmas!
"Feb 06, 2012",1,Not even the rose-tinted glasses of youth can save this disaster.
"Feb 06, 2012",5,It was Jeditastic!!!!!! There isn't enough stars to give it.
"Feb 06, 2012",3.5,"cut out anything to do with jar jar binks, and it's a good movie."
"Feb 05, 2012",3,"Darth Maul, Nuff Said"
"Feb 05, 2012",0.5,Totally shit. I can't believe I'm going to pay again to see it in 3D. Mson is going to make the same mistake as me.
"Feb 05, 2012",0.5,"WTF is all that can be said, way too many things wrong with this one and it's isn't even the worst one"
"Feb 05, 2012",2.5,i haven't seen that movie since i was 5
"Feb 05, 2012",5,I am a major Star Wars fan and I had to go and see this opening night and of course there was no disappointment in it and I can't wait to see the others in 3D as well
"Feb 05, 2012",5,It's star wars who doesn't love it and it's in 3D even better
"Feb 05, 2012",5,fav movies of all time.. now in 3D
"Feb 05, 2012",1,Please Mr Lucas just retire.
"Feb 05, 2012",2.5,"Terrible direction, acting, dialogue and bullet-holed story. Yet a phenomenal lightsaber duel and a character that could have been utilized much better in Darth Maul, are the only highlights of this travesty."
"Feb 05, 2012",0.5,One of the worst films of all time. Taking a classic trilogy and then cleaning the toilet floor with it.
"Feb 05, 2012",0.5,"Why repeat the past with the 3D added on the side...AND WHY IS YODA CGI, WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE PUPPET YODA OF 1999?????"
"Feb 04, 2012",1.5,"I feel guilty about picking on this film since everyone seems to go out of their way to complain about it. However, I then find myself thinking about the dull senate scenes, the boring pod race, the presence of Jar Jar Binks, and the complete inability for George Lucas to put the talent of Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, or Ewan McGregor to efficacious use. Star Wars: Episode I began a prequel trilogy that possesses all the flaws of the earlier movies while lacking any of their numerous strengths."
"Feb 04, 2012",3,The worst of the 6...but still a decent movie compared to so many other modern CGI fests.
"Feb 04, 2012",4,"This movie has comedy, action, and everything else need to make an amazing film. I remember seeing it in theatres when it first came out and watching it over and over as a kid. With a PG rating, it is a great addition to the Star Wars saga, and always will be."
"Feb 04, 2012",3,"3 stars for the original, but 4 stars for the Phantom Edit."
"Feb 04, 2012",2,Darth Maul was amazing. Liam Neeson was the best Jedi. That is all worth seeing here.
"Feb 04, 2012",0.5,i hate jar jar binks by far worst star wars movie ever made.
"Feb 04, 2012",3,Definitely the weakest of both the saga and the prequel trilogy.
"Feb 04, 2012",3,"Look at the positives in this movie Darth Maul, Podrace, ...."
"Feb 04, 2012",2,probably the best of the prequels and sadly thats not saying much.....and no jar jar has not been digitally edited out :(
"Feb 04, 2012",1.5,"Going into seeing Star Wars Episode 1 in 3D I already knew that ""The Phantom Menace"" was the weakest of the 6 films.  Jar Jar Binks, Jake Lloyd,  uninspired dialogue and lulls in the action while what is essentially an ""origin"" tale sets up the background for the Star Wars saga all contribute to the film's weaknesses.  But the film also offered some state of the art CGI,  Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor,  Darth Maul and some well choreographed light sabre fights.

The only reason to see this film was to check out the conversion to 3D.  Sadly the 3D is more subtle than eye popping.  Probably because back in 1999 when the film was made nobody was thinking about the possibility of using 3D.    The 3D technology, when used in films like ""Avatar"" and  ""Hugo"" can enhance the film's environment while in films like ""Piranha 3D"" the process overpowers the film and becomes no more than a gimmick.

I can only recommend this film for hard core Star Wars fans that want to experience the 3D conversion but I warn you that disappointment awaits.  Perhaps by the time Lucasfilms converts ""The Empire Strikes Back"" , the best film in the saga, the technology will have advanced enough to create a stunning film.  I'd rather see George Lucas scrap the 3d conversion idea and allow some other writers, directors and visual technicians to play with his  Star Wars mythos and get working on a seventh film."
