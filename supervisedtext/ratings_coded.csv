I got notes of (duh!) Ozu‚Äôs Good Morning, among other things, especially apparent in the right-angled framing of living arrangements and the privileging of adolescents and, alongside a similar use of it in Tati‚Äôs filmmaking, the discontinuity right-angle cutting throughout is especially playful.

Wes' artistic philosophy wrapped in a delightfully slight genre packaging, only to expose startling moments of metaphysical emotional clarity, moments which thematically, narratively mean nothing except us, the spectators. A reinvention, completely and utterly inaccessible, a companion piece to French Dispatch, something which connects the tangents and musings into a cohesive whole. Of course Wes would make this in the era of soulless TikTok imitations.",0

5,"The last time Wes Anderson took us on a class trip to the theatre, optional safety glasses and earplugs were provided to all patrons. With his scintillating and archly metafictional new work, Asteroid City, he allows us to bask in the frivolous delights of a play, while also carefully dismantling the process of artistic creation in real time. It‚Äôs the type of film you might imagine the great Max Fischer himself might have directed had his scholastic brief encompassed a bells-and-whistles homage to mid-century pulp science fiction.
