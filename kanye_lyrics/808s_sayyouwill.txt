Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake, sleep (less in June) or (missing you)

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will

I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will
