Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
I, go, go for mine, I gots to shine
I'ma get on the TV momma, I'ma
I'ma put shit down

Welcome to the good life, where niggas who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi
Ah! (Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!

Yo, it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
I, go, go for mine, I gots to shine
I'ma get on the TV momma, I'ma
I'ma put shit down

Welcome to the good life!
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got mo' (ass than the models)
The good life, so keep it comin' with the bottles
Cause she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C
It feel like V.A. or the Bay or Yay
Ay, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)
Homey tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood (Welcome to the good life)
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would (Welcome to the good life!)
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should (Welcome to the good life)
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
I, go, go for mine, I gots to shine
I'ma get on the TV momma, I'ma
I'ma put shit down

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
Cause (the good life) I always had a passion for flashin'
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life
