I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she’s down for the night
Slow down the time
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma ma se, ma ma se, ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms, still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms, still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
