Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know
Let me...

Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing, in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and I paid my fare
See I know my destination, but I'm just not there

In the streets
In the streets
I'm just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair
