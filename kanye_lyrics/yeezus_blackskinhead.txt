For my theme song  
My leather black jeans on  
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom  
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in  
Came to see me in my black skin  
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin'  
If I don't get ran out by Catholics  
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control
But there's nowhere to go
And there's no way to slow
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

Stop all that coon shit  
Early morning cartoon shit  
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch  
Black out the room, bitch  
Stop all that coon shit  
These niggas ain't doin' shit  
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control
But there's nowhere to go
And there's no way to slow
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
God!
