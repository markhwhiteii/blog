On lonely nights, I start to fade
On lonely nights, I start to fade
Her love's a thousand miles away
Her love's a thousand miles away

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter

It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep
It's 4 a.m. and I can't sleep
Her love is all that I can see
Her love is all that I can see

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Memories made in the coldest winter, winter, winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?

If spring can take the snow away
If spring can take the snow away
Can it melt away all of our mistakes
Can it melt away all of our mistakes

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, I won't ever love again
Never again
